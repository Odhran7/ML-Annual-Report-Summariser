 item 1a risk factors 

howmet’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the company’s business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows including causing its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to howmet or that howmet currently deems immaterial may also adversely affect the company materially in future periods 

risks related to our business and operations 

our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows have been and could continue to be adversely impacted materially by the continued effects of the covid19 pandemic 

the covid19 pandemic affecting the global community has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows and the nature and extent of the impact over time remain highly uncertain the impact over time will depend on future developments that are beyond our control including the duration of the pandemic the continued severity of the virus resurgences and emergence of variants of the virus the efficacy and availability or uptake of vaccines and related drugs and the actions that may be taken in response to covid19 such as vaccine mandates manufacturing restrictions labor policies and travel limitations the longer the pandemic’s duration the greater the potential impact on our business and the more heightened the risk of a continuing material adverse effect on our company business strategies and initiatives 

• business and operations risks we continue to monitor covid19 guidance and requirements to determine whether we will need to modify our business practices or take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our stakeholders including our continuing focus on the safety and protection of our workforce if there are restrictions on or disruptions to our business practices we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our operational costs may increase the covid19 pandemic has resulted in increased operational challenges which have included and may in the future include manufacturing site shutdowns and workplace disruptions we may also face challenges in restoring our production levels if and when covid19 abates if we are unable to reinstate our workforce at the levels needed or if our suppliers experience disruptions that impact their ability to provide goods or services to us as a result of covid19 and its negative impact on the aerospace and commercial transportation markets the possibility exists that a corresponding sustained impact to our operations financial results and market capitalization may require material impairments of our assets including but not limited to goodwill and other intangible assets longlived assets and rightofuse assets 

• customer risks  we have limited visibility into future demand due to the disruptions resulting from covid19 the significant decrease in air travel resulting from the covid19 pandemic and the measures that governments and private organizations worldwide have implemented in an attempt to contain its spread has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect airlines and aircraft manufacturers and their respective demand for our and our customers’ products and services aircraft manufacturers have reduced and may continue to reduce production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and as a result demand for products in the oem market has significantly decreased several of our aerospace customers previously suspended operations at certain production sites reduced operations and production rates andor took costcutting actions including but not limited to general electric company raytheon technologies corporation and the boeing company which represented approximately 13  9 and 5 respectively of our thirdparty sales in 2021 due to reduced air traffic and flight cycles spares and aftermarket demand has declined and could remain low until air travel levels return the decrease in domestic and international air travel due to the pandemic has adversely affected demand for narrowbody and widebody aircraft respectively while domestic air travel has increased during the second half of 2021 international travel has not yet begun to recover and the commercial widebody aircraft market may take longer to recover in addition several of our commercial transportation customers have encountered and may continue to encounter challenges in their ability to increase production rates to meet demand due to supply chain constraints stemming from the pandemic due to the foregoing factors and other costcutting measures by our customers we are experiencing and expect to continue experiencing lower demand and volume for our products in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic may negatively impact customer contract negotiations including the ability to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations and our ability to obtain new customers ultimately the demand for our products is driven by the demand for transportation and travel within and between various countries 

• market liquidity and credit risks  financial market dynamics and volatility due to covid19 could pose heightened risks to our liquidity including those discussed below in “—risks related to liquidity and capital resources” if the covid19 pandemic continues for a prolonged period it could adversely affect our financial condition including with respect to satisfying both required and voluntary pension funding requirements could result in potential increases in 

net debt or reductions in ebitda and could otherwise negatively affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives if the foregoing or other factors negatively impact our ability to comply with the financial covenant in our fiveyear revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” our ability to draw under the credit agreement would be adversely affected conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding or our ability to refinance certain portions of our indebtedness 

the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed herein including but not limited to risks related to global economic conditions competition loss of customers costs of supplies supply chain disruptions manufacturing difficulties and disruptions investment returns our credit profile our credit ratings and interest rates we expect that the longer the period of disruption from covid19 continues the more material the adverse impact will be on our business operations financial performance results of operations andor cash flows 

the markets for howmet’s products are cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

howmet is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals enduse markets howmet sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the aerospace and commercial transportation industries and the demand for our products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by our customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond our control in particular howmet derives a significant portion of our revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry which is cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft and spare parts the us and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs demand for commercial aircraft and spare parts is influenced by airline industry profitability trends in airline passenger traffic the state of us regional and world economies the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors the defense aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding however it is also driven by the effects of terrorism a changing global geopolitical environment us foreign policy the retirement of older military aircraft and technological improvements to new engines and airframes further the demand for howmet’s commercial transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by commercial transportation manufacturers commercial transportation sales and production are affected by many factors including the age of the vehicle fleet labor relations issues fuel prices regulatory requirements government initiatives trade agreements and levels of competition howmet is unable to predict the future course of industry variables the strength of the us regional or global economies or the effects of government actions negative economic conditions such as a major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a material disruption of or manufacturing difficulties at howmet’s manufacturing operations could adversely affect howmet’s business 

if howmet’s operations particularly one of its key manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted including because of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism theft sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes labor shortages or other reasons howmet may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to or demand from its customers in addition the manufacture of many of howmet’s products is a complex process manufacturing problems arising from equipment failure or malfunction inadvertent failure to follow regulatory or customer specifications and procedures including those related to quality or safety and problems with raw materials could have an adverse impact on the company’s ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance requirements which may result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation adversely impacting product demand and customer relationships interruptions in production capability could increase howmet’s costs and reduce its sales including causing the company to incur costs for premium freight make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fulfill customer orders additionally a delivery delay by us due to production interruptions could subject us to liability from customer claims that such delay resulted in losses to the customer furthermore product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls customer penalties contract cancellation and product liability exposure in addition to a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations because of approval license and qualification requirements applicable to manufacturers andor their suppliers sources of alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to howmet or its customers 

howmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for materials and services essential to our operations including raw materials and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

howmet has supply arrangements with suppliers for various materials and services including raw materials we maintain annual or longterm contracts for a majority of our supply requirements and for the remainder we depend on spot purchases there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or obtain replacements for any of our longterm contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements or at all supply constraints could impact our production or 

force us to purchase materials and other supplies from alternative sources which may not be available in sufficient quantities or on terms that are favorable to us howmet could also have exposure if a key supplier is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis the availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of howmet’s products may be influenced by private or government entities including as a result of changes in geopolitical conditions or regulatory requirements labor relations between the producers and their work forces and unstable governments in exporting nations any of the foregoing supply chain disruptions or those due to capacity constraints trade barriers labor shortages business continuity quality cyberattacks transportation delivery or logistics challenges weather natural disaster or pandemic events could adversely affect howmet’s business results of operations or financial condition 

howmet’s business could be adversely affected by increases in raw material manufacturing and operating costs due to inflation and other market forces or governmental constraints 

howmet may be adversely affected by raw material freight energy labor and other manufacturing and operating cost increases the costs of certain raw materials including but not limited to nickel titanium aluminum cobalt and rhenium necessary for the manufacture of howmet’s products and other manufacturing and operating costs may be influenced by inflation market forces of supply and demand shortages export limits sanctions new or increased import duties and countervailing or antidumping duties while we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material costs to our customers through contractual agreements in the form of price increases there can be a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products additionally we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors if the company is unable to offset significant cost increases through customer price increases productivity improvements cost reduction or other programs howmet’s business operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

howmet’s business depends in part on its ability to successfully meet increased program demand production targets and commitments 

howmet is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial general aviation military aircraft and aircraft engine programs many of these contracts contemplate production increases over the next several years if howmet fails to meet production targets and commitments or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business operating results or financial condition similarly to the extent demand for our products increases rapidly and significantly in future periods whether as a result of general market conditions the end of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise we may not be able to ramp up production quickly enough to meet the demand we may also face difficulties in competing for and recruiting qualified employees these difficulties could result in significant delivery delays that could damage howmet’s reputation and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations or competitive position 

failure to attract and retain a skilled global workforce or to provide adequate succession planning for key personnel could adversely affect howmet’s operations and competitiveness 

howmet’s global operations require skilled personnel with relevant industry and technical experience shortages in certain skills in areas such as engineering manufacturing and technology and other labor market inadequacies have created more competition for talent a sustained labor shortage lack of skilled labor increased turnover labor inflation or increase in general labor costs whether caused by covid19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors could lead to higher labor recruiting or training costs to attract and retain personnel in addition the company’s headcount reductions to align our operations with reduced demand due to covid19 could make it difficult to refill the eliminated positions as business recovers if the company fails to attract develop and retain a global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business our operations could be adversely impacted furthermore the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company’s growth and business strategy the loss of key members of management could significantly harm howmet’s business and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the company’s institutional knowledge base result in loss of technical or other expertise delay or impede the execution of the company’s business plans and erode howmet’s competitiveness 

howmet could be adversely affected by the loss of key customers or significant changes in the business or financial condition of its customers 

howmet has longterm contracts with a significant number of its customers some of which are subject to renewal renegotiation or repricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions howmet’s failure to successfully renew renegotiate or favorably reprice such agreements or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships could result in a reduction or loss in customer purchase volume or revenue additionally a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by howmet could adversely affect howmet’s financial results howmet’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses for example our sales could continue to 

be negatively affected by the residual impacts of the boeing 737 max grounding in 2019 as well as boeing’s pause in deliveries of its 787 aircraft since may 2021 that has resulted in boeing’s significantly reduced 787 production rates howmet’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with howmet including to reduce the amount of howmet’s products they purchase to switch to alternative suppliers or to enter into the markets themselves to compete with howmet if howmet’s customers reduce terminate or delay purchases from howmet due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and howmet is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

howmet’s products are used in a variety of military applications including military aircraft although many of the military programs in which howmet participates extend several years changes in military strategy policy and priorities or reductions in defense spending may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for howmet’s products which could adversely affect howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

information technology system failures cyberattacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of howmet’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences having a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

howmet’s information technology systems could be subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer network and telecommunications failures computer viruses catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by employees if howmet’s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly the company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and howmet may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations any material disruption in the company’s information technology systems or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems could have an adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to the security of our and our customers’ suppliers’ and thirdparty service providers’ products systems and networks and the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data the company believes that it faces threats of cyberattacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication although past attacks have not resulted in known losses of any critical data or had a material impact on howmet’s financial condition or results of operations the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use the company’s systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data block access to its systems or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact howmet’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

howmet faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in “competitive conditions” in part i item 1 business of this report the markets for howmet’s products are highly competitive howmet’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in our product markets which could include existing customers new entrants in our markets new product offerings new andor emerging technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace howmet products the willingness of customers to accept alternate solutions for the products sold by howmet the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for howmet’s products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting howmet’s competitors or customers could adversely affect howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition howmet may face increased competition due to industry consolidation as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions companies could be acquired or merged companies that are strategic partners in some areas of howmet’s business may acquire or form alliances with howmet’s competitors thereby reducing their business with howmet industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers consolidation within howmet’s customer base may result in customers who are better able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect howmet’s profitability consolidation within howmet’s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for howmet’s products if a combined entity replaces howmet’s products with those of howmet’s competitors with which it has prior relationships the result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business operating results and financial condition 

howmet’s competitive position and future performance depends in part on the company’s ability to develop and innovate products deploy technology initiatives and implement advanced manufacturing technologies while howmet intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or achieve and maintain technological advantages 

risks related to liquidity and capital resources

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect howmet’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

howmet’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense howmet records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans by reductions in the fair value of plan assets and by other factors howmet calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by howmet to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition howmet is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how howmet’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note h to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8  

adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans additionally unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could lead to a decline in the plans’ funded status and result in higher than expected pension contributions the foregoing factors may adversely affect the company’s financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

dividends and share repurchases fall within the discretion of our board of directors depend on a number of factors and are subject to limits under the company’s credit agreement 

share repurchases and the declaration of dividends fall within the discretion of howmet’s board of directors and the board’s decision regarding such matters depends on many factors including howmet’s financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations covenants associated with certain of the company’s debt obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant in addition under the credit agreement during the year ending december 31 2022 unless the company ends this period earlier in accordance with the agreement or otherwise common stock dividends and share repurchases are permitted only if no borrowings are outstanding under the credit agreement and are limited to an aggregate amount of 500 million the company previously suspended dividends in april 2020 to preserve cash and provide flexibility in light of the impact of the covid19 pandemic but resumed dividend payments in the third quarter of 2021 there can be no assurance that the company will declare dividends or repurchase stock in the future in any particular amounts or at all

howmet may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the company’s reputation business and competitive position 

howmet owns important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets the company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining howmet’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the company serves howmet’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to howmet’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents howmet owns or licenses despite its controls and safeguards howmet’s technology may be misappropriated by its employees its competitors or other third parties the pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of howmet intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient further in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of misappropriation of howmet intellectual property increases despite efforts the company undertakes to protect it developments or assertions by or against 

howmet relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce howmet’s rights sufficiently could adversely affect howmet’s business and competitive position 

howmet may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy

howmet is subject to privacy and data securityprotection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 and was recently updated imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data as well as significant fines for noncompliance compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes which could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s financial condition and results of operations in addition the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the gdpr or other privacy and information security laws as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach could damage the company’s reputation 

labor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of howmet’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1 business of this report howmet may not be able to renegotiate satisfactorily collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at howmet’s facilities in the future howmet may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business results 

howmet is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws such as the fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and recordkeeping state and local wage laws the employee retirement income security act “erisa” and regulations related to safety discrimination organizing whistleblowing classification of employees privacy citizenship requirements and healthcare insurance mandates class action lawsuits can result from alleged violations of state employment laws allegations that howmet has violated such laws or regulations could damage the company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages 

payable to former employees which could have a material adverse impact on howmet’s business results of operation and financial condition 

howmet is exposed to environmental health and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities 

howmet’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations as well as participation in assessments and cleanups of sites and internal voluntary programs have been and in the future could be significant environmental matters for which howmet may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates at sites that it may acquire in the future or at thirdparty sites used by howmet its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal compliance with health safety and environmental laws and regulations including remediation obligations may impact howmet’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period

howmet may be affected by global climate change or by legal and regulatory responses to such change 

increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives such as capandtrade systems additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases and corporate average fuel economy “cafe” standards in the united states new or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect howmet and its customers and suppliers including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows additionally howmet utilizes natural gas electricity and other fuels to operate its facilities significant increased energy costs including as a result of new laws such as carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements could be passed along to the company and its customers and suppliers compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by the company or its customers or suppliers 

physical risks associated with climate change may result in an increase of the exposure to and impact of events with damage due to flooding extreme winds and extreme precipitation for howmet locations suppliers or customers prolonged periods of drought may result in wildfires which may have an adverse effect on production capacity of howmet sites suppliers and customers these types of incidents could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

with respect to the various transaction agreements that the company entered into with arconic corporation and with alcoa corporation in connection with its separation transactions if the counterparties fail to meet their obligations under such agreements or if we are required to pay under certain indemnification obligations our business results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 

in connection with the arconic inc separation transaction and the alcoa inc separation transaction we entered into various agreements with arconic corporation and alcoa corporation respectively including separation and distribution agreements tax matters agreements employee matters agreements intellectual property license agreements and metal supply agreements we rely on arconic corporation and alcoa corporation to satisfy their performance and payment obligations under these agreements if either arconic corporation or alcoa corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under its applicable agreements we could incur operational difficulties andor material losses 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement dated as of october 31 2016 and certain other agreements between us and alcoa corporation alcoa corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify alcoa corporation for certain liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement dated as of march 31 2020 and certain other agreements between us and arconic corporation arconic corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify arconic corporation for certain liabilities indemnities that we may be required to provide alcoa corporation and arconic corporation are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that alcoa corporation or arconic corporation as applicable agreed to retain any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the company’s operations further alcoa corporation or arconic corporation as applicable may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from alcoa corporation or arconic corporation as applicable any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear such losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the arconic inc separation transaction could result in substantial tax liability 

it was a condition to the distribution of all outstanding shares of arconic corporation common stock to the company’s stockholders the “distribution of arconic” which effected the arconic inc separation transaction that we receive an opinion of our outside counsel satisfactory to our board of directors regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” this condition was satisfied prior to the distribution of arconic however the opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings by us and arconic corporation including those relating to the past and future conduct by us and arconic corporation if any of these facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if we or arconic corporation breach any of our representations or covenants contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding our receipt of the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that the distribution of arconic andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated in addition the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that i the irs will not assert that the distribution of arconic andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or ii a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we our stockholders and arconic corporation could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution of arconic fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the arconic corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who received such arconic corporation shares in the distribution of arconic would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under current us federal income tax law even if the distribution of arconic together with certain related transactions otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the distribution of arconic may nevertheless be rendered taxable to us as a result of certain postdistribution transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of ours or arconic corporation under the tax matters agreement entered into between us and arconic corporation in connection with the arconic inc separation transaction arconic corporation may be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the arconic inc separation transaction and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of arconic corporation whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii other actions or failures to act by arconic corporation or iii any of arconic corporation’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated however the indemnity from arconic corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities and arconic corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from arconic corporation any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear such losses in addition we and our subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the arconic inc separation transaction including nonus tax costs resulting from transactions including the internal reorganization in nonus jurisdictions which may be material each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

general risks 

antitakeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of howmet including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of howmet’s shareholders 

howmet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with howmet’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover for example howmet is subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire howmet additionally the company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes howmet’s board of directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other antitakeover measures without stockholder approval these provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that howmet’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of howmet’s shareholders these provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of howmet common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes these estimates are based on historical experience and in some cases assumptions based on current and future market experience including considerations relating to the impact of covid19 the impact of covid19 is rapidly changing and of unknown duration and macroeconomic impact and as a result these considerations remain highly uncertain areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include the testing of goodwill other intangible assets and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

goodwill howmet reviews goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business the company has the option to assess impairment through qualitative assessment which includes factors such as general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others howmet can also assess goodwill impairment through a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow “dcf” model to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value assumptions and estimates utilized in the dcf model include weighted average cost of capital “wacc” rates revenue future profitability working capital cash flows and a number of other items for more information on these matters see note a to the consolidated financial statements of this form 10k 

properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments 

during the second quarter of 2019 the company updated its fiveyear strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the disks asset group within the engine products and forgings segment at that time as such the company evaluated the recoverability of the disks asset group longlived assets by comparing the carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows of the disks asset group the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the disks asset group longlived assets were deemed to be impaired the impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the longlived assets with fair value determined using a dcf model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods including an estimate for economic obsolescence the impairment charge of 428 of which 247 and 181 related to the engine products and engineered structures segments respectively which was recorded in the second quarter of 2019 impacted properties plants and equipment intangible assets and certain other noncurrent assets by 198 197 and 33 respectively the impairment charge was recorded in restructuring and other charges in the statement of consolidated operations 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair 

value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality the pension and other postretirement benefits obligation was 2461 and 2928 with a funded status of 930 and 1204 at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the total benefit obligation reduction of 467 was primarily driven by the purchases of annuity contracts and changes in discount rate the improvement in the funded status of 274 was primarily driven by the purchase of annuity contracts changes in discount rates and actual asset returns in excess of expected asset returns excluding settlements and curtailments net periodic benefit cost of pension and other postretirement benefits is expected to be approximately 20 in 2022 compared to 16 and 35 in 2021 and 2020 respectively net periodic benefit costs decreased by 19 or 54 in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of actual asset returns in excess of expected asset returns changes in discount rates and changes in plan administration of prescription drug benefits 

employer contributions for pension benefits were 96 and 227 for the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively benefits paid for other postretirement benefits were 17 for both years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 total pension contributions and other postretirement benefits paid decreased by 131 or 54 in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily driven by the arconic inc separation transaction cash contributions in 2022 are expected to be 44 and represent estimated minimum required pension funding howmet’s funded status under erisa was approximately 76 as of january 1 2021 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities for the us is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary while both the uk and canada utilize models developed by the respective actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking industrials transportation and utilities among others the yield curve models parallel the plans’ projected cash flows which have a global average duration of 11 years the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the models exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2021 2020 and 2019 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 270 240 and 300 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 70 and either a charge or credit of less than 1 to earnings in the following year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns the assumption represents a longterm prospective return management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2021 2020 and 2019  management used 620 600 and 560 respectively as its expected longterm rate of return on plan assets which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class t hese rates were within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class in the current year the actual rate of return on plan assets was 72 the increase in expected longterm rate of return of plan assets compared to prior years is due to an increased portion of plan assets within us plans and corresponding asset allocations for 2022 management anticipates that the expected longterm rate of return for the plan assets will be approximately 600 a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact earnings by approximately 3 for 2022  

in 2021  net income of 181 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the increase in the discount rate plan asset performance that was greater than expected and amortization of actuarial losses in 2020  a net loss of 46 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate partially offset by plan asset performance that was greater than expected and by amortization of actuarial losses after adjusting for the impact of arconic corporations obligation the net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation decreased less than 2 during 2020 in 2019  a net loss of 388 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate which was partially offset by plan asset performance that was greater than expected and by the amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation howmet recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value forfeitures are accounted for as they occur the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model the fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a monte carlo valuation model determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

compensation expense recorded in 2021 2020 and 2019 was 40 36 aftertax 46 42 aftertax and 69 63 aftertax respectively 

income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision benefit for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable based on current year pretax income plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of howmet’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and howmet’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

it is howmet’s policy to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset gilti inclusions under this approach reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment instead future gilti inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets 

it is howmet’s policy to treat taxes due from future inclusions in us taxable income related to gilti as a current period expense when incurred 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized 

litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings these matters may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others if an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable and the amount of the potential loss can be estimated the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed probable but the loss is not reasonably estimable or if an unfavorable outcome is deemed reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed but no liability is recorded legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss

competitive conditions 

the company’s segments  engine products fastening systems engineered structures and forged wheels  are subject to substantial and intense competition in the markets they serve although howmet believes its advanced technology manufacturing processes and experience provide advantages to howmet’s customers such as high quality and superior mechanical properties that meet the company’s customers’ most stringent requirements many of the products howmet makes can be produced by competitors using similar types of manufacturing processes as well as alternative forms of manufacturing despite intense competition howmet continues as a market leader in most of its principal markets several factors including howmet’s technological expertise stateoftheart capabilities engaged employees and longstanding customer relationships enable the company to maintain its competitive position 

principal competitors include berkshire hathaway inc through its 2016 acquisition of precision castparts corporation and subsidiaries for titanium and titaniumbased alloys precision forgings seamless rolled rings investment castings and aerospace fasteners vsmpo russia for titanium and titaniumbased alloys and precision forgings the highperformance materials  components segment of allegheny technologies inc for titanium and titaniumbased alloys precision forgings and investment castings lisi aerospace france for aerospace fasteners and aubert  duval part of eramet group in france for precision forgings other competitors include doncasters group ltd uk and consolidated precision products corp owned by warburg pincus and berkshire partners for investment castings weber metals part of otto fuchs for precision forgings and forgital and frisa mexico for seamless rings

 item 1a risk factors 

howmet’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm the company’s business financial condition or results of operations including causing its actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to howmet or that howmet currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company in future periods 

risks related to our business and operations 

our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

any outbreaks of contagious diseases public health epidemics or pandemics and other adverse public health developments in countries where we our employees customers and suppliers operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows specifically the covid19 pandemic affecting the global community including the united states europe and south america is adversely impacting our operations and the nature and extent of the impact over time is highly uncertain and beyond our control the extent to which covid19 further affects our operations over time will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain including the duration of the pandemic the continued severity of the virus resurgences and emergence of variants of the virus the efficacy and availability of vaccines and the extent of actions that may be taken to contain its impact these actions include but are not limited to declarations of states of emergency business closures manufacturing restrictions and a prolonged period of travel commercial andor other similar restrictions and limitations many of which have been implemented across much of the globe and all of which have negatively affected our business the longer the duration the greater the impact on our business and the more heightened the risk of a continuing material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial conditions andor cash flows as well as on our business strategies and initiatives we continue to monitor guidelines proposed by federal state and local as well as foreign governments with respect to measures for continued operation which may change over time depending on public health safety and other considerations we are continuing to focus on the safety and protection of our workforce by continuing to implement additional safety protocols in light of covid19 

as a result of covid19 and the measures designed to contain its spread our global sales including to customers in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries that are impacted by covid19 have been and are expected to continue to be negatively impacted due to the disruption in demand which has had and over time could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows the covid19 pandemic has subjected our operations financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks including but not limited to those discussed below 

• business and operations risks we continue to monitor the evolving situation relating to covid19 to determine whether we will need to significantly modify our business practices or take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees customers partners suppliers and shareholders we have had a number of smaller manufacturing locations that have experienced periods of shutdowns future shutdowns will be dependent on facts and circumstances as they unfold including based on the restrictions and limitations noted above additional shutdowns while not required by governmental authorities may be necessary to match our production to the reduced demand of our customers in addition due to the foregoing factors and potential further disruptions we may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase we may also face challenges in restoring our production levels if and when covid19 abates including as a result of governmentimposed or other limitations that prevent the return of all or a portion of our workforce continue to disrupt demand andor limit the capabilities of our suppliers as a result of covid19 and its potential impact on the aerospace industry the possibility exists that a sustained impact to our operations financial results and market capitalization may require material impairments of our assets including but not limited to goodwill intangible assets longlived assets and rightofuse assets while we have already implemented plans to reduce costs including certain headcount reductions reductions in certain cash outflows suspension of our common stock dividend and reductions in the levels of our capital expenditures the longerterm impact of the covid19 pandemic is uncertain but could continue to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

• customer and supplier risks  we have limited visibility into future demand due to the disruptions resulting from covid19 the sharp decrease in air travel resulting from the covid19 pandemic and the measures that governments and private organizations worldwide have implemented in an attempt to contain its spread is adversely affecting and will likely continue to adversely affect airlines and airframers and their respective demand for our customers’ products and services aircraft manufacturers are reducing production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and as a result demand for products in the oem market has significantly decreased several of our aerospace and commercial transportation customers temporarily suspended operations at certain production sites 

reduced operations and production rates andor took costcutting actions including but not limited to general electric company raytheon technologies corporation and the boeing company which represented approximately 11 9 and 8 respectively of our thirdparty sales in 2020 due to the foregoing factors and other costcutting measures we are experiencing and expect to continue experiencing lower demand and volume for our products customer requests for potential payment deferrals pricing concessions or other contract modifications and delays in deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones covid19 may also limit the ability of our counterparties generally to perform their obligations to us including but not limited to our customers’ ability to make timely payments to us these trends may lead to charges impairments and other adverse financial impacts over time as noted above as we have historically depended upon the strength of these industries particularly the commercial aerospace industry in addition the ongoing covid19 pandemic may negatively impact customer contract negotiations including the ability to negotiate acceptable terms in contract renewal negotiations and our ability to obtain new customers similarly our suppliers may not have the materials capacity or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications to date we have not experienced significant disruption to our supply chain if our suppliers’ operations were to be impacted we may need to seek alternate suppliers which may be more expensive may not be available or may result in delays in shipments to us and subsequently to our customers each of which would adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows the duration of the current disruptions to our customers and to our supply chain and related financial impact to us cannot be estimated at this time should such disruption continue for an extended period of time the impact will have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition andor cash flows ultimately the demand for our products is in turn driven by demand for transportation and for people to travel within and between various countries should the covid19 pandemic cause a longterm deterioration in demand for transportation or travel due to fear or anxiety related to health concerns governmental restriction economic hardships or increased use of electronic communication technologies embraced during the covid19 related shutdowns the effects on our business may extend well beyond the current covid19 health crisis and immediate related governmental actions 

• market risks  the current financial market dynamics and volatility pose heightened risks to our liquidity for example dramatically lower interest rates and lower expected asset valuations and returns can materially impact the calculation of longterm liabilities such as our pension in addition extreme volatility in financial markets has had and may continue to have adverse impacts on other asset valuations such as the value of the investment portfolios supporting our pension our longterm liabilities are sensitive to numerous factors and assumptions that can move in offsetting directions and should be considered as of the time of a relevant measurement event 

• liquidity and credit risks  we currently have the ability to borrow up to 10 billion under our fiveyear revolving credit agreement the “credit agreement” which was amended in june 2020 a prolonged period of generating lower financial results and cash from operations could adversely affect our financial condition including in respect of satisfying both required and voluntary pension funding requirements could result in potential increases in net debt or reductions in ebitda and could otherwise negatively affect our ability to achieve our strategic objectives if the foregoing or other factors negatively impact our ability to comply with the financial covenant in the credit agreement our ability to draw under the credit agreement would be adversely affected there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades as a result of weaker than anticipated performance of our business or other factors including overall market conditions rating downgrades could further adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins liquidity competitive position and access to capital markets and a significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our business conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding including for receivables securitization or supply chain finance programs used to finance working capital or our ability to refinance certain of our indebtedness which could adversely affect our business financial position results of operations andor cash flows although the us federal and other governments have announced a number of funding programs to support businesses our ability or willingness to access funding under such programs may be limited by regulations or other guidance including eligibility criteria or by further change or uncertainty related to the terms of these programs 

the covid19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks disclosed herein including but not limited to risks related to global economic conditions competition loss of customers costs of supplies manufacturing difficulties and disruptions investment returns our credit profile our credit ratings and interest rates we expect that the longer the period of disruption from covid19 continues the more material the adverse impact will be on our business operations financial performance results of operations andor cash flows in addition the covid19 pandemic may also affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not expect to present significant risks to our business results of operations financial conditions andor cash flows 

the markets for howmet’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

howmet is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals enduse markets howmet sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the aerospace and commercial transportation industries and the demand for its products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond its control 

in particular howmet derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft and spare parts the us and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs demand for commercial aircraft and spare parts is influenced by airline industry profitability trends in airline passenger traffic the state of us regional and world economies the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism health and safety concerns including as a result of the covid19 pandemic environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators the retirement of older aircraft the performance and cost of alternative materials and technological improvements to aircraft the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding however it is also driven by the effects of terrorism a changing global geopolitical environment us foreign policy the retirement of older military aircraft and technological improvements to new engines 

further the demand for howmet’s commercial transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by commercial transportation and automotive manufacturers commercial transportation and automotive sales and production are affected by many factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates labor relations issues fuel prices regulatory requirements government initiatives trade agreements and levels of competition the automotive industry is also sensitive to general economic conditions including credit markets and interest rates and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage vehicle size configuration and features 

howmet is unable to predict the future course of industry variables the strength of the us regional or global economies or the effects of government actions negative economic conditions such as a major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

howmet could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance quality or safety which could adversely affect howmet’s reputation business and financial statements 

the manufacture of many of howmet’s products is a highly exacting and complex process problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols specifications and procedures including those related to quality or safety problems with raw materials supply chain interruptions natural disasters labor unrest and environmental factors such problems could have an adverse impact on the company’s ability to fulfill orders or meet product quality or performance product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls customer penalties contract cancellation and product liability exposure because of approval license and qualification requirements applicable to manufacturers andor their suppliers alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to howmet or its customers accordingly manufacturing problems product defects or other risks associated with our products could result in significant costs to and liability for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages fines or penalties as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships 

a material disruption of howmet’s operations particularly at one or more of its manufacturing facilities could adversely affect howmet’s business 

if howmet’s operations particularly one of its key manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism theft sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons howmet may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to or demand from its customers which could adversely affect howmet’s financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase howmet’s costs and reduce its sales any interruption in production capability could require the company to incur costs for premium freight make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect howmet’s profitability and financial condition furthermore a delivery delay by us due to production interruptions could subject us to liability from customer claims that such delay resulted in losses to the customer howmet maintains property damage insurance that the company believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under howmet’s insurance policies may not offset the lost profits or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect howmet’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

information technology system failures cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of howmet’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

howmet relies on its information technology systems to manage and operate its business process transactions and summarize its operating results howmet’s information technology systems could be subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer network and telecommunications failures computer viruses catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by employees if howmet’s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly the company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and howmet may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations any material disruption in the company’s information technology systems or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems could have an adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

howmet also faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on howmet’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted 

howmet employs a number of measures to protect and defend against cyber attacks including technical security controls data encryption firewalls intrusion prevention systems antivirus software and frequent backups additionally the company conducts regular periodic training of its employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use the company’s systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact howmet’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and could result in the diminution of the value of the company’s investment in research and development 

howmet’s enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from cyber attacks and security breaches howmet also maintains compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cyber attack or security breach 

however a breakdown in existing controls and procedures around the company’s cybersecurity environment may prevent howmet from detecting reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or the market price of its securities 

howmet is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial portion of raw materials essential to our operations and supply chain disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business 

howmet has supply arrangements with a limited number of suppliers for raw materials we maintain annual or longterm contracts for a majority of our supply requirements and for the remainder we depend on spot purchases there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or obtain replacements for any of our longterm contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements or at all 

from time to time increasing demand levels have caused regional supply constraints in the industry and further increases in demand levels could exacerbate these issues such constraints could impact our production or force us to purchase primary metal and other supplies from alternative sources which may not be available in sufficient quantities or on terms that are favorable to us howmet could also have exposure if a key supplier is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis in addition a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key supplier exposes us to the risk of default by the supplier on its contractual agreement and this risk is increased by weak and deteriorating economic conditions on a global regional or industry sector level any of the foregoing supply chain disruptions or those due to capacity constraints trade barriers labor shortages business continuity quality cyber attacks delivery issues or disruptions due to weatherrelated natural disaster or pandemic events could adversely affect howmet’s operations and profitability 

howmet’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost or volatility in the availability of raw materials 

howmet may be adversely affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials including but not limited to nickel titanium aluminum cobalt vanadium and platinum as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials the availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of howmet’s products may be influenced by private or government entities including mergers and acquisitions changes in geopolitical conditions or regulatory requirements such as human rights regulations or environmental regulations labor relations between the producers and their work forces unstable governments in exporting nations export quotas sanctions new or increased import duties countervailing or antidumping duties market forces of supply and demand and inflation in addition from time to time commodity prices may fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions howmet may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s operating results 

howmet could be adversely affected by the loss of key customers or significant changes in the business or financial condition of its customers 

howmet has longterm contracts with a significant number of its customers some of which are subject to renewal renegotiation or repricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions howmet’s failure to successfully renew renegotiate or favorably reprice such agreements or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships could result in a reduction or loss in customer purchase volume or revenue 

additionally a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by howmet could affect howmet’s financial results howmet’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses for example due to the grounding of the 737 max aircraft by regulatory authorities in march 2019 boeing suspended production of the aircraft in january 2020 and resumed lowrate production in may 2020 which has resulted in a reduction in the company’s sales while regulatory authorities in the united states and certain other jurisdictions lifted grounding orders beginning in late 2020 our sales could continue to be negatively affected from the residual impacts of the 737 max grounding 

howmet’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with howmet including to reduce the amount of howmet’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers if howmet’s customers reduce terminate or delay purchases from howmet due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and howmet is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

howmet could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending 

howmet’s products are used in a variety of military applications including military aircraft although many of the programs in which howmet participates extend several years they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations changes in military strategy policy and priorities or reductions in defense spending may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for howmet’s products which could adversely affect howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

howmet may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business or complete projects at the levels projected costs or by the dates targeted 

from time to time howmet may announce future targets or goals for its business including revenue growth cash generation cost savings restructuring plans cost reductions and improvements in profitability future targets and goals reflect the company’s beliefs and assumptions and are based on the company’s then current expectations its perception of historical trends and estimates and projections about the environment economies and markets in which howmet operates as well as other applicable factors as such they are inherently subject to significant business economic competitive and other uncertainties regarding future events including the risks discussed in this report the actual outcome may be materially different failure by the company to achieve the targets or goals at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations or the market price of its securities 

in addition the implementation of howmet’s business strategy may involve the entry into and the execution of complex projects which place significant demands on the company’s management and personnel and may depend on numerous factors beyond the company’s control there can be no assurance that such projects will be completed within budgeted costs on a timely basis or at all whether due to the risks described in this report or other factors the failure to complete a material project as planned or a significant delay in its execution could have an adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

howmet faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i i tem 1 businesscompetitive conditions of this report the markets for howmet’s products are highly competitive howmet’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in our product markets new product offerings new technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace howmet products the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by howmet the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for howmet’s products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting howmet’s competitors or customers could adversely affect howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition howmet may face increased competition due to industry consolidation as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or merged companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of howmet’s business may acquire or form alliances with howmet’s competitors thereby reducing their business with howmet industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers consolidation within howmet’s customer base may result in customers who are better able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect howmet’s profitability moreover if as a result of increased leverage customers require howmet to reduce its pricing such that its gross margins are diminished howmet could decide not to sell certain products to a particular customer or not to sell certain products at all which would decrease howmet’s revenue and could benefit its competitors consolidation within howmet’s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for howmet’s products if a combined entity replaces howmet’s products with those of howmet’s competitors with which it has prior relationships the result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business operating results and financial condition 

howmet may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully 

howmet’s competitive position and future performance depends in part on the company’s ability to 

• identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in howmet’s end markets 

• identify and successfully execute on a strategy to remain an essential and sustainable element of our customers’ supply chains 

• fund develop manufacture and bring innovative new products to market quickly and costeffectively 

• monitor disruptive technologies and understand customers’ and competitors’ abilities to deploy such technologies and 

• achieve sufficient return on investment for new products based on capital expenditures and research and development spending 

howmet is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects including advanced alloy development engineered product design and other advanced manufacturing technologies while howmet intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors including those developing technology to displace howmet’s current products in addition howmet may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages there can be no assurance that any of howmet’s new products development programs or technologies will be commercially adopted or be beneficial to howmet 

howmet’s business depends in part on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations reductions and delays 

howmet is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial general aviation military aircraft and aircraft engine programs many of these contracts contemplate production increases over the next several years if howmet fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations similarly program cancellations reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

product liability product safety personal injury property damage and recall claims and investigations may materially affect howmet’s financial condition and damage its reputation 

the manufacture and sale of our products expose howmet to potential product liability personal injury property damage and related claims these claims may arise from allegations of failure to meet product specifications product design flaws and malfunction of products as well as from misuse of our products use of our products in an unintended unapproved or unrecommended manner or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us new data and information including information about the ways in which howmet’s products are used may lead howmet regulatory authorities government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations or impose restrictions related to the manufacturing or use of howmet’s products 

in the event that a howmet product fails to perform as expected regardless of fault or is used in an unexpected manner and such failure or use results in or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage or other losses howmet may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product in addition if a howmet product is perceived to be defective or unsafe howmet’s sales could decrease its reputation could be adversely impacted and it could be subject to further liability claims moreover events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose howmet to government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions 

there can be no assurance that howmet will be successful in defending any such proceedings or that insurance available to howmet will be sufficient to cover any losses associated with such proceedings an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings or investigations could i have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or profitability ii impose substantial monetary damages andor nonmonetary penalties iii result in additional litigation regulatory investigations or other proceedings involving howmet iv result in loss of customers v require changes to our products or business operations or vi damage howmet’s reputation andor negatively impact the market price of howmet’s common stock even if howmet successfully defends against these types of claims howmet could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims howmet’s management could be required to devote significant time attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims and responding to these investigations and howmet’s reputation could suffer product liability claims and related lawsuits and investigations product recalls and allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

our business may be adversely affected if we fail to comply with government contracting regulations 

we derive a portion of our revenue from sales to us and foreign governments and their respective agencies as a subcontractor of their prime contractors such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation administration and performance failure to comply with these laws regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties termination of contracts forfeiture of profits suspension of payments increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting if our government contracts are terminated if we are suspended from government work or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected our financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected 

howmet’s global operations expose howmet to risks that could adversely affect its business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the market price of its securities 

howmet has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states including europe canada mexico china and japan as a result howmet’s global operations are affected by economic political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which howmet does business as well as us laws regulating international trade including 

• economic and commercial instability risks including those caused by sovereign and private debt default corruption and changes in local government laws regulations and policies such as those related to tariffs sanctions and trade barriers including tariffs imposed by the united states as well as retaliatory tariffs imposed by china or other foreign entities taxation data privacy exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of assets or earnings 

• geopolitical risks such as political instability civil unrest expropriation nationalization of properties by a government imposition of sanctions and renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements 

• war terrorist activities kidnapping of personnel or other dangerous conditions 

• major public health issues such as an outbreak of a pandemic or epidemic such as sudden acute respiratory syndrome avian influenza h7n9 virus coronavirus including covid19 and the ebola virus which could cause disruptions in howmet’s operations workforce supply chain or end markets 

• difficulties enforcing contractual rights and intellectual property including a lack of remedies for misappropriation in certain jurisdictions 

• changes in trade and tax laws that may result in our customers being subjected to increased taxes duties and tariffs and reduce their willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products 

• compliance with antitrust and competition regulations 

• rising labor costs or labor unrest including strikes 

• compliance with foreign labor laws which generally provide for increased notice severance and consultation requirements as compared to us laws 

• aggressive selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by foreign governmental authorities 

• compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act and other antibribery and corruption laws 

• compliance with us laws concerning trade including the international traffic in arms regulations the export administration regulations and the sanctions regulations and embargoes administered by the us department of treasury’s office of foreign assets control 

• imposition of currency controls and 

• adverse tax audit rulings 

although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations the company’s international operations subject howmet to complex and dynamic laws and regulations that in some cases could result in conflict or inconsistency between applicable laws of different jurisdictions andor legal obligations while howmet believes it has adopted appropriate risk management compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the associated risks such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs penalties liabilities or other potential risks such as loss of export privileges or repatriation of assets that may arise from such events 

howmet may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the company’s reputation business and competitive position 

howmet owns important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets the company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining howmet’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the company serves howmet’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to howmet’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents howmet owns or licenses despite its controls and safeguards howmet’s technology may be misappropriated by its employees its competitors or other third parties the pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of howmet intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient further in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of misappropriation of howmet intellectual property increases despite efforts the company undertakes to protect it developments or assertions by or against howmet relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce howmet’s rights sufficiently could adversely affect howmet’s business and competitive position 

howmet may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

howmet’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to howmet the company may experience an unfavorable change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies 

howmet is also subject to a variety of legal and regulatory compliance risks in the united states and abroad in connection with its business and products these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability product testing health and safety environmental matters employment matters required record keeping and record retention compliance with securities laws intellectual property rights government contracts and taxes insurance or commercial matters as well as compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations including those governing import and export antibribery antitrust and competition sales and trading practices human rights and modern slavery sourcing of raw materials thirdparty relationships supply chain operations and the manufacture and sale of products howmet may be a party to litigation in a foreign jurisdiction where geopolitical risks might influence the ultimate outcome of such litigation howmet could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts 

the global and diverse nature of howmet’s operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time while howmet believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows in a particular period litigation and compliance efforts may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note v to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 

unanticipated changes in howmet’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect howmet’s future profitability 

howmet is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect the company’s tax expense and profitability howmet’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures 

corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions in particular on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” was signed into law significantly reforming the us internal revenue code of 1986 as amended during 2018 the internal revenue service the “irs” began a number of guidance projects which serve to both interpret and implement the 2017 act those guidance projects which include both proposed and final treasury regulations continued into 2020 howmet continues to review the ongoing interpretive guidance and evaluate its consequences the ultimate impact of the 2017 act may differ from reported amounts due to among other things changes resulting from such ongoing guidance further we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal the 2017 act or enact alternative legislation by the new presidential administration or congress 

labor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of howmet’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1 business of this report while howmet previously has been successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions howmet may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at howmet’s facilities in the future howmet may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business financial condition or results of operations 

howmet is subject to privacy and data securityprotection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data as well as significant fines for noncompliance compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes which could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s financial condition and results of operations in addition the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the gdpr or other privacy and information security laws as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach could damage the company’s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships 

failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on howmet’s business results 

howmet is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws such as the fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions state and local wage laws the employee retirement income security act and regulations related to safety discrimination organizing whistleblowing classification of employees privacy and severance payments citizenship requirements and healthcare insurance mandates allegations that howmet has violated such laws or regulations could damage the company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees which could have a material adverse impact on howmet’s operations and financial condition 

howmet is exposed to environmental health and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities 

howmet’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including present past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that 

caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which howmet may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates at sites that it may acquire in the future or at thirdparty sites used by howmet its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal compliance with health safety and environmental laws and regulations including remediation obligations may prove to be more challenging and costly than the company anticipates howmet’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs including increased remediation costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the industrial activities conducted at howmet’s facilities present a significant risk of injury or death to our employees customers or third parties that may be on site we have experienced serious injuries in the past notwithstanding the safety protocols practices and precautions we take our operations are subject to regulation by various federal state and local agencies in the united states and regulation by foreign government entities abroad responsible for employee health and safety including the occupational safety and health administration from time to time we have incurred fines for violations of various health and safety standards in addition to industrial activities the global covid19 pandemic will continue to significantly impact the health of our employees and increase the cost of health and safety measures within our operations significant community transmission in the vicinity of our operations is likely to impact the workforce availability due to quarantine and isolation practices social distancing mask use testing and other measures increase costs of operation while we maintain insurance and have in place policies to minimize risks associated with industrial activities and covid19 we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities relating to any injury death or other workers compensation claims these types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or result in negative publicity andor significant reputational harm 

howmet may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives such as capandtrade systems additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases or corporate average fuel economy “cafe” standards in the united states new or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect howmet and its customers and suppliers including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by the company or its customers or suppliers also howmet relies on natural gas electricity fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the company and its customers and suppliers which could also have a negative impact on howmet’s profitability 

physical risk associated with climate change may result in an increase of the exposure and impact of events with damage due to flooding extreme winds and extreme precipitation for howmet locations suppliers or customers prolonged periods of drought may result in wildfires which may have an adverse effect on production capacity of howmet sites suppliers and customers while we maintain insurance coverage these types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to liquidity and capital resources 

a decline in howmet’s financial performance or outlook or a deterioration in its credit profile could negatively impact the company’s access to capital markets its liquidity and its borrowing costs 

howmet has significant capital requirements and depends in part upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic actions a decline in the company’s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors could affect the company’s access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions there can be no assurance that howmet will have access to the global capital market on terms the company finds acceptable limitations on howmet’s ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in the company’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect howmet’s ability to maintain or grow its business which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

a downgrade of howmet’s credit ratings could limit its ability to obtain future financing increase borrowing costs and costs relating to credit facilities adversely affect the market price of howmet securities trigger collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

howmet’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital the major credit rating agencies evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings these ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies operations execution and timeliness of financial reporting these credit ratings are limited in scope and do not address all material risks related to investment in us but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued nonetheless the credit ratings howmet receives impact our borrowing costs 

as well as the terms upon which we will have access to capital failure to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings our liquidity or our competitive position and could also restrict our access to capital markets for information on our credit ratings see liquidity and capital resources in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

there can be no assurance that one or more of the credit rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to howmet’s ratings in the future increased debt levels macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant a downgrade of howmet’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could result in adverse consequences including i adversely impact the market price of howmet securities ii adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by sp or moody’s would subject howmet to higher costs under the credit agreement iii limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all iv result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs v increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities or vi result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from howmet 

limitations on howmet’s ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in howmet’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect howmet’s ability to maintain or grow its business which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

howmet’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures 

howmet requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact howmet’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and returnseeking capital projects over the long term howmet’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions which could adversely affect the longterm value of its business and the company’s position in relation to its competitors 

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could adversely affect howmet’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

howmet’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense howmet records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors howmet calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by howmet to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition howmet is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how howmet’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note h to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities howmet would contribute to the pension plans 

potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act “map21” enacted in 2012 provided temporary relief for employers like howmet who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations in 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa extended the relief provided by map21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map21 in 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 bba 2015 extended the relief period provided by hatfa howmet believes that the relief provided by bba 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status over the next several years due to recent and potential future declines in discount rates however higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the company’s cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 

howmet is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation economic factors and currency controls in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which howmet operates and volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect howmet’s revenue expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies including the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi and japanese yen may affect howmet’s profitability 

in addition a portion of howmet’s indebtedness including borrowings if any under the company’s fiveyear credit facility bears interest at rates equal to the london interbank offering rate “libor” plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of howmet’s outstanding senior unsecured longterm debt accordingly the company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate further libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include changes in the cost of howmet’s variable rate indebtedness 

howmet also faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the company’s ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by howmet’s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while howmet currently has no need and does not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should the company need to do so to fund its operations it may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs howmet currently has operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if the company were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have an adverse effect on howmet’s operating results and financial condition 

dividends and share repurchases fall within the discretion of our board of directors depend on a number of factors and are subject to limits under the company’s credit agreement 

share repurchases and the declaration of dividends fall within the discretion of howmet’s board of directors and the board’s decision regarding such matters depends on many factors including howmet’s financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations covenants associated with certain of the company’s debt obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that the board deems relevant in addition under the company’s amendment to the credit agreement during the period from june 30 2020 through december 31 2021 unless the company ends this period earlier in accordance with the amendment or otherwise common stock dividends and share repurchases are permitted only if no borrowings are outstanding under the credit agreement and are limited to an aggregate amount of 100 million through june 30 2021 with such limit increasing to an aggregate amount of 250 million after june 30 2021 if the consolidated net debt to consolidated ebitda ratio is no greater than 375 to 100 the company suspended dividends in april 2020 to preserve cash and provide flexibility in light of the impact of the covid19 pandemic since june 30 2020 the company has repurchased approximately  73 million of its common stock there can be no assurance that the company will declare dividends or repurchase stock in the future in any particular amounts or at all 

general risks 

failure to attract and retain a highly skilled and diverse global workforce or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect howmet’s operations and competitiveness 

howmet’s global operations require highly skilled personnel with relevant industry and technical experience shortages in certain skills in areas such as engineering manufacturing and technology and other labor market inadequacies have created more competition for talent among us and other companies both within and outside of our industry if the company fails to attract develop and retain a diverse global workforce with the skills and in the locations we need to operate and grow our business our operations could be adversely impacted 

in addition the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company’s growth and business strategy the loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm howmet’s business and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the company’s institutional knowledge base result in loss of technical or other expertise delay or impede the execution of the company’s business plans and erode howmet’s competitiveness 

howmet may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions divestitures and strategic alliances 

howmet has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized acquisitions present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company unanticipated costs and 

liabilities and the ability to realize anticipated benefits such as growth in market share revenue or margins at the levels or in the timeframe expected the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully additionally adverse factors may prevent howmet from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines 

with respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures curtailments and closures howmet may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from customers suppliers unions local or national governments or other stakeholders in addition howmet may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities or businesses including but not limited to if a buyer fails to honor all commitments howmet’s business operations are capital intensive and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges including employee separation costs asset impairment charges and other measures 

in addition howmet has participated in and may continue to participate in strategic alliances joint ventures and other similar arrangements from time to time strategic alliances and joint ventures inherently involve special risks even if howmet holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may have opposing economic or business interests exercise veto rights to block howmet actions take action contrary to howmet’s policies or objectives or as a result of financial or other difficulties be unable to fulfill their obligations 

there can be no assurance that acquisitions growth investments divestitures closures strategic alliances joint ventures or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to howmet whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in costs currency fluctuations geopolitical risks or other factors 

antitakeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of howmet including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of howmet’s shareholders 

howmet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with howmet’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover for example howmet is subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire howmet additionally the company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes howmet’s board of directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other antitakeover measures without stockholder approval these provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that howmet’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of howmet’s shareholders these provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of howmet common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

arconic corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the arconic inc separation transaction 

in connection with the arconic inc separation transaction we entered into a separation and distribution agreement with arconic corporation and also entered into various other agreements including a tax matters agreement an agreement related to the davenport plant an employee matters agreement intellectual property license agreements metal supply agreements and real estate and office leases the separation and distribution agreement the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the company prior to the separation was effected determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between us and arconic corporation following the arconic inc separation transaction for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations we will rely on arconic corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if arconic corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties andor losses 

in connection with the arconic inc separation transaction arconic corporation agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify arconic corporation for certain liabilities if we are required to pay under these indemnities to arconic corporation our financial results could be negatively impacted the arconic corporation indemnity may not be sufficient to hold us harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which arconic corporation is allocated responsibility and arconic corporation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with arconic corporation arconic corporation has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify arconic corporation for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts indemnities that we may be required to provide arconic corporation are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact our business third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that arconic corporation has agreed to retain any amounts we are required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in 

furtherance of the company’s operations further the indemnity from arconic corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities and arconic corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from arconic corporation any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear such losses each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the arconic inc separation transaction could result in substantial tax liability 

it was a condition to the distribution of arconic that we receive an opinion of our outside counsel satisfactory to our board of directors regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a “reorganization” within the meaning of sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” this condition was satisfied prior to the distribution of arconic however the opinion of counsel was based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings by us and arconic corporation including those relating to the past and future conduct by us and arconic corporation if any of these facts assumptions representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if we or arconic corporation breach any of our representations or covenants contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding our receipt of the opinion of counsel the internal revenue service the “irs” could determine that the distribution of arconic andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated in addition the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt of the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that i the irs will not assert that the distribution of arconic andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or ii a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge we our stockholders and arconic corporation could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution of arconic fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes we would recognize taxable gain as if we had sold the arconic corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and our stockholders who received such arconic corporation shares in the distribution of arconic would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under current us federal income tax law even if the distribution of arconic together with certain related transactions otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the distribution of arconic may nevertheless be rendered taxable to us as a result of certain postdistribution transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of ours or arconic corporation under the tax matters agreement entered into between us and arconic corporation in connection with the arconic inc separation transaction arconic corporation may be required to indemnify us for any taxes resulting from the arconic inc separation transaction and any related costs and other damages to the extent such amounts resulted from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of arconic corporation whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether we participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii other actions or failures to act by arconic corporation or iii any of arconic corporation’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in the separation agreement and certain other agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated however the indemnity from arconic corporation may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities and arconic corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from arconic corporation any amounts for which we are held liable we may be temporarily required to bear such losses in addition we and our subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the arconic inc separation transaction including nonus tax costs resulting from transactions including the internal reorganization in nonus jurisdictions which may be material each of these risks could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the alcoa inc separation transaction could result in substantial tax liability 

it was a condition to the distribution of alcoa that i the private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the alcoa inc separation transaction and the distribution of alcoa received by howmet remain valid and be satisfactory to howmet’s board of directors and ii howmet receive an opinion of its outside counsel satisfactory to the board of directors regarding the qualification of the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the distribution of alcoa however the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and 

undertakings of howmet and alcoa corporation including those relating to the past and future conduct of howmet and alcoa corporation if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if howmet or alcoa corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the alcoa inc separation transactionrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding howmet’s receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution of alcoa andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by howmet of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that i the irs will not assert that the distribution of alcoa andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or ii a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge howmet alcoa corporation and howmet shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes howmet would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the alcoa corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and howmet shareholders who received alcoa corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under current us federal income tax law even if the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the distribution of alcoa may nevertheless be rendered taxable to howmet and its shareholders as a result of certain postdistribution of alcoa transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of howmet or alcoa corporation the possibility of rendering the distribution of alcoa taxable as a result of such transactions may limit howmet’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of howmet’s business under the tax matters agreement that howmet entered into with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation may be required to indemnify howmet against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of alcoa corporation whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether alcoa corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii other actions or failures to act by alcoa corporation or iii any of alcoa corporation’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the alcoa inc separation transactionrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated however the indemnity from alcoa corporation may be insufficient to protect howmet against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully moreover even if howmet ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which howmet is held liable howmet may be temporarily required to bear such losses in addition howmet and howmet’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the alcoa inc separation transaction including tax costs resulting from separations in nonus jurisdictions which may be material each of these risks could negatively affect howmet’s business results of operations and financial condition

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes these estimates are based on historical experience and in some cases assumptions based on current and future market experience including considerations relating to the impact of covid19 the impact of covid19 is rapidly changing and of unknown duration and macroeconomic impact and as a result these considerations remain highly uncertain areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include the testing of goodwill other intangible assets and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment howmet had four reporting units engine products fastening systems engineered structures and forged wheels for 2020 

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test 

the company determines annually based on facts and circumstances which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment for those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not a quantitative impairment test will be performed howmet’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the first quarter of 2020 howmets market capitalization declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 over the same period the equity value of our peer group companies and the overall us stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility in addition as a result of the covid19 pandemic and measures designed to contain the spread sales globally to customers in the aerospace and commercial transportation industries impacted by covid19 have been and are expected to be negatively impacted as a result of disruption in demand as a result of these macroeconomic factors we performed a qualitative impairment test to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our 

reporting units is less than its carrying value as a result of this assessment the company performed a quantitative impairment test in the first quarter for the engineered structures reporting unit and concluded that though the margin between the fair value of the reporting unit and carrying value had declined from approximately 60 to approximately 15 it was not impaired consistent with prior practice a discounted cash flow model was used to estimate the current fair value of the reporting unit the significant assumptions and estimates utilized to determine fair value were developed utilizing current market and forecast information reflecting the disruption in demand that has had and is expected to have a negative impact on the company’s global sales in the aerospace industry during the second and third quarters of 2020 there were no indicators of impairment identified for the engineered structures reporting unit 

during the 2020 annual review of goodwill in the fourth quarter management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all four of its reporting units the estimated fair values for each of the four reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by 50 or greater thus there was no goodwill impairment the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2019 and 2018 also indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units 

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill howmet uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including sales growth production costs capital spending and discount rate most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the wacc rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts howmet would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments 

during the second quarter of 2019 the company updated its fiveyear strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the disks asset group within the engine products and forgings segment at that time as such the company evaluated the recoverability of the disks asset group longlived assets by comparing the carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows of the disks asset group the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the disks asset group longlived assets were deemed to be impaired the impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the longlived assets with fair value determined using a dcf model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods including an estimate for economic obsolescence the impairment charge of 428 of which 247 and 181 related to the engine products and engineered structures segments respectively which was recorded in the second quarter of 2019 impacted properties plants and equipment intangible assets and certain other noncurrent assets by 198 197 and 33 respectively the impairment charge was recorded in restructuring and other charges in the statement of consolidated operations 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities for the us is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary while both the uk and canada utilize models 

developed by the respective actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking industrials transportation and utilities among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have a global average duration of 12 years the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2020 2019 and 2018 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 240 300 and 400 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 90 and either a charge or credit of approximately 1 to earnings in the following year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns the assumption represents a longterm prospective return management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2020 2019 and 2018 management used 600 560 and 590 respectively as its expected longterm rate of return on plan assets which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class t hese rates fell within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class for 2021 management anticipates that 600 will be the expected longterm rate of return for the plan assets a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact earnings by approximately 4 for 2021 

in 2020 a net loss of 46 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate partially offset by the plan asset performance that was greater than expected and by amortization of actuarial losses after adjusting for the impact of arconic corporations obligation the net pension and other postretirement benefit obligation decreased less than 2 during 2020 in 2019 a net loss of 388 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate which was partially offset by the plan asset performance that was greater than expected and by the amortization of actuarial losses in 2018 a net loss of 114 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance that permits a reclassification to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as well as the plan asset performance that was less than expected which were partially offset by the increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation howmet recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value forfeitures are accounted for as they occur the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model the fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a monte carlo valuation model determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

compensation expense recorded in 2020 2019 and 2018 was 46 42 aftertax 69 63 aftertax and 40 31 aftertax respectively 

income taxes the provision benefit for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision benefit for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable based on current year pretax income plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of howmet’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and howmet’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance 

existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

the 2017 act created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries global intangible low taxed income gilti must be included in the gross income of the us shareholder in 2018 howmet made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset gilti inclusions under this approach reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment instead future gilti inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

 item 1a risk factors 

arconic’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business financial condition or results of operations including causing arconic’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to arconic or that arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company in future periods 

risks related to our business 

the markets for arconic’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals enduse markets arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the aerospace automotive commercial transportation and building and construction industries and the demand for its products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond its control 

in particular arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft the us and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability trends in airline passenger traffic the state of us regional and world economies the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism health and safety concerns environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators the retirement of older aircraft the performance and cost of alternative materials and technological improvements to aircraft the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding however it is also driven by the effects of terrorism a changing global political environment us foreign policy the retirement of older military aircraft and technological improvements to new engines 

further the demand for arconic’s automotive and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive and commercial transportation manufacturers and volume of aluminum content per vehicle the automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions including credit markets and interest rates and consumer spending and 

preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage vehicle size configuration and features automotive and commercial transportation sales and production can also be affected by other factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates labor relations issues fuel prices regulatory requirements government initiatives trade agreements and levels of competition both within and outside of the aluminum industry 

arconic is unable to predict the future course of industry variables the strength of the us regional or global economies or the effects of government actions negative economic conditions such as a major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1 businesscompetitive conditions of this report the markets for arconic’s products are highly competitive arconic’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets new product offerings new technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace arconic products the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by arconic the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for arconic’s products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting arconic’s competitors or customers could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition arconic may face increased competition due to industry consolidation as companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or merged companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of arconic’s business may acquire or form alliances with arconic’s competitors thereby reducing their business with arconic industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to obtain favorable terms from suppliers or who are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers consolidation within arconic’s customer base may result in customers who are better able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect arconic’s profitability moreover if as a result of increased leverage customers require arconic to reduce its pricing such that its gross margins are diminished arconic could decide not to sell certain products to a particular customer or not to sell certain products at all which would decrease arconic’s revenue consolidation within arconic’s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for arconic’s products a combined entity replacing arconic’s products with those of arconic’s competitors and cancellations of orders the result of these developments could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business operating results and financial condition 

arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers 

arconic has longterm contracts with a significant number of its customers some of which are subject to renewal renegotiation or repricing at periodic intervals or upon changes in competitive supply conditions arconic’s failure to successfully renew renegotiate or favorably reprice such agreements or a material deterioration in or termination of these customer relationships could result in a reduction or loss in customer purchase volume or revenue 

additionally a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer supplied by arconic could affect arconic’s financial results arconic’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses for example in 2019 boeing announced a temporary reduction in the production rate of and subsequently announced a temporary suspension of production of the boeing 737 max aircraft which has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in a reduction in sales of aluminum sheet and plate and other products that arconic produces for boeing airplanes as no firm timeline has been established for either the adjustment of boeing’s manufacturing plans or for returning the aircraft into service we are currently unable to definitively quantify any such potential impact 

arconic’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with arconic including to reduce the amount of arconic’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers if arconic’s customers reduce terminate or delay purchases from arconic due to the foregoing factors or otherwise and arconic is unsuccessful in enforcing its contract rights or replacing such business in whole or in part or replaces it with less profitable business our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 

arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance quality or safety which could affect arconic’s reputation business and financial statements 

the manufacture of many of arconic’s products is a highly exacting and complex process problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols specifications and procedures including those related to quality or safety problems with raw materials supply chain interruptions natural disasters labor unrest and environmental factors such problems could have an adverse impact on the company’s ability to fulfill orders or on product quality or on performance product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls customer penalties contract cancellation and product liability exposure because of approval license and qualification 

requirements applicable to manufacturers andor their suppliers alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to arconic or its customers accordingly manufacturing problems product defects or other risks associated with our products could result in significant costs to and liability for us that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages fines or penalties as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships 

arconic’s business depends in part on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations reductions and delays 

arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial general aviation military aircraft and aircraft engine programs as well as aluminum sheet and extrusions for a number of aluminumintensive automotive vehicle programs many of these programs are scheduled for production increases over the next several years if arconic fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations similarly program cancellations reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business 

product liability product safety personal injury property damage and recall claims and investigations may materially affect arconic’s financial condition and damage arconic’s reputation 

the manufacture and sale of our products exposes arconic to potential product liability personal injury property damage and related claims these claims may arise from failure to meet product specifications design flaws in our products malfunction of our products misuse of our products use of our products in an unintended unapproved or unrecommended manner or use of our products with systems not manufactured or sold by us new data and information including information about the ways in which arconic’s products are used may lead arconic regulatory authorities government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations or impose restrictions related to the manufacturing or use of arconic’s products 

in the event that an arconic product fails to perform as expected regardless of fault or is used in an unexpected manner and such failure or use results in or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage or other losses arconic may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product in addition if an arconic product is perceived to be defective or unsafe sales of arconic’s products could be diminished arconic’s reputation could be adversely impacted and arconic could be subject to further liability claims moreover events that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose arconic to government investigations or regulatory enforcement actions 

there can be no assurance that arconic will be successful in defending any such proceedings or that insurance available to arconic will be sufficient to cover any losses associated with such proceedings an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings or investigations could i have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or profitability ii impose substantial monetary damages andor nonmonetary penalties iii result in additional litigation regulatory investigations or other proceedings involving arconic result in loss of customers iv require changes to our products or business operations or v damage arconic’s reputation andor negatively impact the market price of arconic’s common stock even if arconic successfully defends against these types of claims arconic could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims arconic’s management could be required to devote significant time attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims and responding to these investigations and arconic’s reputation could suffer product liability claims and related lawsuits and investigations product recalls and allegations of product safety or quality issues regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome may have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition and reputation and on our ability to attract and retain customers 

for further discussion of potential liability associated with some of our products including proceedings and investigations relating to the june 13 2017 fire at the grenfell tower in london uk see part i item 3  legal proceedings of this report 

arconic’s global operations expose arconic to risks that could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the market price of its securities 

arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states including europe canada china japan and russia as a result arconic’s global operations are affected by economic political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which arconic does business as well as us laws regulating international trade including 



 although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations the company’s international operations subject arconic to complex and dynamic laws and regulations that in some cases could result in conflict or inconsistency between applicable laws andor legal obligations while arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the associated risks such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs penalties liabilities or other potential risks such as loss of export privileges or repatriation of assets that may arise from such events 

a material disruption of arconic’s operations particularly at one or more of the company’s manufacturing facilities could adversely affect arconic’s business 

if arconic’s operations particularly one of the company’s manufacturing facilities were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures natural disasters power outages fires explosions terrorism theft sabotage adverse weather conditions public health crises labor disputes or other reasons arconic may be unable to effectively meet its obligations to or demand from its customers which could adversely affect arconic’s financial performance 

interruptions in production could increase arconic’s costs and reduce its sales any interruption in production capability could require the company to incur costs for premium freight make substantial capital expenditures or purchase alternative material at higher costs to fill customer orders which could negatively affect arconic’s profitability and financial condition furthermore because customers may be dependent on planned deliveries from us customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our delivery delays may be able to pursue financial claims against us and we may incur costs to correct such problems in addition to any liability resulting from such claims arconic maintains property damage insurance that the company believes to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from significant production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss however any recovery under arconic’s insurance policies may not offset the lost profits or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations which could adversely affect arconic’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

arconic may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business segments or complete projects at the levels projected costs or by the dates targeted 

from time to time arconic may announce future targets or goals for its business which are based on the company’s then current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the operating environment economies and markets in which arconic operates future targets and goals reflect the company’s beliefs and assumptions and its perception of historical trends then current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances as such targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events including the risks discussed in this report the actual outcome may be materially different there can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all failure to achieve the targets or goals by the company may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations or the market price of its securities 

in addition the implementation of arconic’s business strategy periodically involves the entry into and the execution of complex projects which place significant demands on the company’s management and personnel and may depend on numerous factors beyond the company’s control there can be no assurance that such projects will be completed within budgeted costs on a timely basis or at all whether due to the risks described in this report or other factors the failure to complete a material project as planned or a significant delay in a material project whatever the cause could have an adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

information technology system failures cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of arconic’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

arconic relies on its information technology systems to manage and operate its business process transactions and summarize its operating results arconic’s information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages computer network and telecommunications failures computer viruses and catastrophic events such as fires floods earthquakes tornadoes hurricanes acts of war or terrorism and usage errors by employees if arconic’s information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly the company may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and arconic may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in its operations any material disruption in the company’s information technology systems or delays or difficulties in implementing or integrating new systems or enhancing current systems could have an adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic also faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on arconic’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted 

arconic employs a number of measures to protect and defend against cyber attacks including technical security controls data encryption firewalls intrusion prevention systems antivirus software and frequent backups additionally the company conducts regular periodic training of its employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact arconic’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and could result in the diminution of the value of the company’s investment in research and development 

arconic’s enterprise risk management program and disclosure controls and procedures address cybersecurity and include elements intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligations arising from cyber attacks and security breaches arconic also maintains compliance programs to address the potential applicability of restrictions against trading while in possession of material nonpublic information generally and in connection with a cyber attack or security breach 

however a breakdown in existing controls and procedures around the company’s cybersecurity environment may prevent arconic from detecting reporting or responding to cyber incidents in a timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition or the market price of its securities 

arconic may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully 

arconic’s competitive position and future performance depends in part on the company’s ability to 

 arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects including advanced alloy development engineered finishes and product design rolling technology and other advanced manufacturing technologies 

while arconic intends to continue to develop innovative new products and services it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors including those developing technology to displace arconic’s current products in addition arconic may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages there can be no assurance that any of arconic’s new products or services development programs or technologies will be commercially adopted or beneficial to arconic 

arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending 

arconic’s products are used in a variety of military applications including military aircraft and armored vehicles although many of the programs in which arconic participates extend several years they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations changes in military strategy and priorities or reductions in defense spending may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for arconic’s products which could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the company’s reputation business and competitive position 

arconic owns important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets the company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining arconic’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the company serves arconic’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to arconic’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents arconic owns or licenses despite its controls and safeguards arconic’s technology may be misappropriated by its employees its competitors or other third parties the pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of arconic intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient further in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of misappropriation of arconic intellectual property increases despite efforts the company undertakes to protect it developments or assertions by or against arconic relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce arconic’s rights sufficiently could adversely affect arconic’s business and competitive position 

a decline in arconic’s financial performance or outlook or a deterioration in its credit profile could negatively impact the company’s access to capital markets reduce its liquidity and increase its borrowing costs 

arconic has significant capital requirements and depends in part upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic acquisitions a decline in the company’s financial performance or outlook due to internal or external factors could affect the company’s access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions there can be no assurance that arconic will have access to the global capital market on terms the company finds acceptable limitations on arconic’s ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in the company’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect arconic’s ability to maintain or grow its business which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings could limit arconic’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs increase the pricing of its credit facilities adversely affect the market price of its securities 

trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

arconic’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital the major credit rating agencies evaluate our creditworthiness and give us specified credit ratings these ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and financial policies as well as our strategies operations execution and timeliness of financial reporting these credit ratings are limited in scope and do not address all material risks related to investment in us but rather reflect only the view of each rating agency at the time the rating is issued nonetheless the credit ratings arconic receives impact our borrowing costs as well as the terms upon which we will have access to capital failure to maintain sufficiently high credit ratings could adversely affect the interest rate in future financings our liquidity or our competitive position and could also restrict our access to capital markets 

on may 1 2017 standard and poor’s ratings services sp affirmed arconic’s longterm debt at bbb an investment grade rating with a stable outlook and its shortterm debt at a3 on february 7 2019 sp placed the rating on negative credit watch and subsequently on april 26 sp affirmed the longterm debt rating at bbb but changed the outlook to negative on january 28 2020 sp affirmed the longterm debt rating at bbb but changed the outlook to stable in expectation of the separation impact on november 1 2016 moody’s investor service moody’s downgraded arconic’s longterm debt rating from ba1 a noninvestment grade to ba2 with a stable outlook and its shortterm debt rating from speculative grade liquidity1 to speculative grade liquidity2 moody’s ratings and outlooks were affirmed on november 2 2017 october 8 2018 and october 9 2019 on january 24 2020 moody’s affirmed the longterm debt rating at ba2 but changed the outlook to negative on april 21 2016 fitch affirmed arconic’s longterm debt rating at bb a noninvestment grade and shortterm debt at b additionally fitch changed the outlook from positive to evolving on july 7 2016 fitch changed the outlook from evolving to stable ratings and outlook were affirmed on july 3 2017 on september 27 2018 fitch changed the outlook from stable to positive ratings and outlook were affirmed on october 8 2019 

there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to arconic’s ratings in the future increased debt levels macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could i result in adverse consequences including adversely impact the market price of arconic’s securities ii adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by sp or moody’s would subject arconic to higher costs under arconic’s fiveyear revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities iii limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all iv result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs v increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities or vi result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from arconic 

limitations on arconic’s ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in arconic’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect arconic’s ability to maintain or grow its business which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

arconic’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures 

arconic requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact arconic’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and returnseeking capital projects over the long term arconic’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions which could adversely affect the longterm value of its business and the company’s position in relation to its competitors 

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect arconic’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

arconic’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors arconic calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by arconic to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition arconic is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and 

liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how arconic’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimatespension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note f to the consolidated financial statementspension and other postretirement benefits in part ii item 8  financial statements and supplementary data although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities arconic would contribute to the pension plans 

potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act “map21” enacted in 2012 provided temporary relief for employers like arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations in 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law hatfa extended the relief provided by map21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map21 in 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 bba 2015 was signed into law bba 2015 extends the relief period provided by hatfa arconic believes that the relief provided by bba 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status over the next several years due to recent and potential future declines in discount rates however higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of unpredictable future declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the company’s cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans which could adversely affect arconic’s liquidity and results of operations 

unanticipated changes in arconic’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect arconic’s future profitability 

arconic is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect the company’s tax expense and profitability arconic’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures 

corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions in particular on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” was signed into law significantly reforming the united states internal revenue code of 1986 as amended during 2018 the internal revenue service the “irs” began a number of guidance projects which serve to both interpret and implement the 2017 act those guidance projects which include both proposed and final treasury regulations continued in 2019 and may continue in 2020 arconic continues to review the components of the 2017 act as well as the ongoing interpretive guidance and evaluate its consequences as such the ultimate impact of the 2017 act may differ from reported amounts due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made to date and actions the company may take as a result of the 2017 act and related guidance these changes to the us corporate tax system could have a substantial impact positive or negative on arconic’s future effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

arconic may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and strategic alliances 

arconic has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized acquisitions present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company unanticipated costs and liabilities and the ability to realize anticipated benefits such as growth in market share revenue or margins at the levels or in the timeframe expected the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully additionally adverse factors may prevent arconic from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines 

with respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures curtailments and closures arconic may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from customers suppliers unions local or 

national governments or other stakeholders in addition arconic may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities or businesses including but not limited to if a buyer fails to honor all commitments arconic’s business operations are capital intensive and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges including employee separation costs asset impairment charges and other measures 

in addition arconic has participated in and may continue to participate in joint ventures strategic alliances and other similar arrangements from time to time although the company has in connection with past and existing joint ventures sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks whether or not arconic holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 there can be no assurance that acquisitions growth investments divestitures closures joint ventures strategic alliances or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to arconic whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

arconic’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum 

arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminumbased products the price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable although the company’s pricing of products is generally intended to pass substantially all the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the company’s customers or is otherwise hedged there are situations where arconic is unable to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there is a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the company can implement a corresponding increase in price to its customers andor there are other timing factors that may result in arconics exposure to certain price fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations further since metal prices fluctuate among the various exchanges arconic competitors may enjoy a metal price advantage from time to time 

arconic may be adversely affected by changes in the availability or cost of other raw materials including but not limited to cobalt nickel titanium sponge vanadium copper magnesium and zinc as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials the availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of arconic’s products may be influenced by private or government entities including mergers and acquisitions changes in world politics or regulatory requirements such as human rights regulations or environmental regulations labor relations between the producers and their work forces unstable governments in exporting nations export quotas sanctions new or increased import duties countervailing or antidumping duties market forces of supply and demand and inflation in addition from time to time commodity prices may fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions arconic may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s operating results 

arconic is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for a substantial portion of our aluminum and certain other raw materials essential to our operations 

arconic has supply arrangements with a limited number of suppliers for aluminum and other raw materials we maintain annual or longterm contracts for a majority of our supply requirements and for the remainder we depend on spot purchases from time to time increasing demand levels have caused regional supply constraints in the industry and further increases in demand levels could exacerbate these issues such constraints could impact our production or force us to purchase primary metal and other supplies from alternative sources which may not be available in sufficient quantities or may only be available on terms that are less favorable to us further there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or obtain replacements for any of our longterm contracts when they expire on terms that are as favorable as our existing agreements or at all additionally arconic could have exposure if a key supplier in a particular region is unable to deliver sufficient quantities of a necessary material on a timely basis in addition a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of our significant suppliers exposes us to the risk of default by the supplier on our contractual agreements and this risk is increased by weak and deteriorating economic conditions on a global regional or industry sector level 

arconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation economic factors and currency controls in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which arconic operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect arconic’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies including the euro british pound canadian dollar chinese yuan renminbi japanese yen and russian ruble may affect arconic’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies while the company’s products are generally sold in us dollars 

in addition a portion of arconic’s indebtedness including certain borrowings under the company’s fiveyear credit facility bears interest at rates equal to the london interbank offering rate “libor” plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured longterm debt accordingly the company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate further libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include changes in the cost of arconic’s variable rate indebtedness 

arconic also faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the company’s ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by arconic’s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while arconic currently has no need and does not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should the company need to do so to fund its operations it may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs arconic currently has substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if the company were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have an adverse effect on arconic’s operating results and financial condition 

arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

arconic has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including deployment of companywide business process models such as arconic’s degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings and operating cost reductions there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized if arconic fails to achieve net cost savings at anticipated levels its business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

arconic’s customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials 

certain applications of arconic’s aluminumbased products compete with products made from other materials such as steel titanium and composites the willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum often depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes for example the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum such as titanium and composites in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft additionally the automotive industry while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of aluminum may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications further the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices or compatibility of aluminum with other materials used by a customer in a given application the willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for certain of arconic’s products and thus adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

labor disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of arconic’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1  business of this report while arconic previously has been successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at arconic’s facilities in the future arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a failure to attract retain or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect arconic’s operations and competitiveness 

arconic’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company to attract and retain such people may adversely impact arconic’s ability to meet project demands adequately and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering manufacturing technology construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

in addition the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company’s growth and business strategy the loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm arconic’s business and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the company’s institutional knowledge base result in loss of technical or other expertise delay or impede the execution of the company’s business plans and erode arconic’s competitiveness 

arconic may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to arconic the company may experience an unfavorable change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies

the global and diverse nature of arconic’s operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time while arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows in a particular period litigation and compliance efforts may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company including proceedings and investigations relating to the june 13 2017 fire at the grenfell tower in london uk see the discussion in part i item 3  legal proceedings of this report and in note t to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

arconic is exposed to environmental and safety risks and is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations which may result in substantial costs and liabilities 

arconic’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including present past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which arconic may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites at sites owned or operated by its predecessors or affiliates at sites that it may acquire in the future or at thirdparty sites used by arconic its predecessors or affiliates for material and waste handling and disposal compliance with health safety and environmental laws and regulations including remediation obligations may prove to be 

more challenging and costly than the company anticipates arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs including increased remediation costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

in addition the industrial activities conducted at arconic’s facilities present a significant risk of injury or death to our employees customers or third parties that may be on site we have experienced serious injuries in the past notwithstanding the safety protocols practices and precautions we take our operations are subject to regulation by various federal state and local agencies in the united states and regulation by foreign government entities abroad responsible for employee health and safety including the occupational safety and health administration from time to time we have incurred fines for violations of various health and safety standards while we maintain insurance and have in place policies to minimize such risks we may nevertheless be unable to avoid material liabilities for any injury or death that may occur in the future these types of incidents may not be covered by or may exceed our insurance coverage and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition or result in negative publicity andor significant reputational harm 

arconic is subject to privacy and data securityprotection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements for example the european union’s general data protection regulation “gdpr” which became effective in may 2018 imposed significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data as well as significant fines for noncompliance compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes which could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s financial condition and results of operations in addition the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the gdpr or other privacy and information security laws as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach could damage the company’s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships 

failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business results 

arconic is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws such as the fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions state and local wage laws the employee retirement income security act and regulations related to safety discrimination organizing whistleblowing classification of employees privacy and severance payments citizenship requirements and healthcare insurance mandates allegations that arconic has violated such laws or regulations could damage the company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees which could have a material adverse impact on arconic’s operations and financial condition 

arconic may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives such as capandtrade systems additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases or corporate average fuel economy cafe standards in the united states new or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect arconic and its customers and suppliers including by increasing the costs of production or impacting demand for certain products which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by the company or its customers or suppliers also arconic relies on natural gas electricity fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the company and its customers and suppliers which could also have a negative impact on arconic’s profitability 

changes in the united kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the european union could adversely affect arconic 

in march 2017 the united kingdom formally triggered the process to withdraw from the european union also referred to as brexit following the results of a national referendum that took place in june 2016 the united kingdom formally left the european union on january 31 2020 a transition period through december 31 2020 has been established to allow the united kingdom and the european union to negotiate the terms of the united kingdom’s withdrawal however there is continued uncertainty surrounding the future relationship between the united kingdom and the european union including trade agreements between the united kingdom and the european union 

the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic are difficult to predict but because the company currently operates and conducts business in the united kingdom and in europe brexit could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to arconic’s businesses 

including affecting the business of andor our relationships with arconic’s customers and suppliers as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies including the value of the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect arconic’s financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the united kingdom and the european union are established the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the united kingdom and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during the transition period or more permanently 

dividends on arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in business conditions or in other circumstances 

arconic has historically paid dividends on its common stock however it has no obligation to do so the existence timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to arconic’s stockholders falls within the discretion of arconic’s board of directors and the company’s dividend policy may change at any time without advance notice to arconic’s stockholders for example on february 8 2019 in connection with the company’s ongoing strategic and portfolio review arconic announced that it expected to reduce its quarterly common stock dividend from 006 to 002 per share the arconic board of directors’ decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as arconic’s financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations covenants associated with certain of the company’s debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that arconic’s board of directors deems relevant arconic’s board of directors may determine to further reduce or eliminate arconic’s common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions or in other circumstances 

antitakeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of arconic including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of arconic’s shareholders 

arconic’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with arconic’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover for example arconic is subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire arconic additionally the company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes arconic’s board of directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other antitakeover measures without shareholder approval these provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that arconic’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of arconic’s shareholders these provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of arconic common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

risks related to the separation of alcoa 

the separation of alcoa could result in substantial tax liability 

it was a condition to the distribution of alcoa that i the private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation of alcoa and the distribution of alcoa received by arconic remain valid and be satisfactory to arconic’s board of directors and ii arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel satisfactory to the board of directors regarding the qualification of the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the distribution of alcoa however the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of arconic and alcoa corporation including those relating to the past and future conduct of arconic and alcoa corporation if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if arconic or alcoa corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the separation of alcoarelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding arconic’s receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution of alcoa andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the 

conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by arconic of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution of alcoa andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge arconic alcoa corporation and arconic shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the alcoa corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and arconic shareholders who received alcoa corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under current us federal income tax law even if the distribution of alcoa together with certain related transactions otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the distribution of alcoa may nevertheless be rendered taxable to arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain postdistribution of alcoa transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of arconic or alcoa corporation the possibility of rendering the distribution of alcoa taxable as a result of such transactions may limit arconic’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of arconic’s business under the tax matters agreement that arconic entered into with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation may be required to indemnify arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of alcoa corporation whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether alcoa corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds iii repurchasing shares of alcoa corporation stock other than in certain openmarket transactions iv ceasing actively to conduct certain of its businesses v other actions or failures to act by alcoa corporation or vi any of alcoa corporation’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separation of alcoarelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated however the indemnity from alcoa corporation may be insufficient to protect arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully moreover even if arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which arconic is held liable arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses in addition arconic and arconic’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation of alcoa including tax costs resulting from separations in nonus jurisdictions which may be material each of these risks could negatively affect arconic’s business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to the separation of arconic 

the separation of arconic involves significant time and expense which could disrupt or adversely affect arconic’s business may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timelines or at all 

on february 8 2019 arconic announced plans to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies composed of the engineered products and forgings businesses on the one hand and the global rolled products businesses on the other hand  the separation of arconic will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions including among others receipt of a tax opinion from external counsel 

arconic expects that the process of completing the separation of arconic will be timeconsuming and involve significant costs and expenses which may be significantly higher than what it currently anticipates and may not yield a benefit if the separation of arconic is not completed executing the separation of arconic will also require significant time and attention from arconic’s senior management and employees which could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and adversely affect financial results and results of operations arconic may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees or maintaining or initiating relationships with lead suppliers customers and other parties with which arconic currently does business or may do business in the future during the pendency of the separation of arconic and following its completion which could have a material and adverse effect on arconic’s businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects or the businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects of the independent companies resulting from the separation of arconic and although we intend for the separation transactions to be taxfree to the company’s shareholders for us federal income tax purposes there can be no assurance that separation of arconic will so qualify if the separation of arconic were ultimately determined to be taxable we the company’s shareholders andor the new independent company would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant 

arconic may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits from the separation of arconic for example as independent companies the engineered products  forgings and global rolled products businesses will be smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions such as changes in industry conditions which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows working capital 

and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business financial condition and results of operations moreover following the separation of arconic there can be no assurance that either company will be able to obtain an investment grade rating from nationally recognized credit rating agencies which could among other things increase the noninvestment grade rated company’s cost of capital further there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of arconic’s common stock would have been had the proposed separation of arconic not occurred 

additionally the separation is subject to market regulatory and certain other conditions unanticipated developments including among others failure of the separation of arconic to qualify for the expected tax treatment the possibility that any thirdparty consents required in connection with the separation of arconic will not be received material adverse changes in business or industry conditions and changes in global economic and financial market conditions generally could delay or prevent the completion of the separation of arconic or cause the separation of arconic to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected

in march 2019 the supreme court of spain accepted the company’s petition to review the national court’s decision and the company has filed a formal appeal of the assessment the supreme court is reviewing the assessment on its merits and will render a final decision in the event the company receives an unfavorable ruling from the supreme court of spain a portion of the assessment may be offset with existing net operating losses and tax credits available to the spanish consolidated tax group which would be shared between the company and alcoa corporation as provided for in the tax matters agreement

thirdparty sales for this segment increased 683  or 10  in 2018 compared with 2017  primarily attributable to higher aluminum prices higher volumes in the automotive commercial transportation and industrial end markets and favorable product mix partially offset by the absence of sales of 54 from the rolling mill in fusina italy and the planned ramp down of arconics north american packaging operations 

segment operating profit for the global rolled products segment increased 144  or 30  in 2019 compared with 2018  due to favorable pricing adjustments on industrial and commercial transportation products favorable aluminum price impacts net cost savings favorable product mix and the impact of a charge incurred in 2018 related to a physical inventory adjustment at one plant that did not recur in 2019 partially offset by operational challenges at one aluminum extrusions plant and the impact of the tennessee plant transition to industrial production

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters the testing of goodwill other intangible assets and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future sales are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for 2019 arconic had seven reporting units of which four were included in the epf segment fastening systems engineered structures engine products and forged wheels and three were included in the grp segment global rolled products aluminum extrusions and bcs 

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment 

review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test 

arconic determines annually based on facts and circumstances which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment for those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not a quantitative impairment test will be performed arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2019 annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all seven of its reporting units the estimated fair values for each of the seven reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 50 thus there was no goodwill impairment under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill arconic uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including sales growth volumes and pricing production costs capital spending and discount rate most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the wacc rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

in the first quarter of 2019 management transferred its aluminum extrusions business aluminum extrusions from engineered structures within the epf segment to the grp segment based on synergies with the grp segment including similar customer base technologies and manufacturing capabilities management assessed and concluded that the remaining engineered structures business unit and the aluminum extrusions business unit represent reporting units as a result of the reorganization goodwill of 110 was reallocated from engineered structures to aluminum extrusions and these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2019 the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value thus there was no goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2019 management transferred its castings operations from engineered structures to engine products within the epf segment based on process expertise for investment castings that existed within engine products as a result goodwill of 105 was reallocated from engineered structures to engine products and these reporting units were evaluated for impairment during the second quarter of 2019 the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying value thus there was no impairment as a result of the elimination of the tcs segment in the third quarter of 2019 see segment information above the company transferred 7 of forged wheels goodwill and 68 of bcs goodwill from the tcs segment to the epf and grp segments respectively both forged wheels and bcs are considered reporting units 

in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the decline in the forecasted financial performance and related impairment of longlived assets of the disks asset group within engine products the company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for engine products the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value thus there was no impairment of goodwill 

in connection with the interim impairment evaluation of longlived assets for the disks asset group within engine products in the second quarter of 2018 which resulted from a decline in forecasted financial performance for the business in connection with its updated threeyear strategic plan the company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for engine products the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of the carrying value thus there was no impairment of goodwill 

goodwill impairment tests in 2018 and 2017 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units except for the afe business the afe operations were realigned and transferred to aluminum extrusions and engine products whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value as such arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the afe reporting unit of 719 in 2017 the decrease in fair value of afe was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the riskfree rate of return while the carrying value increased compared to prior year 

properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments 

during the second quarter of 2019 the company updated its fiveyear strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the disks asset group within the epf segment as such the company evaluated the recoverability of the disks asset group longlived assets by comparing the carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows of the disks asset group the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows and therefore the disks asset group longlived assets were deemed to be impaired the impairment charge was measured as the amount of carrying value in excess of fair value of the longlived assets with fair value determined using a dcf model and a combination of sales comparison and cost approach valuation methods including an estimate for economic obsolescence the impairment charge of  428 recorded in the second quarter of 2019 impacted properties plants and equipment intangible assets and certain other noncurrent assets by  198   197  and  33  respectively the impairment charge was recorded in restructuring and other charges in the statement of consolidated operations 

during the second quarter of 2018 the company updated its threeyear strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the disks asset group within the epf segment as such the company evaluated the recoverability of the longlived assets by comparing their carrying value of approximately 515 to the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the disks asset group resulting in an estimated fair value in excess of their carrying value of approximately 13  thus there was no impairment 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking industrials transportation and utilities among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2019  2018  and 2017  the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 330  435  and 375  respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 220 and either a charge or credit of approximately 1 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns the assumption represents a longterm prospective return management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2019  2018  and 2017  management used 700  700  and 775  respectively as its expected longterm rate of return which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class these rates fell within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future 

return developed by asset class for 2020  management anticipates that 700 will be the expected longterm rate of return the decrease of 75 basis points in the 2018 expected longterm rate of return was due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20year moving average a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 9 for 2020  

in 2019 a net loss of 388 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 105 basis points which was partially offset by the plan asset performance that was greater than expected and by the amortization of actuarial losses in 2018 a net loss of 114 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance that permits a reclassification to retained earnings accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as well as the plan asset performance that was less than expected which were partially offset by the increase in the discount rate of 60 basis points and the amortization of actuarial losses in 2017 a net loss of 220 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 45 basis points and plan asset performance less than expected which were partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value forfeitures are accounted for as they occur the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model the fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a monte carlo valuation model determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

compensation expense recorded in 2019  2018  and 2017 was 78  70 aftertax 50  39 aftertax and 54  36 aftertax respectively 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

the 2017 act created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries global intangible low taxed income gilti must be included in the gross income of the us shareholder the 2017 act also established the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat until regulations are finalized judgement will be required to apply preliminary guidance including proposed regulations to arconic’s facts and circumstances 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and arconic’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

in 2018 arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset gilti income inclusions under this approach reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment instead future gilti inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are 

recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

competitive conditions 

engineered products and solutions eps 

ep  s’s business units  afs aen and aes are subject to substantial and intense competition in the markets they serve although arconic believes its advanced technology manufacturing processes and experience provide advantages to arconic’s customers such as high quality and superior mechanical properties that meet the company’s customers’ most stringent requirements many of the products arconic makes can be produced by competitors using similar types of manufacturing 

processes as well as alternative forms of manufacturing despite intense competition arconic continues as a market leader in most of its principal markets several factors including arconic’s legacy of technical innovation stateoftheart capabilities engaged employees and longstanding customer relationships enable the company to maintain its competitive position 

principal competitors in the eps segment include berkshire hathaway inc through its acquisition of precision castparts corporation and subsidiaries for titanium and titaniumbased alloys precision forgings seamless rolled rings investment castings and aerospace fasteners vsmpo russia for titanium and titaniumbased alloys and precision forgings the highperformance materials  components segment of allegheny technologies inc ati for titanium and titaniumbased alloys precision forgings and investment castings lisi aerospace france for aerospace fasteners and aubert  duval part of eramet group in france for precision forgings 

other competitors include 

 several of arconic’s largest customers have captive superalloy furnaces for producing airfoil investment castings for their own use many other companies around the world also produce superalloy investment castings and some of these companies currently compete with arconic in the aerospace and other markets while others are capable of competing with the company should they choose to do so 

international competition in the investment castings  fasteners rings and forgings markets may also increase in the future as a result of strategic alliances among engine original equipment manufacturers oems aerostructure prime contractors and overseas companies especially in developing markets particularly where “offset” or “local content” requirements create purchase obligations with respect to products manufactured in or directed to a particular country 

global rolled products grp 

grp is one of the leaders in many of the aluminum flat rolled products markets in which it participates including aerospace automotive commercial transportation industrial markets including brazing sheet and packaging however much like other arconic businesses grp is subject to substantial and intense competition in all of its markets 

while grp participates in markets where arconic believes the company has a significant competitive advantage due to customer intimacy advanced manufacturing capability unique technology andor differentiated products in certain cases the company’s competitors are capable of making products similar to arconic’s the company continuously works to maintain and enhance its competitive advantage through innovation new alloys such as aerospace alloys differentiated products such as the company’s 5layer brazing products and breakthrough processes such as arconic micromill® technology 

some of grp’s markets are worldwide and some are more regionally focused participation in these segments by grp’s competitors varies for example novelis is the largest flat rolled products producer competing in automotive but it does not participate in the aerospace market on the other hand constellium participates in all major market segments including aerospace brazing industrial commercial transportation and packaging granges participates only in the brazing sheet market other grp competitors include aleris amag hydro kaiser kobe nanshan and uacj the competitive landscape is changing  in this past year novelis announced the acquisition of aluminum rolled products producer aleris and braidy industries announced its intention to build a new aluminum mill near ashland kentucky for automotive production 

additionally there are a number of new competitors emerging particularly in china and other developing economies arconic expects that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs the company continually monitors and plans for these new emerging players

 item 1a risk factors 

arconic’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business financial condition or results of operations including causing arconic’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to arconic or that arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company in future periods 

the markets for arconic’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals enduse markets arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the aerospace automotive and commercial transportation and construction industries and the demand for its products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond its control 

in particular arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft the us and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability trends in airline passenger traffic the state of us regional and world economies the ability of 

aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism health and safety concerns environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding however it is also driven by the effects of terrorism a changing global political environment us foreign policy the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines 

further the demand for arconic’s automotive and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive manufacturers and arconic content per vehicle the automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions including credit markets and interest rates and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage vehicle size configuration and features automotive sales and production can also be affected by other factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates labor relations issues fuel prices regulatory requirements government initiatives trade agreements and levels of competition 

while arconic believes that the longterm prospects for its products are positive the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables the strength of the us regional or global economies or the effects of government intervention negative economic conditions such as a major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1  businesscompetitive conditions of this report the markets for arconic’s products are highly competitive arconic’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets new product offerings new technologies in the marketplace or new facilities may compete with or replace arconic products the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by arconic the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for arconic’s products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting arconic’s competitors or customers could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition arconic may face increased competition due to industry consolidation as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their market positions in an evolving industry companies could be acquired or may be unable to continue operations companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of arconic’s business may acquire or form alliances with arconic’s competitors thereby reducing their business with arconic industry consolidation may result in stronger competitors who are better able to compete as solesource vendors for customers if there is consolidation among arconic’s customer base those customers may be able to command increased leverage in negotiating prices and other terms of sale which could adversely affect arconic’s profitability moreover if as a result of increased leverage customer pressures require arconic to reduce its pricing such that its gross margins are diminished the company could decide not to sell certain products under such less favorable terms which would decrease arconic’s revenue consolidation among the company’s customer base may also lead to reduced demand for arconic’s solutions replacement of arconic products by the combined entity with those of arconic’s competitors and cancellations of orders each of which could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business operating results and financial condition 

arconic may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully 

arconic’s competitive position and future performance depends in part on the company’s ability to 

 arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments including additive manufacturing alloy development engineered finishes and product design high speed continuous casting and rolling technology and other advanced manufacturing technologies for more information on arconic’s research and development programs see “research and development” in part i item 1  businessresearch and development of this report 

while arconic intends to continue committing substantial financial resources and effort to the development of innovative new products and services it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors including those developing technology to displace arconic’s current products in addition arconic may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages there can be no assurance that any of arconic’s new products or services development programs or technologies will be commercially adopted or beneficial to arconic 

arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer or customers supplied by arconic could affect arconic’s financial results in a particular period arconic’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses arconic’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with arconic including to reduce the amount of arconic’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers if arconic is unsuccessful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance quality or safety which could affect arconic’s reputation business and financial statements 

the manufacture of many of arconic’s products is a highly exacting and complex process problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols specifications and procedures including those related to quality or safety problems with raw materials supply chain interruptions natural disasters labor unrest and environmental factors such problems could have an adverse impact on the company’s ability to fulfill orders or on product quality or performance product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls customer penalties contract cancellation and product liability exposure including if any of our products are noncompliant or are used in an unintended andor unapproved manner that results in injuries or other damages because of approval and license requirements applicable to manufacturers andor their suppliers alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to the company or its customers accordingly manufacturing problems product defects or other risks associated with our products including their use or application could result in significant costs to and liability for arconic that could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages fines or penalties as well as negative publicity and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships 

arconic’s business depends in part on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations reductions and delays 

arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial general aviation military aircraft and aircraft engine programs and is the sole supplier of aluminum sheet for a number of aluminumintensive automotive vehicle programs many of these programs are scheduled for production increases over the next several years if arconic fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations similarly program cancellations reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business 

arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending 

arconic’s products are used in a variety of military applications including military aircraft and armored vehicles although many of the programs in which arconic participates extend several years they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations changes in military strategy and priorities or reductions in defense spending may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for arconic’s products which could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic’s global operations and status as a public company expose the company to risks that could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition results of operations cash flows or the market price of its securities 

arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states including europe brazil canada china japan and russia as a result the company’s global operations are affected by economic political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which arconic does business as well as us laws regulating international trade including 



 although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations while arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the risks associated with these factors such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs or liabilities that may arise from such events

on february 8 2019 arconic announced plans to separate into engineered products  forgings and global rolled products with a spinoff of one of the businesses and to consider the possible sales of certain businesses 

arconic expects that the process of completing the proposed separation and possible sales of businesses will be timeconsuming and involve significant costs and expenses which may be significantly higher than what it currently anticipates and may not yield a benefit if the separation andor sales are not completed executing these transactions will also require significant time and attention from arconic’s senior management and employees which could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and adversely affect financial results and results of operations arconic may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees or maintaining or initiating relationships with lead suppliers customers and other parties with which arconic currently does business or may do business in the future during the pendency of the separation andor possible sales of businesses and following their completion which could have a material and adverse effect on arconic’s businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects or the businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects of the independent companies resulting from the separation 

arconic may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits from the separation andor possible sales of businesses for example as independent companies the engineered products  forgings and global rolled products businesses will be smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions such as changes in industry conditions which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows working capital and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business financial condition and results of operations moreover following the separation there can be no assurance that either company will be able to obtain an investment grade rating from nationally recognized credit rating agencies which could among other things increase the noninvestment grade rated company’s cost of capital further there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of arconic’s common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred in addition if arconic pursues the possible sales of businesses it may face barriers to exit or objections from various stakeholders andor may retain liabilities for divested entities there can be no assurance that any such sales will be undertaken or completed or that they will be beneficial to arconic whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations political risks or other factors

systems or enhancing current systems could have an adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic also faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on arconic’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted 

arconic employs a number of measures to protect and defend against cyber attacks including technical security controls data encryption firewalls intrusion prevention systems antivirus software and frequent backups additionally the company conducts regular periodic training of its employees regarding the protection of sensitive information which includes training intended to prevent the success of “phishing” attacks while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact arconic’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and result in the diminution of the value of the company’s investment in research and development

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings could limit arconic’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs increase the pricing of its credit facilities adversely affect the market price of its securities trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

arconic’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate arconic’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to the company this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting on may 1 2017 standard and poor’s ratings services sp affirmed arconic’s longterm debt at bbb an investment grade rating with a stable outlook and its shortterm debt at a3 on february 7 2019 sp changed the outlook from stable to negative credit watch on october 8 2018 moody’s investor service moody’s affirmed arconic’s longterm debt rating at ba2 a noninvestment grade with a stable outlook and its shortterm debt rating at speculative grade liquidity2 on september 27 2018 fitch affirmed arconic’s longterm debt rating at bb a noninvestment grade and shortterm debt at b additionally fitch changed the outlook from stable to positive 

there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to arconic’s ratings increased debt levels macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics 

a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of arconic’s securities adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by sp or moody’s would subject arconic to higher costs under arconic’s fiveyear revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from arconic or otherwise impair arconic’s business financial condition liquidity and results of operations 

arconic’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect arconic’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

arconic’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors arconic calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by arconic to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition arconic is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how arconic’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimatespension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7  management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note g  to the consolidated financial statementspension and other postretirement benefits in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities arconic would contribute to the pension plans 

potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act “map21” enacted in 2012 provided temporary relief for employers like arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations in 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law hatfa extended the relief provided by map21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map21 in 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 bba 2015 was signed into law bba 2015 extends the relief period provided by hafta arconic believes that the relief provided by bba 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years however higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the company’s cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans which could adversely affect arconic’s liquidity and results of operations 

unanticipated changes in arconic’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect arconic’s future profitability 

arconic is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive 

effect could affect the company’s tax expense and profitability arconic’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures 

corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions in particular on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” was signed into law significantly reforming the united states internal revenue code of 1986 as amended during 2018 the internal revenue service began a number of guidance projects which serve to both interpret and implement the 2017 act those guidance projects which include both proposed and final treasury regulations will continue into 2019 the company continues to review the components of the 2017 act as well as the ongoing interpretive guidance and evaluate its consequences as such the ultimate impact of the 2017 act may differ from reported amounts due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made to date and actions the company may take as a result of the 2017 act and related guidance these changes to the us corporate tax system could have a substantial impact positive or negative on arconic’s future effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

arconic’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum 

arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminumbased products the price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable although the company’s pricing of products is generally intended to pass the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the company’s customers or is otherwise hedged there are situations where arconic is unable to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there is a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the company can implement a corresponding increase in price to its customers andor there are other timing factors that may result in arconics exposure to certain price fluctuations which could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation economic factors and currency controls in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which arconic operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect arconic’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies including the euro british pound chinese yuan renminbi and russian ruble may affect arconic’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies while the company’s products are generally sold in us dollars 

in addition a portion of arconic’s indebtedness including certain borrowings under the company’s fiveyear credit facility bears interest at rates equal to the london interbank offering rate libor plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of arconic’s outstanding senior unsecured longterm debt accordingly the company is subject to risk from changes in interest rates on the variable component of the rate further libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms and other pressures may cause libor to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted but could include changes in the cost of arconic’s variable rate indebtedness 

arconic also faces risks arising from the imposition of cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls cash repatriation restrictions and exchange controls may limit the company’s ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by arconic’s foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing restrictions or controls while arconic currently has no need and does not intend to repatriate or convert cash held in countries that have significant restrictions or controls in place should the company need to do so to fund its operations it may be unable to repatriate or convert such cash or be unable to do so without incurring substantial costs arconic currently has substantial operations in countries that have cash repatriation restrictions or exchange controls in place including china and if the company were to need to repatriate or convert such cash these controls and restrictions may have an adverse effect on arconic’s operating results and financial condition 

arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

arconic has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including deployment of companywide business process models such as arconic’s degrees of 

implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings and operating cost reductions including among others those announced on february 8 2019 in connection with the company’s ongoing strategic and portfolio review there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized if arconic fails to achieve net cost savings at anticipated levels its business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

arconic’s customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials 

certain applications of arconic’s aluminumbased products compete with products made from other materials such as steel titanium and composites the willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes for example the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum such as titanium and composites in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft additionally the automotive industry while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of aluminum may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications further the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices the willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for certain of arconic’s products and thus adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic’s profitability could be adversely affected by volatility in the availability or cost of raw materials 

arconic’s results of operations may be affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials including but not limited to aluminum cobalt nickel titanium sponge and vanadium as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials the availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of arconic’s products may be influenced by private or government entities including mergers and acquisitions changes in world politics or regulatory requirements labor relations between the producers and their work forces unstable governments in exporting nations export quotas sanctions new or increased import duties countervailing or antidumping duties market forces of supply and demand and inflation in addition from time to time commodity prices may fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions arconic may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through customer price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s operating results 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of arconic’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1  business of this report while arconic previously has been successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate all collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at arconic’s facilities in the future arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a failure to attract retain or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect arconic’s operations and competitiveness 

arconic’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company to attract and retain such people may adversely impact arconic’s ability to meet project demands adequately and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering manufacturing technology construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

in addition the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company’s growth and business strategy the loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm arconic’s business and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the company’s institutional knowledge base delay or impede the execution of the company’s business plans and erode arconic’s competitiveness

increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives such as capandtrade systems additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases or corporate average fuel economy cafe standards in the united states new or revised laws and regulations in this area could directly and indirectly affect arconic’s customers and suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or business through an impact on arconic’s inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for arconic products which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by the company or its customers or suppliers also arconic relies on natural gas electricity fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the company and its customers and suppliers which could also have a negative impact on arconic’s profitability 

antitakeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of arconic including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of arconic’s shareholders 

arconic’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with arconic’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover for example arconic is subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire arconic additionally the company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes arconic’s board of directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other antitakeover measures without shareholder approval these provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that arconic’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of arconic’s shareholders these provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of arconic common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

dividends on arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in business conditions or in other circumstances 

arconic has historically paid dividends on its common stock however it has no obligation to do so the existence timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to arconic’s shareholders falls within the discretion of arconic’s board of directors and the company’s dividend policy may change at any time without advance notice to arconic’s shareholders for example on february 8 2019 in connection with the company’s ongoing strategic and portfolio review arconic announced that it expected to reduce its quarterly common stock dividend from 006 to 002 per share the arconic board of directors’ decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as arconic’s financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations covenants associated with certain of the company’s debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that arconic’s board of directors deems relevant arconic’s board of directors may determine to further reduce or eliminate arconic’s common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions or in other circumstances 

changes in the united kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the european union could adversely affect arconic 

in march 2017 the united kingdom formally triggered the process to withdraw from the european union also referred to as brexit following the results of a national referendum that took place in june 2016 the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic are difficult to predict but because the company currently operates and conducts business in the united kingdom and in europe brexit could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to arconic’s businesses including affecting the business of andor our relationships with arconic’s customers and suppliers as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies including the value of the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect arconic’s financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the united kingdom and the european union are established the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the united kingdom and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

arconic may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation from alcoa corporation and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially adversely affect arconic’s business 

arconic may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all the separation is expected to provide the following benefits among others i enabling the management of each company to pursue more effectively its own distinct operating priorities and strategies to focus on strengthening its core business and its unique needs and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for longterm growth and profitability ii permitting each company to allocate its financial resources to meet the unique needs of its own business allowing each company to intensify its focus on its distinct strategic priorities and to pursue more effectively its own distinct capital structures and capital allocation strategies iii allowing each company to articulate more effectively a clear investment thesis to attract a longterm investor base suited to its business and providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities iv creating an independent equity currency tracking each companys underlying business affording arconic and alcoa corporation direct access to the capital markets and facilitating each company’s ability to consummate future acquisitions or other restructuring transactions utilizing its common stock v allowing each company more consistent application of incentive structures and targets due to the common nature of the underlying businesses and vi separating and simplifying the structures required to manage two distinct and differing underlying businesses 

arconic may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons including among others i arconic may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if alcoa corporation were still a part of the company because arconic’s business is less diversified than it was prior to the completion of the separation and ii as a smaller independent company arconic may be unable to obtain certain goods services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those it obtained prior to completion of the separation if arconic fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed it could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alcoa corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation arconic and alcoa corporation entered into a separation and distribution agreement and also entered into various other agreements of which the following were still in effect during 2018 a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement intellectual property license agreements a metal supply agreement real estate and office leases and a spare parts loan agreement the separation and distribution agreement the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the 

company prior to the separation was effected determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations arconic will rely on alcoa corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if alcoa corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties andor losses 

in connection with the separation from alcoa corporation alcoa corporation has agreed to indemnify arconic for certain liabilities and arconic has agreed to indemnify alcoa corporation for certain liabilities if arconic is required to pay under these indemnities to alcoa corporation arconic’s financial results could be negatively impacted the alcoa corporation indemnity may be insufficient to hold arconic harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which alcoa corporation will be allocated responsibility and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation has agreed to indemnify arconic for certain liabilities and arconic has agreed to indemnify alcoa corporation for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts indemnities that arconic may be required to provide alcoa corporation are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact arconic’s business third parties could also seek to hold arconic responsible for any of the liabilities that alcoa corporation has agreed to retain any amounts arconic is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require arconic to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the company’s operating business further the indemnity from alcoa corporation may be insufficient to protect arconic against the full amount of such liabilities and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully moreover even if arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which arconic is held liable arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses each of these risks could negatively affect arconic’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

it was a condition to the distribution that i the private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and the distribution received by arconic remain valid and be satisfactory to arconic’s board of directors and ii arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel satisfactory to the board of directors regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the distribution however the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of arconic and alcoa corporation including those relating to the past and future conduct of arconic and alcoa corporation if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if arconic or alcoa corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the separation related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding arconic’s receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by arconic of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge arconic alcoa corporation and arconic shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the alcoa corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and arconic shareholders who received alcoa corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under current us federal income tax law even if the distribution together with certain related transactions otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the distribution may nevertheless be 

rendered taxable to arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain postdistribution transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of arconic or alcoa corporation the possibility of rendering the distribution taxable as a result of such transactions may limit arconic’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of arconic’s business under the tax matters agreement that arconic entered into with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation may be required to indemnify arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of alcoa corporation whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether alcoa corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds iii repurchasing shares of alcoa corporation stock other than in certain openmarket transactions iv ceasing actively to conduct certain of its businesses v other actions or failures to act by alcoa corporation or vi any of alcoa corporation’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated however the indemnity from alcoa corporation may be insufficient to protect arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully moreover even if arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which arconic is held liable arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses in addition arconic and arconic’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation including tax costs resulting from separations in nonus jurisdictions which may be material each of these risks could negatively affect arconic’s business results of operations and financial condition

howard v arconic inc et al as previously reported a purported class action complaint related to the grenfell tower fire was filed on august 11 2017 in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania against arconic inc and klaus kleinfeld a related purported class action complaint was filed in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania on august 25 2017 under the caption sullivan v arconic inc et al  against arconic inc two former arconic executives several current and former arconic directors and banks that acted as underwriters for arconic’s september 18 2014 preferred stock offering the “preferred offering” the plaintiff in sullivan had previously filed a purported class action against the same defendants on july 18 2017 in the southern district of new york and on august 25 2017 voluntarily dismissed that action without prejudice on february 7 2018 on motion from certain putative class members the court consolidated howard and sullivan  closed sullivan  and appointed lead plaintiffs in the consolidated case on april 9 2018 the lead plaintiffs in the consolidated purported class action filed a consolidated amended complaint the consolidated amended complaint alleges that the registration statement for the preferred offering contained false and misleading statements and omitted to state material information including by allegedly failing to disclose material uncertainties and trends resulting from sales of reynobond pe for unsafe uses and by allegedly expressing a belief that appropriate risk management and compliance programs had been adopted while concealing the risks posed by reynobond pe sales the consolidated amended complaint also alleges that between november 4 2013 and june 23 2017 arconic and kleinfeld made false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material information about the company’s commitment to safety business and financial prospects and the risks of the reynobond pe product including in arconic’s form 10ks for the fiscal years ended december 31 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 its form 10qs and quarterly financial press releases from the fourth quarter of 2013 through the first quarter of 2017 its 2013 2014 2015 and 2016 annual reports and its 2016 annual highlights report the consolidated amended complaint seeks among other things unspecified compensatory damages and an award of attorney and expert fees and expenses on june 8 2018 all defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint for failure to state a claim briefing on that motion is now closed and the parties await a ruling 

raul v albaugh et al as previously reported on june 22 2018 a derivative complaint was filed nominally on behalf of arconic by a purported arconic shareholder against all current members of arconic’s board of directors klaus kleinfeld and ken giacobbe naming arconic as a nominal defendant in the united states district court for the district of delaware the complaint raises similar allegations as the consolidated amended complaint in howard  as well as allegations that the defendants improperly authorized the sale of reynobond pe for unsafe uses and asserts claims under section 14a of the securities exchange act of 1934 and delaware state law on july 13 2018 the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to stay this case until the final resolution of the howard case the grenfell tower public inquiry in london and the investigation by the london metropolitan police service and on june 23 2018 the court approved the stay 

while the company believes that these cases are without merit and intends to challenge them vigorously there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters given the preliminary nature of these matters and the uncertainty of litigation the company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the possible loss or range of losses in the event of an unfavorable outcome the board of directors has also received letters purportedly sent on behalf of shareholders reciting allegations similar to those made in the federal court lawsuits and demanding that the board 

authorize the company to initiate litigation against members of management the board and others the board of directors has appointed a special litigation committee of the board to review and make recommendations to the board regarding the appropriate course of action with respect to these shareholder demand letters the special litigation committee and the board are continuing to consider the appropriate responses to the shareholder demand letters in view of developments in proceedings concerning the grenfell tower fire 

other matters

tax 

pursuant to the tax matters agreement dated as of october 31 2016 entered into between the company and alcoa corporation in connection with the separation the company shares responsibility with alcoa corporation for and alcoa corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the company with respect to the following matter 

as previously reported in july 2013 following a spanish corporate income tax audit covering the 2006 through 2009 tax years an assessment was received mainly disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a spanish consolidated tax group owned by the company in august 2013 the company filed an appeal of this assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court which was denied in january 2015 arconic filed another appeal in spain’s national court in march 2015 which was denied in july 2018 the national court’s decision requires the assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years to be reissued to take into account the outcome of the 2003 to 2005 audit which was closed in 2017 the company estimates the revised assessment to be 174 million €152 million including interest 

the company has petitioned to the supreme court of spain to review the national court’s decision if the petition is accepted the supreme court will review the assessment on its merits and render a final decision in the event the company is unsuccessful in appealing the assessment to the supreme court of spain a portion of the assessment may be offset with existing net operating losses and tax credits available to the spanish consolidated tax group which would be shared between the company and alcoa corporation as provided for in the tax matters agreement as a result of the national court decision an income tax reserve including interest of 60 million €52 million was established in 2018 concurrent with the establishment of the reserve an indemnification receivable of 29 million €25 million representing alcoa corporation’s 49 share of the liability was also recorded in 2018 

additionally while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit it is possible that the company may receive assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013 any potential assessment for an individual tax year is not expected to be material to the company’s consolidated operations at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter 

matters previously reported – alcoa corporation 

we have included the matters discussed below in which the company remains party to proceedings relating to alcoa corporation in accordance with sec regulations the separation and distribution agreement dated october 31 2016 entered into between the company and alcoa corporation in connection with the separation provides for crossindemnities between the company and alcoa corporation for claims subject to indemnification the company does not expect any of such matters to result in a net claim against it

other contingencies 

in addition to the matters discussed above various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against arconic including those pertaining to environmental product liability safety and health employment tax and antitrust matters while the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that the company’s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on the results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company

engineered products and solutions 



the engineered products and solutions segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace commercial and defense industrial commercial transportation and power generation end markets such products include fastening systems titanium steel and nickel superalloys seamless rolled rings mostly nickel superalloys investment castings nickel superalloys titanium and aluminum including airfoils and forged jet engine components eg jet engine disks and extruded machined and formed aircraft parts titanium and aluminum all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors more than 75  of the thirdparty sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market a small part of this segment also produces various forged extruded and machined metal products titanium aluminum and steel for the oil and gas automotive and land and sea defense end markets seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the european summer slowdown across all end markets generally the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are mostly the us dollar british pound and the euro 

on december 31 2018 as part of the company’s ongoing strategy and portfolio review arconic completed the sale of its eger hungary forgings business that manufactured high volume steel forgings for drivetrain components in the european heavyduty truck and automotive market this business generated thirdparty sales of 32  38  and 29  in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively and had 180  employees at the time of the divestiture see restructuring and other charges under results of operations above 

in april 2016 arconic completed the sale of the remmele medical business that was part of the rti international metals inc rti acquisition that manufactured precisionmachined metal products for customers in the minimally invasive surgical device and implantable device markets remmele medical generated thirdparty sales of 23 from january 1 2016 through the divestiture date and at the time of the divestiture had approximately 330 employees 

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment increased   373  or 6  in 2018  compared with 2017  primarily attributable to higher volumes in the aerospace engines and defense end markets and favorable foreign currency movements partially offset by a decline in volumes in the industrial gas turbine market and lower aerospace pricing principally in the fasteners business 

thirdparty sales for this segment increased   215  or 4  in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily attributable to volume growth in both aerospace engines and airframes partially offset by lower product pricing primarily in the aerospace end market and the absence of sales of 23 related to the remmele medical business which was sold in april 2016 

segment operating profit   for the engineered products and solutions segment decreased   73  or 8  in 2018  compared with 2017  primarily attributable to performance shortfalls in the disks operations manufacturing inefficiencies in the engineered structures business including the now resolved forging press outage at the cleveland facility that impacted the fourth quarter of 2018 with higher costs of 10 unfavorable aerospace engine mix and new product introductions a physical inventory adjustment of 23 and lower aerospace pricing principally in the fasteners business partly offset by the strength in aerospace engine and defense volumes 

segment operating profit  for this segment increased   9  or 1  in 2017  compared with 2016    primarily on higher volumes and net cost savings partially offset by product pricing pressures ramp up costs associated with increasing production volumes of new aerospace engine parts and a lower margin product mix 

in 2019 demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong driven by the rampup of new aerospace engine platforms demand in the defense end market is expected to grow due to the continuing rampup of certain aerospace programs while declines in the industrial gas turbine market are expected to continue albeit at lower levels than in 2018 net cost savings and favorable pricing are expected 

global rolled products 1   



 the global rolled products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace automotive commercial transportation packaging building and construction and industrial products mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables end markets a small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers generally the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are mostly the us dollar chinese yuan the euro the russian ruble the brazilian real and the british pound 

on april 6 2018 the us treasury department’s office of foreign asset control “ofac” announced new sanctions against russian “oligarchs” and extended those sanctions to companies that are majorityowned or substantively controlled by those oligarchs these sanctions block us persons  both individuals and companies  from engaging in transactions with listed oligarchs and their companies these sanctions originally extended to uc rusal plc “rusal” which supplies primary aluminum to arconic in europe the united states and to the company’s samara plant in russia the company operated under a series of temporary licenses issued by ofac until january 27 2019 when ofac removed rusal from the list of sanctioned parties the company complies with and expects to continue to comply with all other aspects of these sanctions and we do not anticipate any interruption in samara’s ability to operate normally

thirdparty sales for the global rolled products segment increased   604  or 12  in 2018  compared with 2017  primarily attributable to higher aluminum prices higher volumes in the automotive commercial transportation and industrial end markets and favorable product mix partially offset by the absence of sales of 54 from the rolling mill in fusina italy divested in march 2017 and the planned ramp down of arconics north american packaging operations completed in december 2018 

thirdparty sales for this segment increased   135  or 3  in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily attributable to volume growth in the automotive end market and higher aluminum pricing partially offset by the impact of 362 associated with the rampdown and toll processing agreement with alcoa corporation at the company’s north america packaging business in tennessee the absence of sales of 111 from the rolling mill in fusina italy aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates and pricing pressures in the global packaging market 

segment operating profit  for the global rolled products segment decreased   38  or 9  in 2018  compared with 2017  primarily driven by unfavorable aerospace widebody production mix higher aluminum prices and higher transportation costs and scrap spreads partially offset by higher automotive commercial transportation and industrial volumes the higher aluminum prices negatively impacted segment operating profit margin by 30 or 100 basis points in 2018 compared with 2017 

segment operating profit  for this segment increased   3  or 1  in 2017  compared with 2016    primarily driven by net cost savings and increased automotive volumes partially offset by lower aerospace volume from customer destocking and reduced build rates continued pricing pressure on global packaging products and higher aluminum prices the higher aluminum prices 

negatively impacted segment operating profit margin by 37 or 150 basis points in 2017 compared with 2016 

in 2019 demand in the north america commercial transportation brazing and industrial end markets is expected to grow as a result of the international trade commission initiated common alloy trade case demand in the automotive end market is expected to continue to grow due to the growing demand for innovative products and aluminumintensive vehicles demand from the commercial airframe end market is expected to be flat as the rampup of new programs is offset by lower build rates for aluminum intensive widebody programs net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue 

transportation and construction solutions   



the transportation and construction solutions segment produces products that are used mostly in the commercial transportation and nonresidential building and construction end markets such products include integrated aluminum structural systems architectural extrusions and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels which are sold both directly to customers and through distributors a small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market generally the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are primarily the us dollar the euro and the brazilian real

thirdparty sales for the transportation and construction solutions segment increased   115  or 6  in 2018  compared with 2017  primarily driven by higher volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets favorable foreign currency movements and higher aluminum prices partially offset by the absence of sales of 90 resulting from the divestiture of the latin america extrusions business in april 2018 

thirdparty sales for this segment increased   209  or 12  in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily driven by increased volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets higher aluminum pricing and favorable foreign currency movements partially offset by lower product pricing 

segment operating profit  for the transportation and construction solutions segment increased   14  or 5  in 2018  compared with 2017  principally driven by higher volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets and net cost savings which more than offset higher aluminum prices the higher aluminum prices negatively impacted segment operating margin by 57 or 270 basis points in 2018 compared with 2017 

segment operating profit  for this segment increased   44  or 18  in 2017  compared with 2016  principally driven by net cost savings and higher volumes partially offset by lower product pricing in the heavyduty truck market unfavorable product mix and higher aluminum prices the higher aluminum prices negatively impacted segment operating margin by 8 or 90 basis points in 2017 compared with 2016 

in 2019 we expect continued growth in the north american and european commercial transportation and building and construction markets and continued demand for innovative products net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters the testing of goodwill other intangible assets and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a  to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

environmental matters  expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters  for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

goodwill  goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment arconic had six reporting units for 2018 of which three were included in the engineered products and solutions segment arconic fastening systems arconic engines arconic engineered structures two were included in the transportation and construction solutions segment arconic wheel and transportation products and building and construction systems and the remaining reporting unit was the global rolled products segment 

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the 

existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50  that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test 

arconic determines annually based on facts and circumstances which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment for those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not a quantitative impairment test will be performed arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three year period 

during the 2018  annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all six of its reporting units the estimated fair values for each of the six reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 25 thus there was no goodwill impairment under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill arconic uses a discounted cash flow model dcf to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including sales growth volumes and pricing production costs capital spending and discount rate most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the wacc rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

goodwill impairment tests in 2017  and 2016  indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units except for the arconic forgings and extrusions afe business whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value as such arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the afe reporting unit of 719  the decrease in the afe fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the riskfree rate of return while the carrying value increased compared to prior year 

properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets  properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

in the second quarter of 2018 the company updated its threeyear strategic plan and determined that there was a decline in the forecasted financial performance for the disks operations an asset group within the aen business unit as such the company evaluated the recoverability of the longlived assets by comparing their carrying value of approximately 515  to the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the disks operations resulting in an estimated fair value in excess of their carrying value of approximately 13  thus there was no impairment if the disks operations do not achieve the revised forecasted financial performance or if there are changes in any significant assumptions a material noncash impairment of longlived assets may occur in future periods these significant assumptions include sales growth cost of raw materials ramp up of additional production capacity and working capital a 1 decrease in the forecasted net cash flows would reduce the undiscounted cash flows by approximately 6  there were no indicators of impairment identified for the disks operations during the third or fourth quarters of 2018 and as such the company did not evaluate the recoverability of its longlived assets 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale  the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits  liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking industrials transportation and utilities among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2018  2017  and 2016  the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 435  375  and 420  respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 170 and either a charge or credit of approximately 2 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

in conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2015 management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond previously the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations under the new methodology the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate referred to as the “spot rate” approach this change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology in 2018 2017 and 2016 of 24 34 and 84 respectively for pension plans and 4 6 and 14 respectively for other postretirement benefit plans management believes this new methodology which represents a change in an accounting estimate is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns the assumption represents a longterm prospective return management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2018  2017  and 2016  management used 700  775  and 775  respectively as its expected longterm rate of return which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class these rates fell within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class for 2019  management anticipates that 700 will be the expected longterm rate of return the decrease of 75 basis points in the 2018 expected longterm rate of return was due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20year moving average a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 10 for 2019  

in 2018 a net loss of 114 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the impact of the adoption of new accounting guidance that permits a reclassification to accumulated deficit for stranded tax effects resulting from the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 as well as the plan asset performance that was less than expected which were partially offset by the increase in the discount rate of 60 basis points and the amortization of actuarial losses in 2017 a net loss of 220 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 45 basis points and plan asset performance less than expected which were partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses in 2016 a net benefit of 1601 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the transfer of 2080 to alcoa corporation which was partially offset by a net charge of 479 the charge was due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets and a 9 basis point decrease in the discount rate which were partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation  arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value forfeitures are accounted for as they occur the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model the fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a monte carlo valuation model determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

compensation expense recorded in 2018  2017  and 2016  was 50   39  aftertax 54   36  aftertax and 76   51  aftertax respectively 

income taxes  the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

the 2017 act created a new requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries global intangible low taxed income gilti must be included in the gross income of the us shareholder the 2017 act also established the base erosion and antiabuse tax beat until regulations are finalized judgement will be required to apply preliminary guidance including proposed regulations to arconic’s facts and circumstances 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and arconic’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

in 2018 arconic made a final accounting policy election to apply a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset gilti income inclusions under this approach reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment instead future gilti inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that supports the realizability of deferred tax assets 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

generally other materials are purchased from thirdparty suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements the company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available 

patents trade secrets and trademarks 

the company believes that its domestic and international patent trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage the company’s rights under its patents as well as the products made and sold under them are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment the patents owned by arconic generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques arconic’s business as a whole is not however materially dependent on any single patent trade secret or trademark as a result of product development and technological advancement the company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world as of the end of 2017  the company’s worldwide patent portfolio consists of approximately 1669  granted patents and 807  pending patent applications 

the company also has a significant number of trade secrets mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets the company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits 

with respect to domestic and international registered trademarks the company has many that have significant recognition within the markets that are served examples include the name “arconic” and the arconic symbol for aluminum nickel and titanium products howmet ®  metal castings huck ®  fasteners kawneer ®  building panels and durabright ®  wheels with easy 

clean surface treatments a significant trademark filing campaign for the name “arconic” was completed in 2016 in support of the corporate launch of arconic inc as of the end of 2017 the company’s worldwide trademark portfolio consists of approximately 1793  registered trademarks and 625  pending trademark applications the company’s rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment 

competitive conditions 

engineered products and solutions eps 

ep  s’s business units  afs arconic fastening systems ae arconic engines and aes arconic engineered structures are subject to substantial and intense competition in the markets they serve although arconic believes its advanced technology manufacturing processes and experience provide advantages to arconic’s customers such as high quality and superior mechanical properties that meet the company’s customers’ most stringent requirements many of the products arconic makes can be produced by competitors using similar types of manufacturing processes as well as alternative forms of manufacturing despite intense competition arconic continues as a market leader in most of its principal markets several factors including arconic’s legacy of technical innovation stateoftheart capabilities engaged employees and longstanding customer relationships enable the company to maintain its competitive position 

principal competitors in the eps segment include berkshire hathaway inc through its acquisition of precision castparts corporation and subsidiaries for titanium and titaniumbased alloys precision forgings seamless rolled rings investment castings and aerospace fasteners vsmpo russia for titanium and titaniumbased alloys and precision forgings the highperformance materials  components segment of allegheny technologies inc ati for titanium and titaniumbased alloys precision forgings and investment castings lisi aerospace france for aerospace fasteners and aubert  duval part of eramet group in france for precision forgings 

other competitors include 

• kaiser aluminum  for extruded products 

• universal alloy corp part of montana tech components  for extruded products 

• doncasters group ltd uk  for investment castings 

• consolidated precision products corp part of warburg pincus  for investment castings 

• weber metals part of otto fuchs  for precision forgings 

• forgital  for seamless rings 

several of arconic’s largest customers have captive superalloy furnaces for producing airfoil investment castings for their own use many other companies around the world also produce superalloy investment castings and some of these companies currently compete with arconic in the aerospace and other markets while others are capable of competing with the company should they choose to do so 

international competition in the investment casting  fastener ring and forging markets may also increase in the future as a result of strategic alliances among engine original equipment manufacturers oems aerostructure prime contractors and overseas companies especially in developing markets particularly where “offset” or “local content” requirements create purchase obligations with respect to products manufactured in or directed to a particular country 

global rolled products grp 

grp is one of the leaders in many of the aluminum flat rolled products markets in which it participates including aerospace automotive brazing sheet commercial transportation industrial markets and packaging however much like other arconic businesses grp is subject to substantial and intense competition in all of its markets 

while grp participates in markets where arconic believes the company has a significant competitive advantage due to customer intimacy advanced manufacturing capability unique technology andor differentiated products in certain cases the company’s competitors are capable of making products similar to arconic’s the company continuously works to maintain and enhance its competitive advantage through innovation new alloys such as arconic’s new aerospace alloys new products such as the company’s 5layer brazing products and breakthrough processes such as arconic micromill® technology 

some of grp’s markets are worldwide and some are more regionally focused participation in these segments by grp’s competitors varies for example novelis is the largest flat rolled products producer competing in automotive but it does not participate in the aerospace market on the other hand constellium participates in all major market segments including aerospace brazing industrial commercial transportation and packaging granges participates only in the brazing sheet market other grp competitors include aleris amag kaiser kobe nanshan and uacj 

additionally there are a number of new competitors emerging particularly in china and other developing economies for example in the brazing business the number of viable competitors has doubled over a fiveyear period arconic expects that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs the company continually monitors and plans for these new emerging players

 item 1a risk factors 

arconic’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business financial condition or results of operations including causing arconic’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to arconic or that arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company in future periods 

the markets for arconic’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals enduse markets arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the aerospace automotive and commercial transportation and construction industries and the demand for its products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond its control 

in particular arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft the us and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability trends in airline passenger traffic the state of us regional and world economies the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism health and safety concerns environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators the retirement of older aircraft and 

technological improvements to new engines the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding however it is also driven by the effects of terrorism a changing global political environment us foreign policy the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines 

further the demand for arconic’s automotive and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive manufacturers and arconic content per vehicle the automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions including credit markets and interest rates and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage vehicle size configuration and features automotive sales and production can also be affected by other factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates labor relations issues fuel prices regulatory requirements government initiatives trade agreements and levels of competition 

while arconic believes that the longterm prospects for its products are positive the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables the strength of the us regional or global economies or the effects of government intervention negative economic conditions such as a major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1 businesscompetitive conditions of this report the markets for arconic’s products are highly competitive arconic’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets new product offerings or new technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace arconic products the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by arconic the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for arconic’s products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting arconic’s competitors or customers could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic may be unable to develop innovative new products or implement technology initiatives successfully 

arconic’s competitive position and future performance depends in part on the company’s ability to 

 arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments including additive manufacturing alloy development engineered finishes and product design high speed continuous casting and rolling technology and other advanced manufacturing technologies for more information on arconic’s research and development programs see “research and development” in part i item 1 business of this report 

while arconic intends to continue committing substantial financial resources and effort to the development of innovative new products and services it may not be able to successfully differentiate its products or services from those of its competitors or match the level of research and development spending of its competitors including those developing technology to displace arconic’s current products in addition arconic may not be able to adapt to evolving markets and technologies or achieve and maintain technological advantages there can be no assurance that any of arconic’s new products or services development programs or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to arconic 

arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer or customers supplied by arconic could affect arconic’s financial results in a particular period arconic’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other 

difficulties in their businesses arconic’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with arconic including to reduce the amount of arconic’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers if arconic is unsuccessful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance quality or safety which could affect arconic’s reputation business and financial statements 

the manufacture of many of arconic’s products is a highly exacting and complex process problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols specifications and procedures including those related to quality or safety problems with raw materials supply chain interruptions natural disasters labor unrest and environmental factors such problems could have an adverse impact on the company’s ability to fulfill orders or on product quality or performance product manufacturing or performance issues could result in recalls customer penalties contract cancellation and product liability exposure including if any of our products are defective or are used in a manner that results in injuries or other damages because of approval and license requirements applicable to manufacturers andor their suppliers alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to the company or its customers accordingly manufacturing problems product defects or other risks associated with our products including their use or application could result in significant costs to and liability for arconic that could have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations including the payment of potentially substantial monetary damages fines or penalties as well as negative publicity and damage to the company’s reputation which could adversely impact product demand and customer relationships 

arconic’s business depends in part on its ability to meet increased program demand successfully and to mitigate the impact of program cancellations reductions and delays 

arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial general aviation and military aircraft programs and is the sole supplier of aluminum sheet for a number of aluminumintensive automotive vehicle programs many of these programs are scheduled for production increases over the next several years if arconic fails to meet production levels or encounters difficulty or unexpected costs in meeting such levels it could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition or results of operations similarly program cancellations reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business 

arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending 

arconic’s products are used in a variety of military applications including military aircraft and armored vehicles although many of the programs in which arconic participates extend several years they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations changes in military strategy and priorities or reductions in defense spending may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for arconic’s products which could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic’s global operations expose the company to risks that could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states including europe brazil canada china japan and russia as a result the company’s global operations are affected by economic political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which arconic does business as well as us laws regulating international trade including 



 although the effect of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations while arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management compliance programs and insurance arrangements to address and reduce the risks associated with these factors such measures may provide inadequate protection against costs or liabilities that may arise from such events 

arconic may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the company’s reputation business and competitive position 

arconic owns important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets the company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining arconic’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the company serves arconic’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to arconic’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents arconic owns or licenses the pursuit of remedies for any misappropriation of such intellectual property is expensive and the ultimate remedies may be deemed insufficient further as the company expands its operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of misappropriation of arconic intellectual property increases despite efforts the company undertakes to protect them developments or assertions by or against arconic relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce these rights sufficiently could adversely affect arconic’s business and competitive position 

arconic may be unable to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions divestitures joint ventures and strategic alliances 

arconic has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow its business or streamline its portfolio although management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to arconic there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized acquisitions present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company unanticipated costs and liabilities and the ability to realize anticipated benefits such as growth in market share revenue or margins at the levels or in the timeframe expected the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully additionally adverse factors may prevent arconic from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines 

with respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures curtailments and closures arconic may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders in addition arconic may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments arconic’s business operations are capital intensive and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges including employee separation costs asset impairment charges and other measures 

in addition arconic has participated in and may continue to participate in joint ventures strategic alliances and other similar arrangements from time to time although the company has in connection with past and existing joint ventures sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks whether or not arconic holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 there can be no assurance that acquisitions growth investments divestitures closures joint ventures strategic alliances or similar arrangements will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to arconic whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

arconic may be unable to realize future targets or goals established for its business segments at the levels or by the dates targeted 

from time to time arconic may announce future targets or goals for its business which are based on the company’s then current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the operating environment economies and markets in which arconic operates future targets and goals reflect the company’s beliefs and assumptions and its perception of historical trends then current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances as such targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events including the risks discussed in this report the actual outcome may be materially different there can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all failure to achieve the targets or goals by the company may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations or the market price of its securities 

cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of arconic’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

arconic faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on arconic’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact arconic’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and result in the diminution of the value of the company’s investment in research and development 

a decline in arconic’s financial performance or outlook could negatively impact the company’s access to the global capital markets reduce the company’s liquidity and increase its borrowing costs 

arconic has significant capital requirements and depends in part upon the issuance of debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments and pursue strategic acquisitions a decline in the company’s financial performance or outlook 

due to internal or external factors could affect the company’s access to and the availability or cost of financing on acceptable terms and conditions there can be no assurance that arconic will have access to the global capital market on terms the company finds acceptable limitations on arconic’s ability to access the global capital markets a reduction in the company’s liquidity or an increase in borrowing costs could materially and adversely affect arconic’s ability to maintain or grow its business which in turn may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations 

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings could limit arconic’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs increase the pricing of its credit facilities adversely affect the market price of its securities trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

arconic’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate arconic’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to the company this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting on may 1 2017 standard and poor’s ratings services affirmed arconic’s longterm debt at bbb an investment grade rating with a stable outlook and its shortterm debt at a3 on november 1 2016 moody’s investor service moody’s downgraded arconic’s longterm debt rating from ba1 a noninvestment grade to ba2 and its shortterm debt rating from speculative grade liquidity1 to speculative grade liquidity2 additionally moody’s changed the outlook from negative to stable ratings and outlook were affirmed on november 2 2017 on april 21 2016 fitch affirmed arconic’s longterm debt rating at bb a noninvestment grade and shortterm debt at b additionally fitch changed the current outlook from positive to evolving on july 7 2016 fitch changed the current outlook from evolving to stable ratings and outlook were affirmed on july 3 2017 

there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to arconic’s ratings increased debt levels macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of arconic’s securities adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by standard and poor’s or a further downgrade by moody’s would subject arconic to higher costs under arconic’s fiveyear revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from arconic or otherwise impair arconic’s business financial condition and results of operations 

arconic’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures 

arconic requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact arconic’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and returnseeking capital projects over the long term arconic’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions which could adversely affect the longterm value of its business and the company’s position in relation to its competitors 

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect arconic’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

arconic’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors arconic calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by arconic to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition arconic is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how arconic’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimatespension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion 

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note t to the consolidated financial statementspension and other postretirement benefits in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities arconic would contribute to the pension plans 

potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act “map21” enacted in 2012 provided temporary relief for employers like arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations in 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law hatfa extended the relief provided by map21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map21 in 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 bba 2015 was signed into law bba 2015 extends the relief period provided by hafta arconic believes that the relief provided by bba 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years however higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the company’s cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans which could adversely affect arconic’s liquidity and results of operations 

unanticipated changes in arconic’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect arconic’s future profitability 

arconic is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect the company’s tax expense and profitability arconic’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures 

corporate tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions in particular on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the “2017 act” was signed into law significantly reforming the united states internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the company continues to review the components of the 2017 act and evaluate its consequences as such the ultimate impact of the 2017 act may differ from reported amounts possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations and assumptions the company has made guidance that may be issued and actions the company may take as a result of the 2017 act the changes to the us corporate tax system resulting from the 2017 act could have a substantial impact positive or negative on arconic’s future effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

arconic’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum 

arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminumbased products the price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable although the company’s pricing of products is generally intended to pass the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the company’s customers arconic may be unable to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there can be a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the company can implement a corresponding increase in price to its customers as a result arconic may be exposed to such price fluctuations during the time lag if this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which arconic operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and 

financial environment could affect arconic’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies including the euro british pound chinese yuan renminbi and russian ruble may affect arconic’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies while the company’s products are generally sold in us dollars 

arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

arconic has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including deployment of companywide business process models such as arconic’s degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings and overhead cost reductions there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized if arconic fails to achieve net cost savings at anticipated levels its business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 

arconic’s customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials 

certain applications of arconic’s aluminumbased products compete with products made from other materials such as steel titanium and composites the willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes for example the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum such as titanium and composites in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft additionally the automotive industry while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of aluminum may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications further the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices the willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for certain of arconic’s products and thus adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic’s profitability could be adversely affected by volatility in the availability or cost of raw materials 

arconic’s results of operations may be affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials eg aluminum nickel titanium dioxide as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials the availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of arconic’s products may be influenced by private or government entities changes in world politics or regulatory requirements labor relations between the producers and their work forces unstable governments in exporting nations export quotas sanctions new or increased import duties countervailing or antidumping duties market forces of supply and demand and inflation in addition from time to time commodity prices may fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions arconic may be unable to offset fully the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s operating results 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a significant portion of arconic’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1 business of this report while arconic was previously successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at arconic’s facilities in the future arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

a failure to attract retain or provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could adversely affect arconic’s operations and competitiveness 

arconic’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company to attract and retain such people may adversely impact arconic’s ability to meet project demands adequately and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering manufacturing technology construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

in addition the continuity of key personnel and the preservation of institutional knowledge are vital to the success of the company’s growth and business strategy the loss of key members of management and other personnel could significantly harm arconic’s business and any unplanned turnover or failure to develop adequate succession plans for key positions could deplete the company’s institutional knowledge base delay or impede the execution of the company’s business plans and erode arconic’s competitiveness 

arconic may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to arconic the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal and regulatory compliance risks associated with its business and products these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts and taxes as well as compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations governing export antibribery antitrust and competition sales and trading practices and the manufacture and sale of products arconic could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts 

for example in the event that an arconic product fails to perform as expected regardless of fault or is used in an unexpected manner and such failure or use results in or is alleged to result in bodily injury andor property damage or other losses arconic may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or may be required or requested by its customers to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such product in addition if an arconic product is perceived to be defective or unsafe sales of the company’s products could be diminished and the company could be subject to further liability claims even if arconic successfully defends against these types of claims the company could still be required to spend a substantial amount of money in connection with legal proceedings or investigations with respect to such claims the company’s management could be required to devote significant time attention and operational resources responding to and defending against these claims and arconic’s reputation could suffer any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

while arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks including insurance arrangements with respect to these risks such measures may provide inadequate protection against liabilities that may arise the global and diverse nature of arconic’s operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously unsusceptible to reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note l to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

arconic is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

arconic’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which arconic may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by the company sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future compliance with health safety and environmental laws and regulations may prove to be more challenging and costly than the company anticipates for example new data and information including information about the ways in which the company’s products are used may lead the company regulatory authorities government agencies or other entities or organizations to publish guidelines or recommendations or impose restrictions related to the manufacturing or use of the company’s products this could lead to 

reduced sales or market acceptance of the company’s products arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites as well as other health and safety risks relating to its operations and products additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on the company’s financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

arconic is subject to privacy and data securityprotection laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements for example the european unions general data protection regulation “gdpr’ which will become effective in may 2018 imposes significant new requirements on how companies process and transfer personal data as well as significant fines for noncompliance compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes which could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s financial condition and results of operations in addition the payment of potentially significant fines or penalties in the event of a breach of the gdrp or other privacy and information security laws as well as the negative publicity associated with such a breach could damage the company’s reputation and adversely impact product demand and customer relationships 

arconic may be subject to securities litigation which could cause the company to incur substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources 

arconic currently is and may in the future become subject to claims and litigation alleging violations of the securities laws arconic is generally obliged to the extent permitted by law to indemnify its current and former directors and officers who are named as defendants in these types of lawsuits regardless of the outcome securities litigation may require substantial attention from management and could result in significant legal expenses settlement costs or damage awards that could have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

failure to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business results 

arconic is subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws such as the fair labor standards act which governs such matters as minimum wages overtime and other working conditions state and local wage laws the employee retirement income security act “erisa” and regulations related to safety discrimination organizing whistleblowing classification of employees privacy and severance payments citizenship requirements and healthcare insurance mandates allegations that arconic has violated such laws or regulations could damage the company’s reputation and lead to fines from or settlements with federal state or foreign regulatory authorities or damages payable to employees which could have a material adverse impact on arconic’s operations and financial condition 

arconic may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives such as capandtrade systems and additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases new laws enacted could directly and indirectly affect arconic’s customers and suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or business through an impact on arconic’s inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for arconic products which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by the company or its customers or suppliers also arconic relies on natural gas electricity fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the company and its customers and suppliers which could also have a negative impact on arconic’s profitability 

antitakeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of arconic including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of arconic’s shareholders 

arconic’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain and delaware law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with arconic’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover for example arconic is subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which imposes certain restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the company and any holder of 15 or more of the company’s outstanding common stock which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire arconic additionally the company’s certificate of incorporation authorizes arconic’s board of directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other 

antitakeover measures without shareholder approval these provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that arconic’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of arconic’s shareholders these provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of arconic common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

dividends on arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in business conditions or in other circumstances 

the existence timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to arconic’s shareholders falls within the discretion of arconic’s board of directors the arconic board of director’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as arconic’s financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations covenants associated with certain of the company’s debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that arconic’s board of directors deems relevant arconic’s board of directors may determine to reduce or eliminate arconic’s common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions or in other circumstances 

changes in the united kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the european union could adversely affect arconic 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum also referred to as “brexit” the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic are difficult to predict but because the company currently operates and conducts business in the united kingdom and in europe the results of the referendum and any eventual withdrawal could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to arconic’s businesses including affecting the business of andor our relationships with arconic’s customers and suppliers as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies including the value of the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect arconic’s financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the united kingdom and the european union are established the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the united kingdom and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently 

arconic may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially adversely affect arconic’s business 

arconic may be unable to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all the separation is expected to provide the following benefits among others i enabling the management of each company to pursue more effectively its own distinct operating priorities and strategies to focus on strengthening its core business and its unique needs and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for longterm growth and profitability ii permitting each company to allocate its financial resources to meet the unique needs of its own business allowing each company to intensify its focus on its distinct strategic priorities and to pursue more effectively its own distinct capital structures and capital allocation strategies iii allowing each company to articulate more effectively a clear investment thesis to attract a longterm investor base suited to its business and providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities iv creating an independent equity currency tracking each company’s underlying business affording arconic and alcoa corporation direct access to the capital markets and facilitating each company’s ability to consummate future acquisitions or other restructuring transactions utilizing its common stock v allowing each company more consistent application of incentive structures and targets due to the common nature of the underlying businesses and vi separating and simplifying the structures required to manage two distinct and differing underlying businesses 

arconic may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons including among others i arconic may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if alcoa corporation were still a part of the company because arconic’s business is less diversified than it was prior to the completion of the separation and ii as a smaller independent company arconic may be unable to obtain certain goods services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those it obtained prior to completion of the separation if arconic fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed it could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alcoa corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation arconic and alcoa corporation entered into a separation and distribution agreement and also entered into various other agreements including a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement intellectual property license agreements a metal supply agreement real estate and office leases a spare parts loan agreement and an agreement relating to the north american packaging business the separation and distribution agreement the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the company prior to the separation was effected determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations arconic will rely on alcoa corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if alcoa corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties andor losses 

in connection with the separation alcoa corporation has agreed to indemnify arconic for certain liabilities and arconic has agreed to indemnify alcoa corporation for certain liabilities if arconic is required to pay under these indemnities to alcoa corporation arconic’s financial results could be negatively impacted the alcoa corporation indemnity may be insufficient to hold arconic harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which alcoa corporation will be allocated responsibility and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation has agreed to indemnify arconic for certain liabilities and arconic has agreed to indemnify alcoa corporation for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts indemnities that arconic may be required to provide alcoa corporation are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact arconic’s business third parties could also seek to hold arconic responsible for any of the liabilities that alcoa corporation has agreed to retain any amounts arconic is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require arconic to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the company’s operating business further the indemnity from alcoa corporation may be insufficient to protect arconic against the full amount of such liabilities and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully moreover even if arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which arconic is held liable arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses each of these risks could negatively affect arconic’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

it was a condition to the distribution that i the private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and the distribution received by arconic remain valid and be satisfactory to arconic’s board of directors and ii arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel satisfactory to the board of directors regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” both of these conditions were satisfied prior to the distribution however the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of arconic and alcoa corporation including those relating to the past and future conduct of arconic and alcoa corporation if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if arconic or alcoa corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the separation related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding arconic’s receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by arconic of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the 

event the irs were to prevail with such challenge arconic alcoa corporation and arconic shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the alcoa corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and arconic shareholders who received alcoa corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under current us federal income tax law even if the distribution together with certain related transactions otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the distribution may nevertheless be rendered taxable to arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain postdistribution transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of arconic or alcoa corporation the possibility of rendering the distribution taxable as a result of such transactions may limit arconic’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of arconic’s business under the tax matters agreement that arconic entered into with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation may be required to indemnify arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of alcoa corporation whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether alcoa corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds iii repurchasing shares of alcoa corporation stock other than in certain openmarket transactions iv ceasing actively to conduct certain of its businesses v other actions or failures to act by alcoa corporation or vi any of alcoa corporation’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated however the indemnity from alcoa corporation may be insufficient to protect arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities and alcoa corporation may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations fully moreover even if arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which arconic is held liable arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses in addition arconic and arconic’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation including tax costs resulting from separations in nonus jurisdictions which may be material each of these risks could negatively affect arconic’s business results of operations and financial condition

tax 

pursuant to the tax matters agreement dated as of october 31 2016 entered into between the company and alcoa corporation in connection with the separation the company shares responsibility with alcoa corporation for and alcoa corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the company with respect to the following matter 

as previously reported in september 2010 following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years an assessment was received as a result of spain’s tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a spanish consolidated tax group owned by the company an appeal of this assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court by the company was denied in october 2013 in december 2013 the company filed an appeal of the assessment in spain’s national court 

on january 16 2017 spain’s national court issued a decision in favor of the company related to the assessment received in september 2010 the spanish tax administration did not file an appeal within the applicable period based on this decision and recent confirming correspondence from the spanish tax administration the matter is now closed the company will not be responsible for any assessment related to the 2003 through 2005 tax years 

additionally following a corporate income tax audit of the same spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax years spain’s tax authorities issued an assessment in july 2013 similarly disallowing certain interest deductions in august 2013 the company filed an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court which was denied in january 2015 the company filed an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s national court in march 2015 spain’s national court has not yet rendered a decision related to the assessment received in july 2013 the assessment for the 2006 through 2009 tax years is 155 million €130 million including interest 

the company believes it has meritorious arguments to support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through spain’s court system however in the event the company is unsuccessful a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available to the spanish consolidated tax group which would be shared between the company and alcoa corporation as provided for in the tax matters agreement additionally while the tax years 2010 through 2013 are closed to audit it is possible that the company may receive similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2013 at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter

other contingencies 

in addition to the matters discussed above various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against arconic including those pertaining to environmental product liability safety and health employment and tax matters while the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that the company’s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on the results of operations financial position or cash flows of the company

management review of 2017  and outlook for the future 

in 2017 arconic’s revenues increased 5 over 2016 as a result of higher volumes across all segments including strong volume growth in our aerospace automotive and commercial transportation markets and higher aluminum pricing primarily impacting the global rolled products segment partially offset by the planned ramp down and toll processing and services agreement the “toll processing agreement” relating to the company’s north america packaging business in tennessee and unfavorable product pricing and mix in the segments adjusted ebitda increased over 2016 as a result of the aforementioned higher volumes and continued focus on net cost savings that more than offset negative factors including product pricing pressures ramp up costs associated with new aerospace engine parts aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates and higher aluminum prices 

loss from continuing operations after income taxes was 74 in 2017 compared to 1062 in 2016 there were several significant items that impacted the fourth quarter of 2017 the company recorded a charge of 719 719 pretax associated with the impairment of goodwill in the forgings and extrusions business and a charge of 41 41 pretax for the impairment of assets in the latin america extrusions business in conjunction with an agreement to sell the business also in the fourth quarter of 2017 the company recorded income of 97 106 pretax associated with the reversal of liabilities for a contingent earnout and a separationrelated guarantee the company was also impacted by the tax cuts and jobs act enacted on december 22 2017 “the 2017 act” and recorded a provisional charge of 272 associated with the revaluation of us net deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 as well as a onetime transition tax on the nonpreviously taxed earnings and profits of certain usowned foreign corporations as of december 31 2017 the impact of the 2017 act provisions will be updated over the course of 2018 in accordance with guidance issued by the securities and exchange commission which has provided a oneyear measurement period to finalize the accounting impacts of the new legislation and as additional guidance is issued and the new law is further analyzed 

additionally during 2017 the company disposed of its retained interest in alcoa corporation common stock and recorded gains of 405 518 pretax and the company redeemed debt of 1250 recording charges of 49 76 pretax primarily for the premium paid for the early redemption of the debt see discussion that follows under results of operations below for further information on 2017 results 

management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions streamlined organizational structures margin enhancement and profitable revenue generation management has also intensified its focus on capital efficiency this focus and the related results enabled arconic to end 2017 with a solid financial position 

the following financial information reflects certain key measures of arconic’s 2017  results 

 1 for the reconciliation of net loss attributable to arconic to consolidated adjusted ebitda and related information see page 45 

in 2018 management projects that sales will be up 3 to 6 based on volume and share gains as well as higher aluminum prices in aerospace it is anticipated that the favorable impact of share gains on new platforms and engines will be somewhat offset by lower pricing and the mix of widebody and narrowbody aircraft produced management also expects strong growth in automotive sheet and commercial transportation markets particularly due to north american and european heavyduty truck production increases while the industrial gas turbine market will continue declining throughout 2018 

looking ahead over the next year management will continue to focus on improving operating performance through cost reductions margin enhancement and profitable revenue generation as part of this effort the company made the decision to freeze its us defined benefit pension plans for all usbased salaried and nonbargained hourly employees effective april 1 2018 and the company intends to relocate its global headquarters by the end of 2018 out of new york city to a more costeffective location management has initiated a review of the company’s strategy and portfolio additionally each of the segments are projected to achieve net cost savings in 2018 as a result adjusted earnings per share is anticipated to increase and free cash flow is also expected to improve in 2018 through increased focus on driving operational improvements and working capital efficiency 

to further enhance the company’s financial position and return capital to shareholders arconic’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 500 of its outstanding common stock and a 500 early debt reduction under the share repurchase program the company may repurchase shares from time to time in amounts at prices and at such times as the company deems appropriate repurchases will be subject to market conditions legal requirements and other considerations the company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares or to do so at any particular time and the share repurchase program may be suspended modified or terminated at any time without prior notice for the early debt reduction arconic intends to redeem in march 2018 all of its outstanding 572 notes due in 2019 

beginning in the first quarter of 2018 the companys primary measure of segment performance will change from adjusted ebitda to operating income which more closely aligns segment performance with operating income as presented in the statement of consolidated operations as part of this change lifo and metal price lag will be included in the operating income of the segments 

in conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting guidance on changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows effective january 1 2018 and to be applied retrospectively specifically as it relates to the requirement to reclassify cash received from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables from cash from operations to cash provided from investing activities the company has changed the calculation of its measure of free cash flow to cash from operations plus cash received from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables less capital expenditures this change to our measure of free cash flow is being implemented to ensure consistent presentation of this measure across all historical periods once the required accounting guidance reclassification is reflected in our financial results beginning in the first quarter of 2018 the adoption of this accounting change does not reflect a change in our underlying business or activities 

2016 separation transaction  on november 1 2016 the company completed the separation of its business into two standalone publiclytraded companies arconic inc and alcoa corporation following the separation transaction arconic comprises the global rolled products other than the rolling mill in warrick indiana and the 251 equity ownership stake in the ma’aden rolling company the engineered products and solutions and the transportation and construction solutions segments alcoa corporation comprises the alumina and primary metals segments the rolling mill in warrick indiana and the 251 equity ownership stake in the ma’aden rolling company in saudi arabia

results of operations 

earnings summary 

sales— sales for 2017  were 12960  compared with sales of 12394  in 2016  an increase  of 566  or 5  the increase was the result of strong volume growth in all segments and higher aluminum pricing partially offset by the planned ramp down and toll processing agreement relating to the company’s north america packaging business in tennessee in the global rolled products segment as well as unfavorable product pricing in both the engineered products and solutions and global rolled products segments pursuant to the toll processing agreement that arconic entered into with alcoa corporation on october 31 2016 in connection with the separation transaction arconic provides can body stock to alcoa corporation using aluminum supplied by alcoa corporation resulting in the absence of metal sales in 2017 compared to 2016 

sales for 2016 were 12394 compared with sales of 12413 in 2015 a decline of 19 or less than 1 the relatively flat performance was the result of a fullyear effect of two 2015 acquisitions in the engineered products and solutions segment and automotive volume increases in the global rolled products segment which were more than offset by the rampdown of the tennessee packaging business and the impact of aluminum prices in the global rolled products segment and unfavorable product price and mix across all segments 

cost of goods sold cogs— cogs as a percentage of sales was 799  in 2017  compared with 792  in 2016  the increase was primarily attributable to cost increases including net higher aluminum prices of 84 and rampup costs related to new commercial aerospace engines and a lower margin product mix partially offset by net cost savings 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 792 in 2016 compared with 814 in 2015 the primary drivers in the improvement in cogs as a percentage of sales were productivity gains across all segments and higher volume in the engineered products and solutions segment due to the benefit of a fullyear effect of two 2015 acquisitions this benefit was somewhat offset by overall cost increases across all segments and unfavorable product pricing and mix impacts primarily in the engineered products and solutions and global rolled products segments 

selling general administrative and other expenses sga —  sga expenses were 731  or 56  of sales in 2017  compared with 942  or 76  of sales in 2016  the decrease  in sga was the result of expenses related to the separation transaction of 193 in 2016 compared to 18 in 2017 as well as ongoing overhead cost reduction efforts see restructuring and other charges below partially offset by proxy advisory and governancerelated costs of 58 external legal and other advisory costs related to grenfell tower of 14 and costs associated with the company’s delaware reincorporation of 3 in 2017 

 

sga expenses were 942 or 76 of sales in 2016 compared with 765 or 62 of sales in 2015 the increase in sga was primarily due to costs related to the separation transaction of 193 in 2016 an increase of 169 from 2015 separation costs 

research and development expenses rd— rd expenses were 111  in 2017  compared with 132  in 2016  and 169  in 2015 the decrease in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven by lower spending the decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by the decrease in spending for the micromill™ in san antonio tx which was completed in 2015 and began production of automotive sheet on a limited basis for the global rolled products segment 

provision for depreciation and amortization da— the provision for da was 551  in 2017  compared with 535  in 2016  the increase  of 16  or 3  was primarily due to capital projects placed into service the provision for da was 535 in 2016 compared with 508 in 2015 the increase of 27 related to a full year of da related to two acquisitions which occurred during 2015 see engineered products and solutions under segment information below

arconic does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows   



interest expense— interest expense was 496  in 2017  compared with 499  in 2016  the decrease  of 3  or 1  was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from lower outstanding debt mostly offset by 73 primarily in higher premiums paid in 2017 related to the early redemption of 1250 in debt in the second quarter of 2017 arconic redeemed all of the company’s 650 bonds due 2018 and 675 notes due 2018 and a portion of the company’s 572 notes due 2019 in advance of the respective maturity dates 

interest expense was 499 in 2016 compared with 473 in 2015 the increase of 26 or 5 was primarily due to debt issuance costs of 9 that were expensed in connection with the separation transaction and costs associated with the early redemption of 750 of 555 notes due february 2017 completed on december 30 2016 which included a 3 purchase premium and a fullyear of interest related to rti international metals inc rti debt of 6 

other income net— other income net was 640  in 2017  compared with 94  in 2016  the increase of 546  was   primarily due to the gain on the sale of a portion of arconic’s investment in alcoa corporation common stock of 351 in february 2017 the company sold 23353000 shares of alcoa corporation stock at 3803 per share which resulted in cash proceeds of 888 and a gain of 351 and the gain of 167 on the debtforequity exchange in april and may 2017 the company acquired a portion of its outstanding notes held by two investment banks the “investment banks” in exchange for cash and the company’s remaining 12958767 shares valued at 3591 per share in alcoa corporation stock and recorded a gain of 167 income of 25 associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earnout liability related to the firth rixson acquisition see note f to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information and income of 25 due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separationrelated guarantee the company was required to provide a guarantee for an alcoa corporation electricity contract in the event of an alcoa corporation payment default in the fourth quarter of 2017 alcoa corporation announced that it had terminated the electricity contract at its rockdale operations and as a result arconic reversed its associated guarantee liability 

other income net was 94 in 2016 compared with 28 in 2015 the increase of 66 was mainly the result of a favorable adjustment to the contingent earnout liability and a postclosing adjustment both of which related to the acquisition of firth rixson of 76 and favorable foreign currency movements of 55 these items were partially offset by the absence of gains on the sales of land in the united states and an equity investment in a china rolling mill of 38 in 2015 

income taxes— arconic’s effective tax rate was 1157 in 2017 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate primarily differs from the us federal statutory rate as a result of a 719 impairment of goodwill a 41 impairment of assets in the latin america extrusions business and a 60 charge related to the sale of a rolling mill in italy that are nondeductible for income tax purposes a 272 tax charge as a provisional impact of the 2017 act and a 23 tax charge for an increase in an uncertain tax position in germany partially offset by a 73 tax benefit related to the sale and debtforequity exchange of the alcoa corporation stock a 69 tax benefit for the release of us state valuation allowances net of the federal tax benefit a 27 favorable tax impact associated with a nontaxable earnout liability adjustment in connection with the firth rixson acquisition and by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions 

arconic’s effective tax rate was 3565 in 2016 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a 1267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the separation transaction see income taxes under critical accounting policies and estimates below a 95 tax charge associated with the redemption of companyowned life insurance policies whose tax basis was less than the redemption amount resulting in a taxable gain a 51 net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate and tax law changes and a 34 unfavorable tax impact related to certain separation costs which are nondeductible for income tax purposes somewhat offset by a 39 discrete income tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances in canada and russia a 38 tax benefit related to currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income and a 26 favorable tax impact associated with nontaxable settlement proceeds and earnout liability adjustments in connection with the firth rixson acquisition 

arconic’s effective tax rate was 1852 in 2015 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to a 190 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the us and iceland see income taxes under critical accounting policies and estimates below a 25 impairment of goodwill that is nondeductible for income tax purposes a loss on the sale of a rolling mill in russia for which no tax benefit was recognized and a 34 net discrete income tax charge as described below 

in 2015 alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac the former joint venture owned 60 by arconic and 40 by alumina limited recognized an 85 discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in suriname see income taxes under critical accounting policies and estimates below which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards arconic also had a 51 deferred tax liability related to its 60share of these deferred tax assets that was written off as a result of the valuation allowance recognized by awac 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2018 will be between 27 and 29 however business portfolio actions changes in the current economic environment tax legislation or rate changes currency fluctuations ability to realize deferred tax assets movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stockbased payment awards and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate it is also expected that continuing analysis of the 2017 act as well as additional guidance as it is issued will have an impact on the estimated rate 

loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests— loss   from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 74  for 2017  or 028  per diluted share compared to 1062  for 2016  or 258  per share the increase  in results of 988  was primarily attributable to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the separation transaction in 2016 a gain of 238 351 pretax on the sale of a portion of arconic’s investment in alcoa corporation common stock and a gain of 167 167 pretax on the debtforequity exchange in 2017 income of 25 25 pretax associated with a higher reversal of a contingent earnout liability related to the firth rixson acquisition and income of 16 25 pretax due to the reversal of a liability associated with a separationrelated guarantee net cost savings and higher sales volumes across all segments partially offset by a charge for goodwill impairment of 719 719 pretax a charge related to the 2017 act of 272 47 73 pretax of higher premiums paid for the early redemption of debt in 2017 higher lifo inventory expense associated with higher aluminum prices charges for asset impairments of the fusina italy rolling mill of 60 60 pretax and latin america extrusions business of 41 41 pretax based on the sale of these businesses unfavorable product pricing primarily in aerospace and lowermargin product mix 

loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 1062 for 2016 or 258 per diluted share compared to 157 for 2015 or 054 per share the decrease in results of 905 was primarily due to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the separation transaction primarily offset by a fullyear effect of 2015 acquisitions see engineered products and solutions under segment information below and net cost savings across all segments

depreciation and amortization “adjusted ebitda” segment performance under arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance in 2017 was adjusted ebitda arconic’s definition of adjusted ebitda is net margin plus an addback for depreciation and amortization net margin is equivalent to sales minus the following items cost of goods sold selling general administrative and other expenses research and development expenses and provision for depreciation and amortization prior period information has been recast to conform to current year presentation the adjusted ebitda presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies certain items are excluded from segment adjusted ebitda such as impairment of goodwill restructuring and other charges the impact of lifo inventory accounting metal price lag the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment  generally when the price of metal increases metal price lag is favorable and when the price of metal decreases metal price lag is unfavorable corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities and corporate research and development expenses and other items including intersegment profit eliminations 

beginning in the first quarter of 2018 the companys primary measure of segment performance will change from adjusted ebitda to operating income which more closely aligns segment performance with operating income as presented in the statement of consolidated operations as part of this change lifo and metal price lag will be included in the operating income of the segments 

adjusted ebitda for all reportable segments totaled 2144  in 2017  2063  in 2016  and 1894 in 2015  the following information provides sales and adjusted ebitda for each reportable segment as well as certain shipment and realized price data for global rolled products for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2017  see note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment increase d 207  or 4  in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily attributable to volume growth in both aerospace engines and airframes partially offset by lower product pricing primarily in the aerospace end market and the absence of sales of 23 related to the remmele medical business which was sold in april 2016 

thirdparty sales for this segment increase d 386  or 7  in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily attributable to higher thirdparty sales of the two acquired businesses of 457 primarily related to the aerospace end market and increased demand from the industrial gas turbine end market partially offset by lower volumes in the oil and gas end market and commercial transportation end market as well as pricing pressures in aerospace 

adjusted ebitda for the engineered products and solutions segment increase d 29 or 2 in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily on higher volumes and net cost savings partially offset by product pricing pressures ramp up costs associated with increasing production volumes of new aerospace engine parts and a lower margin product mix 

adjusted ebitda for this segment increase d 84 or 8  in 2016  compared with 2015    primarily on net cost savings across all businesses as well as the volume increase from both the rti acquisition and organic revenue growth partially offset by a lower margin product mix and pricing pressures in the aerospace end market 

in 2018 demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong driven by the rampup of new aerospace engine platforms demand in the defense end market is expected to grow due to the continuing rampup of certain aerospace programs additionally net cost savings are anticipated while declines in the industrial gas turbine market and pricing pressure across all markets is likely to continue 

global rolled products 1   



 the global rolled products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace automotive commercial transportation packaging building and construction and industrial products mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables end markets a small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers generally the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are mostly the us dollar chinese yuan the euro the russian ruble the brazilian real and the british pound

thirdparty sales for the global rolled products segment increase d 128 or 3 in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily attributable to volume growth in the automotive end market and higher aluminum pricing partially offset by the impact of 362 associated with the rampdown and toll processing agreement with alcoa corporation at the company’s north america packaging business in tennessee the absence of sales of 111 from the rolling mill in fusina italy aerospace customer inventory destocking and reduced build rates and pricing pressures in the global packaging market 

thirdparty sales for this segment decrease d 389  or 7  in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the rampdown of tennessee packaging of 251 lower aluminum prices and lower demand in the industrial products packaging commercial aerospace commercial transportation and north american heavy duty truck markets these decreases were partially offset by higher volume in the automotive market 

adjusted ebitda for the global rolled products segment increase d 22 or 4 in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily driven by net cost savings and increased automotive volumes partially offset by lower aerospace volume from customer destocking and reduced build rates continued pricing pressure on global packaging products and higher aluminum prices the higher aluminum prices negatively impacted the global rolled products adjusted ebitda margin by 18 or 140 basis points in 2017 compared with 2016 

adjusted ebitda for this segment increase d 65 or 13 in 2016  compared with 2015    primarily driven by strong productivity improvements which significantly exceeded cost increases partially offset by lower pricing primarily due to overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet market unfavorable product mix and lower volumes as detailed above 

in 2018 demand in the automotive end market is expected to continue to grow due to the growing demand for innovative products and aluminumintensive vehicles demand from the commercial airframe end market is expected to be flat in 2018 as the rampup of new programs is offset by lower build rates for aluminum intensive widebody programs the rampdown of the north american packaging operations is expected to continue in 2018 net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue

thirdparty sales for the transportation and construction solutions segment increase d 183  or 10  in 2017  compared with 2016  primarily driven by increased volumes in the commercial transportation and building and construction end markets higher aluminum pricing and favorable foreign currency movements partially offset by lower product pricing 

thirdparty sales for this segment decrease d 80  or 4  in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by lower demand from the north american commercial transportation end market which was partially offset by rising demand from the building and construction end market 

adjusted ebitda for the transportation and construction solutions segment increase d 30 or 10 in 2017  compared with 2016  principally driven by net cost savings and higher volumes partially offset by lower product pricing in the heavyduty truck market unfavorable product mix and higher aluminum prices the higher aluminum prices negatively impacted the transportation and construction solutions adjusted ebitda margin by 19 or 120 basis points in 2017 compared with 2016 

adjusted ebitda for this segment increase d 20 or 7  in 2016  compared with 2015  principally driven by net cost savings across all businesses and growth in the building and construction segment partially offset by lower demand in the north american heavy duty truck and brazilian markets

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters the testing of goodwill other intangible assets and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

environmental matters  expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters  for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

goodwill  goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or realign a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity 

operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment arconic has eight  reporting units of which four  are included in the engineered products and solutions segment three  are included in the transportation and construction solutions segment and the remaining reporting unit is the global rolled products segment more than 85  of arconic’s total goodwill at december 31 2017  is allocated to two  reporting units as follows arconic fastening systems and rings afsr  2221  and arconic power and propulsion app  1686  businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment these amounts include an allocation of corporate’s goodwill 

in january 2018 management announced a change in the organizational structure of the engineered products and solutions segment from four business units to three business units with a focus on aligning its internal structure to core markets and customers and reducing cost as a result of this change goodwill will be reallocated to the three new reporting units and evaluated for impairment during the first quarter of 2018 the company does not expect any goodwill impairment as a result of this realignment 

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test 

arconic determines annually based on facts and circumstances which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment for those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not a quantitative impairment test will be performed arconic’s policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2017 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for one reporting unit arconic wheel and transportation products within the transportation and construction solutions segment management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value as such no further analysis was required 

under the quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill arconic uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices production costs tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the wacc rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit 

during the 2017  annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for six  reporting units as follows afsr app arconic titanium and engineered products atep and arconic forgings and extrusions afe which are all included in the engineered products and solutions segment global rolled products and building and construction systems which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment the estimated fair value for five of the six reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value resulting in no impairment however the 

estimated fair value of afe was lower than its carrying value as such in the fourth quarter of 2017 arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the afe reporting unit of 719 the decrease in the afe fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that is impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the riskfree rate of return while the carrying value increased compared to prior year 

goodwill impairment tests in 2016 and 2015 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units except for the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment in the fourth quarter of 2015 for the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value of its reporting unit’s goodwill as a result management determined that the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill was zero  arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of 25 in 2015 the impairment of goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn in the brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies as a result of the goodwill impairment there is no goodwill remaining for the reporting unit 

properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets  properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale  the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits  liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking industrials transportation and utilities among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 11 years the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2017  2016  and 2015  the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 375  420  and 429  respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 225 and either a charge or credit of approximately 3 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

in conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2015 management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond previously the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations under the new methodology the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate referred to as the “spot rate” approach this change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology in 2017 and 2016 of 34 and 84 respectively for pension plans and 6 and 14 respectively for other postretirement benefit plans management believes this new methodology which represents a change in an accounting estimate is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns the assumption represents a longterm prospective return management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2017  2016  and 2015  management used 775  as its expected longterm rate of return which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class these rates fell within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class in 2015 the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20year moving average of actual performance for 2018  management anticipates that 700 will be the expected longterm rate of return the decrease of 75 basis points in the expected longterm rate is due to a decrease in the expected return by asset class and the 20year moving average 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 9 for 2018  

in 2017 a net loss of 220 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the discount rate of 45 basis points and asset performance less than expected which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses in 2016 a net benefit of 1601 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the transfer of 2080 to alcoa corporation which was partially offset by a net charge of 479 the charge was due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets and a 9 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses in 2015 a net charge of 10 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets which was mostly offset by the amortization of actuarial losses and a 29 basis point increase in the discount rate 

in january 2018 the company announced the freeze of its us defined benefit pension plans for salaried and nonbargained hourly employees effective april 1 2018 benefit accruals for future service and compensation under all of the company’s qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans for us salaried and nonbargained hourly employees the “pension plans” will cease in connection with this change effective april 1 2018 impacted employees will commence receiving an employer contribution of 3 of eligible compensation under the arconic salaried retirement savings plan and for the period from april 1 2018 through december 31 2018 an additional transition employer contribution of 3 of eligible compensation 

as a result of this change to the pension plans in the first quarter of 2018 the company expects to record a liability decrease of approximately 140 related to the reduction of future benefits and a curtailment charge of approximately 5 pretax for the full year 2018 the company expects pensionrelated expense to be lower by approximately 50 pretax compared to 2017 full year expenses the lower pension expense expectation is based on preliminary yearend december 31 2017 results and is inclusive of the change to the pension plans described above as well as expected changes in other pensionrelated assumptions 

additionally in accordance with accounting guidance effective january 1 2018 that requires the other components of net periodic benefit cost to be presented separately from the service cost component approximately 110 of pensionrelated expense in 2018 is expected to be recorded in the other income net line item in the statement of consolidated operations 

stockbased compensation  arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value forfeitures are accounted for as they occur the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model the fair value of performance awards containing a market condition is valued using a monte carlo valuation model determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

as part of arconic’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2017  2016  and 2015  was 54   36  aftertax 76   51  aftertax and 77   51  aftertax respectively of these amounts 15  19  and 15  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes  the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and arconic’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

in 2017 arconic released 98  of certain us state valuation allowances after weighing all available positive and negative evidence management determined that the underlying net deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable based on projected taxable income estimates taking into account expected postseparation apportionment data valuation allowances of 750  remain against other net state deferred tax assets expected to expire before utilization the need for valuation allowances against net state deferred tax assets will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances 

arconic also recorded an additional valuation allowance of 675 which offsets additional losses reported on the spanish tax return filed in 2017 related to the separation transaction that are not more likely than not to be realized there is no net impact to the provision for income taxes as the additional valuation allowance fully offsets the current year tax benefit in spain  

arconic’s foreign tax credits in the united states have a 10year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2018 to 2027 as of december 31 2017 valuation allowances were initially established in prior years on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period after consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies and earnings of foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends incremental valuation allowances of 302 and 134 were recognized in 2016 and 2015 respectively foreign tax credits of 57 128 and 15 expired at the end of 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance during 2017 an additional valuation allowance of 23  was recorded for current year excess foreign tax credits offset by a net 14 reduction for other adjustments at december 31 2017 the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was 379  the need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances including the impact of the 2017 act 

arconic will continue its analysis of the 2017 act including any additional guidance that may be issued further analysis could result in changes to assumptions related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets including but not limited to foreign tax credits alternative minimum tax credits and state tax loss carryforwards provisional estimates of the impact of the 2017 act on the realizability of certain deferred tax assets have been made based on information and computations that were available prepared and analyzed as of february 2 2018 in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act issued by the securities and exchange commission arconic will reassess the need for valuation allowances on these deferred tax assets as necessary during 2018 

in 2016 arconic recognized a 1267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the separation transaction including 925 with respect to alcoa corporation’s net deferred tax assets in the united states 302 with respect to arconic’s foreign tax credits in the united states 42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in luxembourg and 2 related to the net impact of other smaller items after weighing all positive and negative evidence as described above 

management determined that the net deferred tax assets of alcoa corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income as such a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to separation 

in addition arconic recognized a 42 discrete income tax charge in 2016 for a valuation allowance on the full value of certain net deferred tax assets in luxembourg sources of taxable income which previously supported the net deferred tax asset are no longer available as a result of the separation transaction the need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances 

in 2016 arconic also recognized discrete income tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets in russia and canada of 19 and 20 respectively after weighing all available evidence management determined that it was more likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historical cumulative income and projected taxable income 

arconic also recorded additional valuation allowances in australia of 93 related to the separation transaction in spain of 163 related to a tax law change and in luxembourg of 280 related to the separation transaction as well as a tax law change these valuation allowances fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction resulting in no net impact to tax expense the need for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each jurisdiction and as a result the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances 

in 2015 arconic recognized an additional 141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in iceland and suriname of this amount an 85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in suriname which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022 as of december 31 2015 the remaining 56 charge relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in iceland these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023 after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that arconic will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

competitive conditions 

global rolled products grp 

grp is one of the leaders in many of the aluminum flat rolled products markets in which it participates including aerospace automotive brazing sheet commercial transportation industrial markets and regional specialties however much like other arconic businesses grp is subject to substantial and intense competition in all of its markets 

while grp participates in markets where arconic believes the company has a significant competitive advantage due to customer intimacy advanced manufacturing capability andor differentiated products in certain cases the company’s competitors are capable of making products similar to arconic’s the company continuously works to maintain and enhance its competitive advantage through innovation new alloys such as arconic’s new aerospace alloys new products such as the company’s 5 layer brazing products and breakthrough processes such as arconic micromill™ technology 

grp comprises aap bci and mps each serving defined segments some of the markets are worldwide and some are more regionally focused participation in these segments by grp’s competitors varies for example novelis is the largest flat rolled products producer but does not participate in the aerospace market on the other hand constellium participates in all major market segments including aerospace brazing industrial commercial transportation and packaging granges participates only in the brazing sheet market other grp competitors include aleris amag kaiser kobe nanshan and uacj 

additionally there are a number of new competitors emerging particularly in china and other developing economies for example in the brazing business the number of viable competitors has doubled over a fiveyear period arconic expects that this competitive pressure will continue and increase in the future as customers seek to globalize their supply bases in order to reduce costs the company continually monitors and plans for these new emerging players

 item 1a risk factors tableend arconic’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business financial condition or results of operations including causing arconic’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to arconic or that arconic currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company in future periods 

the markets for arconic’s products are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

arconic is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and lightweight metals enduse markets arconic sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the aerospace automotive and commercial construction and transportation industries and the demand for its products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in regional or worldwide economies currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond its control 

in particular arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from products sold to the aerospace industry which can be highly cyclical and reflective of changes in the general economy the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft the us and international commercial aviation industries may face challenges arising from competitive pressures and fuel costs demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability trends in airline passenger traffic the state of us regional and world economies the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism health and safety concerns environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding however it is also driven by the effects of terrorism a changing global political environment us foreign policy the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines 

further the demand for arconic’s automotive and ground transportation products is driven by the number of vehicles produced by automotive manufacturers and arconic content per vehicle the automotive industry is sensitive to general economic conditions including credit markets and interest rates and consumer spending and preferences regarding vehicle ownership and usage vehicle size configuration and features automotive sales and production can also be affected by other factors including the age of the vehicle fleet and related scrappage rates labor relations issues fuel prices regulatory requirements government initiatives trade agreements and levels of competition 

  

while arconic believes that the longterm prospects for its products are positive the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables the strength of the us regional or global economies or the effects of government intervention negative economic conditions such as a major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business financial condition or results of operations 

arconic’s business could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of aluminum 

arconic derives a significant portion of its revenue from aluminumbased products the price of primary aluminum has historically been subject to significant cyclical price fluctuations and the timing of changes in the market price of aluminum is largely unpredictable although the company’s pricing of products is generally intended to pass the risk of metal price fluctuations on to the company’s customers arconic may not be able to pass on the entire cost of increases to its customers and there can be a potential time lag on certain products between increases in costs for aluminum and the point when the company can implement a corresponding increase in price to its customers as a result arconic may be exposed to such price fluctuations during the time lag if this occurs it could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

arconic’s customers may reduce their demand for aluminum products in favor of alternative materials 

certain applications of arconic’s aluminumbased products compete with products made from other materials such as steel titanium and composites the willingness of customers to pursue materials other than aluminum depends upon the desire to achieve specific attributes for example the commercial aerospace industry has used and continues to evaluate the further use of alternative materials to aluminum such as titanium and composites in order to reduce the weight and increase the fuel efficiency of aircraft additionally the automotive industry while motivated to reduce vehicle weight through the use of aluminum may revert to steel or other materials for certain applications further the decision to use aluminum may be impacted by aluminum prices the willingness of customers to accept other materials in lieu of aluminum could adversely affect the demand for certain of arconic’s products and thus adversely affect arconic’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

arconic’s profitability could be adversely affected by volatility in the availability or cost of raw materials 

arconic’s results of operations may be affected by changes in the availability or cost of raw materials as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials the availability and costs of certain raw materials necessary for the production of arconic’s products may be influenced by private or government cartels changes in world politics or regulatory requirements labor relations between the producers and their work forces unstable governments in exporting nations export quotas new or increased import duties market forces of supply and demand and inflation in addition from time to time commodity prices may fall rapidly when this happens suppliers may withdraw capacity from the market until prices improve which may cause periodic supply interruptions arconic may not be able to fully offset the effects of raw material shortages or higher costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s operating results 

arconic could encounter manufacturing difficulties which could affect arconic’s reputation business and financial statements 

the manufacture of many of arconic’s products is a highly exacting and complex process problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with raw materials supply chain interruptions natural disasters labor unrest and environmental factors such problems could have an adverse impact on the company’s ability to fulfill orders or on product performance product manufacturing issues could result in recalls customer penalties contract cancellation and product liability exposure because of approval and license requirements applicable to manufacturers andor their 

  

suppliers alternatives to mitigate manufacturing disruptions may not be readily available to the company or its customers accordingly manufacturing problems could result in significant costs to and liability for arconic as well as negative publicity and damage to the company’s reputation which could impact product demand 

arconic’s business depends in part on its ability to successfully meet increased program demand and mitigate the impact of program cancellations reductions and delays 

the success of arconic’s aerospace business will depend in part on the success of commercial and military aircraft programs arconic is currently under contract to supply components for a number of new and existing commercial general aviation and military aircraft programs many of these programs are scheduled for production increases over the next several years arconic’s failure to successfully meet production levels could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business similarly cancellations reductions or delays could also have a material adverse effect on arconic’s business 

arconic could be adversely affected by reductions in defense spending 

arconic’s products are used in a variety of military applications including military aircraft and armored vehicles although many of the programs in which arconic participates extend several years they are subject to annual funding through congressional appropriations changes in military strategy and priorities or reductions in defense spending may affect current and future funding of these programs and could reduce the demand for arconic’s products which could adversely affect arconic’s financial position results of operations and cash flows 

arconic’s global operations expose the company to risks that could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

arconic has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states including europe brazil canada china japan and russia the company’s global operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 while the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect arconic’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events 

arconic may face challenges to its intellectual property rights which could adversely affect the company’s reputation business and financial position 

arconic owns important intellectual property including patents trademarks copyrights and trade secrets the company’s intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining arconic’s competitive position in a number of the markets that the company serves arconic’s competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to arconic’s proprietary technologies or design around the patents arconic owns or licenses further as the company expands its operations in jurisdictions where the enforcement of intellectual property rights is less robust the risk of 

  

others duplicating arconic’s proprietary technologies increases despite efforts the company undertakes to protect them developments or assertions by or against arconic relating to intellectual property rights and any inability to protect or enforce these rights could adversely affect arconic’s business and competitive position 

arconic is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which arconic operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect arconic’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies including the british pound chinese yuan renminbi euro and russian ruble may affect arconic’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies while the company’s products are generally sold in us dollars 

arconic may not be able to realize the expected benefits from its strategy of growing its precision engineering and advanced manufacturing businesses 

arconic is continuing to execute on its strategy of growing its precision engineering and advanced manufacturing business to capture profitable growth as a lightweight metals innovation leader it is investing in its manufacturing and engineering businesses to capture growth opportunities in strong end markets like automotive and aerospace arconic is building out its businesses including by introducing innovative new products and technology solutions and investing in expansions of capacity arconic’s recent organic growth projects include the automotive expansions in davenport iowa and alcoa tennessee the aluminum lithium capacity expansion in lafayette indiana at the arconic technology center in pennsylvania and at the kitts green plant in the united kingdom and the expansion in aerospace capabilities in la porte indiana hampton virginia and davenport iowa from time to time arconic also pursues growth opportunities that are strategically aligned with its objectives such as the acquisition of the firth rixson business completed in november 2014 the acquisition of tital completed in march 2015 and the acquisition of rti international metals completed in july 2015 in addition arconic is optimizing its rolling mill portfolio as part of its strategy for profitable growth 

arconic has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio although management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to arconic there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized adverse factors may prevent arconic from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines acquisitions present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company unanticipated costs and liabilities and the ability to realize anticipated benefits such as growth in market share revenue or margins at the levels or in the timeframe expected the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully 

with respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures curtailments and closures arconic may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders in addition arconic may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments arconic’s business operations are capital intensive and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges including employee separation costs asset impairment charges and other measures 

there can be no assurance that acquisitions growth investments divestitures or closures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to arconic 

arconic may not be able to successfully realize future targets or goals established for its business segments at the levels or by the dates targeted 

from time to time arconic may announce future targets or goals for its business which are based on the company’s then current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the operating environment economies and markets in which arconic operates future targets and goals reflect the company’s beliefs and assumptions and its perception 

  

of historical trends then current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances as such targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events including the risks discussed in this report the actual outcome may be materially different there can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all failure to achieve the targets or goals by the company may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations or the market price of its securities 

arconic faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1 business—competitive conditions of this report the markets for arconic’s products are highly competitive arconic’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets new product offerings or new technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace arconic products the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by arconic the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for arconic’s products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting arconic’s competitors or customers could affect arconic’s results of operations in addition arconic’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its businesses and key end markets 

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings could limit arconic’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs increase the pricing of its credit facilities adversely affect the market price of its securities trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

arconic’s credit ratings are important to the company’s cost of capital the major rating agencies routinely evaluate arconic’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to the company this evaluation is based on a number of factors which include financial strength business and financial risk as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting standard and poor’s ratings services sp currently rates arconic’s longterm debt at bbb the lowest level of investment grade rating with a stable ratings outlook and its shortterm debt at a3 ratings and outlook were affirmed on april 29 2016 and september 19 2016 on november 1 2016 moody’s investor service moody’s downgraded arconic’s longterm debt rating from ba1 which is below investment grade to ba2 and its shortterm debt rating from speculative grade liquidity rating1 to speculative grade liquidity2 based upon the completion of the separation additionally moody’s changed the outlook from negative to stable on april 21 2016 fitch affirmed arconic’s longterm debt rating at bb which is below investment grade and shortterm debt at b additionally fitch changed the current outlook from positive to evolving on july 7 2016 fitch changed the current outlook from evolving to stable based on the filing of a form 10 registration statement related to the planned separation of alcoa corporation from arconic 

there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to arconic’s ratings increased debt levels macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

a downgrade of arconic’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of arconic’s securities adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by standard and poor’s or a further downgrade by moody’s would subject arconic to higher costs under arconic’s fiveyear revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from arconic or otherwise impair arconic’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

arconic may participate in joint ventures strategic alliance and other similar arrangements from time to time although the company has in connection with its existing joint venture sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks whether or not arconic holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

  

  

  

 there can be no assurance that any arconic joint venture or strategic alliance will be beneficial to the company whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

arconic’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures 

arconic requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact arconic’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and returnseeking capital projects over the long term arconic’s ability to take advantage of improved market conditions or growth opportunities in its businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions which could adversely affect the longterm value of its business and the company’s position in relation to its competitors 

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect arconic’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

arconic’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense arconic records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors arconic calculates income or expense for its plans using actuarial valuations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by arconic to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition arconic is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how arconic’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note u to the consolidated financial statements—pension and other postretirement benefits in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities arconic would contribute to the pension plans 

potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act “map 21” enacted in 2012 provided temporary relief for employers like arconic who sponsor defined benefit pension plans 

  

related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations in 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law hatfa extended the relief provided by map21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map21 in 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 bba 2015 was signed into law bba 2015 extends the relief period provided by hafta arconic believes that the relief provided by bba 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years however higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the company’s cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans which could adversely affect arconic’s liquidity and results of operations 

unanticipated changes in arconic’s tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect arconic’s future profitability 

arconic is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect the company’s tax expense and profitability arconic’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions significant changes to the us corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact positive or negative on arconic’s effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect arconic’s financial results 

a significant portion of arconic’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1 business of this report while arconic was previously successful in renegotiating its collective bargaining agreements with various unions arconic may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at arconic’s facilities in the future arconic may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s financial results 

arconic could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition or the loss of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition or loss of a key customer or customers supplied by arconic could affect arconic’s results of operations in a particular period arconic’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses arconic’s customers may also change their business strategies or modify their business relationships with arconic including to reduce the amount of arconic’s products they purchase or to switch to alternative suppliers if arconic is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

  

arconic may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

arconic is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments including additive manufacturing alloy development engineered finishes and product design high speed continuous casting and rolling technology and other advanced manufacturing technologies for more information on arconic’s research and development programs see “research and development” in part i item 1 business of this report there can be no assurance that such developments or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to arconic 

arconic’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

arconic’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company or the industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact arconic’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

arconic may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

arconic has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including deployment of companywide business process models such as arconic’s degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings and overhead cost reductions there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to arconic or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

arconic may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to arconic the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws antibribery laws competition laws and sales and trading practices arconic could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts 

while arconic believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note l to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

arconic is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

arconic’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which arconic may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by the company sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future compliance with environmental health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than the company anticipates arconic’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

arconic may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market responses to such change 

increased concern over climate change has led to new and proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives such as capandtrade systems and additional limits on emissions of greenhouse gases new laws enacted could directly and indirectly affect arconic’s customers and suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or business through an impact on arconic’s inventory availability cost of sales operations or demand for arconic products which could result in an adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws could require additional expenditures by the company or its customers or suppliers also arconic relies on natural gas electricity fuel oil and transport fuel to operate its facilities any increased costs of these energy sources because of new laws could be passed along to the company and its customers and suppliers which could also have a negative impact on arconic’s profitability 

cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of arconic’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

arconic faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on arconic’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact arconic’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased 

  

remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and result in the diminution of the value of the company’s investment in research and development 

antitakeover provisions could prevent or delay a change in control of arconic including a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of arconic’s shareholders 

arconic’s articles of incorporation and bylaws contain and pennsylvania law contains provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with arconic’s board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover for example arconic is subject to subchapters ej of chapter 25 and section 2538 of subchapter d of chapter 25 of the pennsylvania business corporation law which could make it more difficult for another party to acquire arconic additionally the company’s articles of incorporation authorize arconic’s board of directors to issue preferred stock or adopt other antitakeover measures without shareholder approval these provisions may apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that arconic’s board of directors determines is not in the best interests of arconic’s shareholders these provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of arconic common stock or prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors 

dividends on arconic common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the event of material future deterioration in business conditions or in other circumstances 

the existence timing declaration amount and payment of future dividends to arconic’s shareholders falls within the discretion of arconic’s board of directors the arconic board of director’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends will depend on many factors such as arconic’s financial condition earnings capital requirements debt service obligations covenants associated with certain of the company’s debt service obligations industry practice legal requirements regulatory constraints and other factors that arconic’s board of directors deems relevant arconic’s board of directors may determine to reduce or eliminate arconic’s common stock dividend in the event of material future deteriorations in business conditions 

arconic may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and failure to realize such benefits in a timely manner may materially adversely affect arconic’s business 

arconic may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the separation or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all the separation is expected to provide the following benefits among others i enabling the management of each company to more effectively pursue its own distinct operating priorities and strategies to focus on strengthening its core business and its unique needs and to pursue distinct and targeted opportunities for longterm growth and profitability ii permitting each company to allocate its financial resources to meet the unique needs of its own business allowing each company to intensify its focus on its distinct strategic priorities and to more effectively pursue its own distinct capital structures and capital allocation strategies iii allowing each company to more effectively articulate a clear investment thesis to attract a longterm investor base suited to its business and providing investors with two distinct and targeted investment opportunities iv creating an independent equity currency tracking each company’s underlying business affording arconic and alcoa corporation direct access to the capital markets and facilitating each company’s ability to consummate future acquisitions or other restructuring transactions utilizing its common stock v allowing each company more consistent application of incentive structures and targets due to the common nature of the underlying businesses and vi separating and simplifying the structures required to manage two distinct and differing underlying businesses 

arconic may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons including among others i arconic may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if alcoa corporation were still a part of the company because arconic’s business is less diversified than it was prior to the completion of the separation and ii as a smaller independent company arconic may be unable to obtain certain goods services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those it obtained prior to completion of the separation if arconic 

  

fails to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the separation or if such benefits are delayed it could have a material adverse effect on arconic’s competitive position business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

alcoa corporation may fail to perform under various transaction agreements that were executed as part of the separation 

in connection with the separation arconic and alcoa corporation entered into a separation and distribution agreement and also entered into various other agreements including a transition services agreement a tax matters agreement an employee matters agreement a stockholder and registration rights agreement with respect to arconic’s continuing ownership of alcoa corporation common stock intellectual property license agreements a metal supply agreement real estate and office leases a spare parts loan agreement and an agreement relating to the north american packaging business the separation and distribution agreement the tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement together with the documents and agreements by which the internal reorganization of the company prior to the separation was effected determined the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies following the separation for those respective areas and included any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations the separation and distribution agreement also provides that alcoa corporation will pay over to arconic the proceeds in respect of the sale of alcoa corporation’s yadkin hydroelectric project the transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time after the separation arconic will rely on alcoa corporation to satisfy its performance and payment obligations under these agreements if alcoa corporation is unable or unwilling to satisfy its obligations under these agreements including its indemnification obligations we could incur operational difficulties andor losses 

in connection with the separation alcoa corporation has agreed to indemnify arconic for certain liabilities and arconic has agreed to indemnify alcoa corporation for certain liabilities if arconic is required to pay under these indemnities to alcoa corporation arconic’s financial results could be negatively impacted the alcoa corporation indemnity may not be sufficient to hold arconic harmless from the full amount of liabilities for which alcoa corporation will be allocated responsibility and alcoa corporation may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation has agreed to indemnify arconic for certain liabilities and arconic has agreed to indemnify alcoa corporation for certain liabilities in each case for uncapped amounts indemnities that arconic may be required to provide alcoa corporation are not subject to any cap may be significant and could negatively impact arconic’s business third parties could also seek to hold arconic responsible for any of the liabilities that alcoa corporation has agreed to retain any amounts arconic is required to pay pursuant to these indemnification obligations and other liabilities could require arconic to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of the company’s operating business further the indemnity from alcoa corporation may not be sufficient to protect arconic against the full amount of such liabilities and alcoa corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which arconic is held liable arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses each of these risks could negatively affect arconic’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the separation could result in substantial tax liability 

it was a condition to the distribution that i the private letter ruling from the internal revenue service the “irs” regarding certain us federal income tax matters relating to the separation and the distribution received by arconic remain valid and be satisfactory to arconic’s board of directors and ii arconic receive an opinion of its outside counsel satisfactory to the board of directors regarding the qualification of the distribution together with certain related transactions as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” both of these conditions were 

  

satisfied prior to the distribution however the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel were based upon and relied on among other things various facts and assumptions as well as certain representations statements and undertakings of arconic and alcoa corporation including those relating to the past and future conduct of arconic and alcoa corporation if any of these representations statements or undertakings is or becomes inaccurate or incomplete or if arconic or alcoa corporation breaches any of its representations or covenants contained in any of the separation–related agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel may be invalid and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized 

notwithstanding arconic’s receipt of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel the irs could determine that the distribution andor certain related transactions should be treated as taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the representations assumptions or undertakings upon which the irs private letter ruling or the opinion of counsel was based are false or have been violated in addition the irs private letter ruling does not address all of the issues that are relevant to determining whether the distribution together with certain related transactions qualifies as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes and the opinion of counsel represents the judgment of such counsel and is not binding on the irs or any court and the irs or a court may disagree with the conclusions in the opinion of counsel accordingly notwithstanding receipt by arconic of the irs private letter ruling and the opinion of counsel there can be no assurance that the irs will not assert that the distribution andor certain related transactions do not qualify for taxfree treatment for us federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge in the event the irs were to prevail with such challenge arconic alcoa corporation and arconic shareholders could be subject to significant us federal income tax liability 

if the distribution together with certain related transactions fails to qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code in general for us federal income tax purposes arconic would recognize taxable gain as if it had sold the alcoa corporation common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value and arconic shareholders who received alcoa corporation shares in the distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under current us federal income tax law even if the distribution together with certain related transactions otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under sections 355 and 368a1d of the code the distribution may nevertheless be rendered taxable to arconic and its shareholders as a result of certain postdistribution transactions including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of arconic or alcoa corporation the possibility of rendering the distribution taxable as a result of such transactions may limit arconic’s ability to pursue certain equity issuances strategic transactions or other transactions that would otherwise maximize the value of arconic’s business under the tax matters agreement that arconic entered into with alcoa corporation alcoa corporation may be required to indemnify arconic against any additional taxes and related amounts resulting from i an acquisition of all or a portion of the equity securities or assets of alcoa corporation whether by merger or otherwise and regardless of whether alcoa corporation participated in or otherwise facilitated the acquisition ii issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds iii repurchasing shares of alcoa corporation stock other than in certain openmarket transactions iv ceasing to actively conduct certain of its businesses v other actions or failures to act by alcoa corporation or vi any of alcoa corporation’s representations covenants or undertakings contained in any of the separationrelated agreements and documents or in any documents relating to the irs private letter ruling andor the opinion of counsel being incorrect or violated however the indemnity from alcoa corporation may not be sufficient to protect arconic against the full amount of such additional taxes or related liabilities and alcoa corporation may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations moreover even if arconic ultimately succeeds in recovering from alcoa corporation any amounts for which arconic is held liable arconic may be temporarily required to bear such losses in addition arconic and arconic’s subsidiaries may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation including tax costs resulting from separations in nonus jurisdictions which may be material each of these risks could negatively affect arconic’s business results of operations and financial condition 

  

the value of arconic’s retained interest in alcoa corporation is subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could make it difficult to liquidate some or all of arconic’s retained interest at favorable market prices 

in the separation arconic retained a passive ownership interest in approximately 199 percent of alcoa corporation common stock then outstanding as of the date of this report arconic owned approximately 70 percent of alcoa corporation common stock then outstanding after giving effect to a retained shares transaction 

as with any investment in a publicly traded company arconic’s investment in alcoa corporation shares is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to alcoa corporation’s business and ownership of alcoa corporation stock some of which are disclosed in alcoa corporation’s filings with the sec as well as risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in the global economy and public equity markets generally 

any such risk or uncertainty may cause the share price of alcoa corporation common stock to fall which could impair arconic’s ability to sell its shares of alcoa corporation common stock in the future at a favorable market price or reduce the value of arconic’s retained interest in alcoa corporation 

changes in the united kingdom’s economic and other relationships with the european union could adversely affect arconic 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union in a national referendum also referred to as “brexit” the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic are difficult to predict but because the company currently operates and conducts business in the united kingdom and in europe the results of the referendum and any eventual withdrawal could cause disruptions and create uncertainty to arconic’s businesses including affecting the business of andor our relationships with arconic’s customers and suppliers as well as altering the relationship among tariffs and currencies including the value of the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar such disruptions and uncertainties could adversely affect arconic’s financial condition operating results and cash flows in addition brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the united kingdom and the european union are established the ultimate effects of brexit on arconic will also depend on the terms of any agreements the united kingdom and the european union make to retain access to each other’s respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently

as previously reported by an amended complaint filed april 21 2005 alcoa global fasteners inc now known as arconic global fasteners  rings inc was added as a defendant in orange county water district ocwd v northrop corporation et al civil action 04cc00715 superior court of california county of orange ocwd alleges contamination or threatened contamination of a drinking water aquifer by arconic certain of the entities that preceded arconic at the same locations as property owners andor operators and other current and former industrial and manufacturing businesses that operated in orange county in past decades ocwd seeks to recover the cost of aquifer remediation and attorney’s fees trial on statutory nonjury claims commenced on february 10 2012 on october 29

other matters 

as previously reported arconic inc and its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury as a result of occupational or other exposure to asbestos arconic its subsidiaries and former subsidiaries have numerous insurance policies over many years that provide coverage for asbestos related claims arconic has significant insurance coverage and believes that arconic’s reserves are adequate for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities the costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations cash flows and financial position of the company 

tax 

pursuant to the tax matters agreement dated as of october 31 2016 entered into between the company and alcoa corporation in connection with the separation the company shares responsibility with alcoa corporation for and alcoa corporation has agreed to partially indemnify the company with respect to the following matter 

as previously reported in september 2010 following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years an assessment was received as a result of spain’s tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a spanish consolidated tax group owned by the company an appeal of this assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court by the company was denied in october 2013 in december 2013 the company filed an appeal of the assessment in spain’s national court 

additionally following a corporate income tax audit of the same spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax years spain’s tax authorities issued an assessment in july 2013 similarly disallowing certain interest deductions in august 2013 the company filed an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court which was denied in january 2015 the company filed an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s national court in march 2015 

the combined assessments remeasured for a tax rate change enacted in november 2014 total 258 million € 246 million on january 16 2017 spain’s national court issued a decision in favor of the company related to the assessment received in september 2010 it is not yet known if spain’s tax authorities will appeal this decision spain’s national court has not yet rendered a decision related to the assessment received in july 2013 

the company believes it has meritorious arguments to support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through spain’s court system however in the event the company is unsuccessful a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available to the spanish consolidated tax group which would be shared between the company and alcoa corporation as provided for in the tax matters agreement additionally it is possible that the company may receive similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2009 at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an ultimate outcome for this matter 

matters previously reported – alcoa corporation 

we have included the matters discussed below in which the company remains party to proceedings relating to alcoa corporation in accordance with sec regulations the separation and distribution agreement dated october 31 2016 entered into between the company and alcoa corporation in connection with the separation provides for crossindemnities between the company and alcoa corporation for claims subject to indemnification the company does not expect any of such matters to result in a net claim against it 

squaw creek mine proceedings 

as previously reported in october 2006 in barnett et al v alcoa and alcoa fuels inc warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601pl499 41 plaintiffs sued arconic inc and a subsidiary asserting claims similar to those asserted in musgrave v alcoa et al warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87 

  

c010601ct006 in musgrave in january 2006 arconic inc and a subsidiary were sued by an individual on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated claiming harm from alleged exposure to waste that had been disposed in designated pits at the squaw creek mine in the 1970s in november 2007 arconic and its subsidiary filed a motion to dismiss the barnett cases in october 2008 the warrick county circuit court granted arconic’s motions to dismiss dismissing all claims arising out of alleged occupational exposure to wastes at the squaw creek mine but in november 2008 the trial court clarified its ruling indicating that the order does not dispose of plaintiffs’ personal injury claims based upon alleged “recreational” or nonoccupational exposure plaintiffs also filed a “second amended complaint” in response to the court’s orders granting arconic’s motion to dismiss on july 7 2010 the court granted the parties’ joint motions for a general continuance of trial settings discovery in this matter remains stayed the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss because plaintiffs have merely alleged that their medical condition is attributable to exposure to materials at the squaw creek mine but no further information is available due to the discovery stay 

st croix proceedings 

abednego and abraham cases  as previously reported on january 14 2010 arconic was served with a multiplaintiff action complaint involving several thousand individual persons claiming to be residents of st croix who are alleged to have suffered personal injury or property damage from hurricane georges or winds blowing material from the st croix alumina llc “sca” facility on the island of st croix us virgin islands since the time of the hurricane this complaint abednego et al v alcoa et al was filed in the superior court of the virgin islands st croix division following an unsuccessful attempt by arconic and sca to remove the case to federal court the case has been lodged in the superior court the complaint names as defendants the same entities that were sued in a february 1999 action arising out of the impact of hurricane georges on the island and added as a defendant the current owner of the alumina facility property 

also as previously reported on march 1 2012 arconic was served with a separate multiplaintiff action complaint involving approximately 200 individual persons alleging claims essentially identical to those set forth in the abednego v alcoa complaint this complaint abraham et al v alcoa et al was filed on behalf of plaintiffs previously dismissed in the federal court proceeding involving the original litigation over hurricane georges impacts the matter was originally filed in the superior court of the virgin islands st croix division on march 30 2011 

arconic and other defendants in the abraham and abednego cases filed or renewed motions to dismiss each case in march 2012 and august 2012 following service of the abraham complaint on arconic and remand of the abednego complaint to superior court respectively by order dated august 10 2015 the superior court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaints without prejudice to refile the complaints individually rather than as a multiplaintiff filing the order also preserves the defendants’ grounds for dismissal if new individual complaints are filed 

other contingencies 

in addition to the matters discussed above various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against arconic including those pertaining to environmental product liability safety and health and tax matters while the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that the company’s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on the financial position of the company

review of 2016 operating results and 2017 outlook in 2016 arconic’s revenues were stable compared to 2015 as volume growth in aerospace due to the rti acquisition see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations below and volume growth in automotive markets were offset by lower demand in commercial transportation and packaging markets in addition to lower aluminum prices impacting global rolled products despite stable revenues aftertax operating income “atoi” was higher in each segment in 2016 versus 2015 net productivity improvements across all operations exceeded cost headwinds and an unfavorable product mix as well as pricing pressures with various aerospace customers and in the global can sheet market 

arconic’s 2016 results were negatively impacted by costs associated with the separation transaction as well as significant tax valuation allowance charges related to an assessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets including alcoa corporation’s net deferred tax assets and arconic’s foreign tax credits in the us additionally significant restructuring charges see restructuring and other charges under results of operations below caused unfavorable impacts in the 2016 results 

management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows as well as improving its operating performance through cost reductions margin enhancement and profitable revenue generation management has also intensified its focus on capital efficiency with an owner’s mindset this focus and the related results enabled arconic to end 2016 with a solid financial position 

the following financial information reflects certain key measures of arconic’s 2016 results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2017 management is projecting that sales will be stable to down 5 as the unfavorable impact from the north american packaging rampdown approximately 400 reduction in sales from 552 in 2016 to approximately 150 in 2017 will continue see restructuring and other charges under results of operations below each segment is anticipated to grow sales in 2017 excluding the impact of ramping down north american packaging in the global rolled products segment in aerospace it is anticipated that the favorable impact of share gains on new platforms and engines will be somewhat offset by airframe destocking supply chain risks and engine rampup challenges that are expected to continue throughout 2017 management also expects strong growth in automotive sheet as well as growth in the building and construction market finally it is anticipated that the decline of north american heavy duty truck build rates will continue although not quite at the same level as 2016 that the mining and oil and gas markets will not recover in 2017 and that pressures from market mix and competitive pricing will continue 

  

looking ahead over the next year management will continue to focus on improving operating performance through cost reductions margin enhancement and profitable revenue generation each of the segments are projected to achieve stable to improved operating margins through net productivity savings in 2017 including from procurement and overhead programs 

on a companywide basis management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2017 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  results of operations 

earnings summary 

loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 1062 for 2016 or 258 per diluted share compared with a loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests of 157 for 2015 or 054 per share the decrease in results of 905 was primarily due to charges for tax valuation allowances and costs related to the separation transaction primarily offset by a fullyear effect of 2015 acquisitions see engineered products and solutions in segment information below and productivity improvements across all segments 

loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests was 157 for 2015 or 054 per diluted share compared with a loss from continuing operations after income taxes and noncontrolling interests of 61 for 2014 or 021 per share the decrease in results of 96 was mostly due to unfavorable price and product mix across all segments net unfavorable foreign currency movements and higher costs these negative impacts were partially offset by net productivity improvements higher volume across all segments and lower charges and expenses related to a number of portfolio actions eg divestitures and acquisitions 

sales— sales for 2016 were 12394 compared with sales of 12413 in 2015 a decline of 19 or less than 1 the relatively flat performance was the result of a fullyear effect of two 2015 acquisitions in the engineered products and solutions segment and automotive volume increases in the global rolled products segment offset by the rampdown of the tennessee packaging business and the impact of metal prices in the global rolled products segment and unfavorable price and product mix across all segments 

sales for 2015 were 12413 compared with sales of 12542 in 2014 a decline of 129 or 1 the decrease was primarily due to the absence of sales related to capacity that was closed or sold in the global rolled products segment see global rolled products in segment information below a lower average realized price for aluminum in the global rolled products segment and unfavorable foreign currency movements across all segments these negative impacts were partially offset by the addition of sales from three acquired businesses see engineered products and solutions in segment information below higher volume across all segments and favorable product mix in the global rolled products segment 

  

cost of goods sold cogs— cogs as a percentage of sales was 792 in 2016 compared with 814 in 2015 the primary drivers in the improvement in cogs as a percentage of sales were productivity gains across all segments and higher volume in the engineered products and solutions segment due to the benefit of a fullyear effect of two 2015 acquisitions this benefit was somewhat offset by overall cost increases across all segments and unfavorable pricing and product mix impacts primarily in the engineered products and solutions and global rolled products segments 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 814 in 2015 compared with 825 in 2014 the percentage was favorably impacted by net productivity improvements and higher volume across all segments and a favorable lifo last in first out adjustment due to lower prices for aluminum in the global rolled products segment these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable price and product mix across all segments and higher costs 

selling general administrative and other expenses sga — sga expenses were 942 or 76 of sales in 2016 compared with 765 or 62 of sales in 2015 the increase in sga was primarily due to costs related to the separation transaction of 193 in 2016 an increase of 169 from 2015 separation costs 

sga expenses were 765 or 62 of sales in 2015 compared with 770 or 61 of sales in 2014 the relatively flat expense was principally the result of favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar the absence of sga related to closed and sold locations and lower acquisition costs 15 primarily offset by expenses for professional and consulting services related to the separation transaction 24 and sga related to inorganic growth in the engineered products and solutions segment 

research and development expenses rd— rd expenses were 132 in 2016 compared with 169 in 2015 and 123 in 2014 the decrease in 2016 as compared to 2015 was driven by the decrease in spending for the micromill™ in san antonio tx which was completed in 2015 and began production of automotive sheet on a limited basis for the global rolled products segment the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was mainly driven by additional spending related to the upgrade of the micromill™ 

provision for depreciation and amortization da— the provision for da was 535 in 2016 compared with 508 in 2015 the increase of 27 or 53 related to a full year of da related to two acquisitions which occurred during 2015 see engineered products and solutions in segment information below 

the provision for da was 508 in 2015 compared with 436 in 2014 the increase of 72 or 165 related primarily to new da 93 associated with three acquisitions that occurred from november 2014 through july 2015 see engineered products and solutions in segment information below this increase was partially offset by the absence of da related to the divestiture andor permanent closure of six rolling mills see global rolled products in segment information below 

impairment of goodwill— in 2015 arconic recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of 25 related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil see goodwill in critical accounting policies and estimates below

solutions segment 45 in the global rolled products segment and 110 in corporate a net charge of 10 7 aftertax for other miscellaneous items and 10 5 aftertax for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods 

in early 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown of arconic’s two rolling mills in australia point henry and yennora this decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both australia and asia the two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200000 metrictonsperyear and were closed by the end of 2014 costs related to the shutdown of the two rolling mills included 56 for the separation of approximately 470 employees accelerated depreciation of 58 as the rolling mills continued to operate during 2014 asset impairments of 7 representing the writeoff of the remaining book value of all related properties plants and equipment and 33 in other exit costs additionally in 2014 remaining inventories mostly operating supplies and raw materials were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 13 9 aftertax which was recorded in cost of goods sold on the accompanying statement of consolidated operations the other exit costs of 33 represent 18 in environmental remediation and 8 in asset retirement obligations both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in australia and 7 in other related costs including supplier and customer contractrelated costs demolition and remediation activities related to the two rolling mills began in mid2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018 

as of december 31 2016 the separations associated with 2014 restructuring programs were essentially complete in 2016 2015 and 2014 cash payments of 3 27 and 54 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to 2014 restructuring programs 

arconic does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense— interest expense was 499 in 2016 compared with 473 in 2015 the increase of 26 or 5 was primarily due to debt issuance costs of 9 that were expensed in connection with the separation transaction and costs associated with the early redemption of 750 of 555 notes due february 2017 completed on december 30 2016 which included a 3 purchase premium and a fullyear of interest related to rti international metals inc rti debt of 6 

interest expense was 473 in 2015 compared with 442 in 2014 the increase of 31 or 7 was primarily due to an 8 higher average debt level somewhat offset by the absence of fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the thenplanned acquisition of firth rixson 13—see engineered products and solutions in segment information below the higher average debt level was mostly attributable to higher outstanding longterm debt due to the september 2014 issuance of 1250 in 5125 notes the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the firth rixson acquisition 

other income net— other income net was 94 in 2016 compared with 28 in 2015 the increase of 66 was mainly the result of a favorable adjustment to the contingent earnout liability and a postclosing adjustment both of which related to the november 2014 acquisition of firth rixson 76 and favorable foreign currency movements 55 these items were partially offset by the absence of gains on the sales of land in the united states and equity investment in a china rolling mill 38 in 2015 

other income net was 28 in 2015 compared with 5 in 2014 the increase of 23 was mainly the result of a gain on the sale of land around arconic’s former sherwin tx refinery site 19 and the remaining equity investment in a 

  

china rolling mill 19 and a favorable change in deferred compensation these items were somewhat offset by the absence of a gain on a portion of an equity investment in a china rolling mill 14 and an unfavorable change in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance 

income taxes— arconic’s effective tax rate was 3565 provision on income in 2016 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a 1267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the separation transaction see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below a 95 tax charge associated with the redemption of companyowned life insurance policies whose tax basis was less than the redemption amount resulting in a taxable gain a 51 net charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities due to tax rate and tax law changes a 34 unfavorable tax impact related to certain separation costs which are nondeductible for income tax purposes somewhat offset by a 39 discrete income tax benefit for the release of valuation allowances in canada and russia a 38 tax benefit related to currency impacts of a distribution of previously taxed income and a 26 favorable tax impact associated with nontaxable settlement proceeds and earnout liability adjustments in connection with the firth rixson acquisition 

arconic’s effective tax rate was 1852 provision on income in 2015 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to a 190 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the us and iceland see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below a 25 impairment of goodwill see impairment of goodwill above that is nondeductible for income tax purposes a loss on the sale of a rolling mill in russia see global rolled products in segment information below for which no tax benefit was recognized and a 34 net discrete income tax charge as described below 

in 2015 alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac the former joint venture owned 60 by arconic and 40 by alumina limited recognized an 85 discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in suriname see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards arconic also had a 51 deferred tax liability related to its 60share of these deferred tax assets that was written off as a result of the valuation allowance recognized by awac 

arconic’s effective tax rate was 1540 provision on income in 2014 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate mainly due to restructuring charges related to operations in australia benefit at a lower tax rate see restructuring and other charges above a 52 31 after noncontrolling interests discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in brazil see below a loss on the sale of three rolling mills in europe no tax benefit see global rolled products in segment information below and a 27 16 after noncontrolling interests discrete income tax charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in spain due to a november 2014 enacted tax rate change from 30 in 2014 to 28 in 2015 to 25 in 2016 these items were somewhat offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a 9 discrete income tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance related to operations in germany due to the initiation of a tax planning strategy 

in december 2011 one of arconic’s former subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations during 2013 the application was amended and refiled and separately a similar application was filed for another one of arconic’s former subsidiaries in brazil the deadline for the brazilian government to deny the application was july 11 2014 since arconic did not receive notice that its applications were denied the tax holiday took effect automatically on july 12 2014 as a result the tax rate applicable to qualified holiday income for these subsidiaries decreased significantly from 34 to 1525 resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10year holiday period retroactively effective as of january 1 2013 additionally a portion of one of the subsidiaries net deferred tax asset that reverses within the holiday period was remeasured at the new tax rate the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary was not remeasured since it could still be utilized against the subsidiary’s future earnings not subject to the tax holiday this remeasurement resulted in a decrease to that subsidiary’s net deferred tax assets and a noncash charge to earnings of 52 31 after noncontrolling interests 

  

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2017 will be between 32 and 35 however business portfolio actions changes in the current economic environment tax legislation or rate changes currency fluctuations ability to realize deferred tax assets movements in stock price impacting tax benefits or deficiencies on stockbased payment awards and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 

segment information 

arconic’s operations consist of three worldwide reportable segments global rolled products engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutions see below segment performance under arconic’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting metal price lag the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment—generally when the price of metal increases metal lag is favorable and when the price of metal decreases metal lag is unfavorable interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges and other items including intersegment profit eliminations differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 1087 in 2016 986 in 2015 and 983 in 2014 the following information provides shipment sales and atoi data for each reportable segment as well as certain realized price data for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2016 see note o to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

beginning in the first quarter of 2017 arconic’s segment reporting metric will change from atoi to adjusted ebitda 

global rolled products 1 

 

   

 the global rolled products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets sheet and plate is sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace automotive commercial transportation packaging building and construction and industrial products mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables end markets a small portion of this segment also produces aseptic foil for the packaging end market while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of sheet 

  

and plate is to a relatively small number of customers generally the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are mostly the us dollar chinese yuan the euro the russian ruble the brazilian real and the british pound 

in march 2015 arconic completed the sale of a rolling mill located in belaya kalitva russia to a whollyowned subsidiary of stupino titanium company while owned by arconic the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mill were included in the global rolled products segment the rolling mill generated sales of approximately 130 in 2014 and at the time of divestiture had approximately 1870 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

in december 2014 arconic completed the sale of three rolling mills located in spain alicante and amorebieta and france castelsarrasin to a subsidiary of atlas holdings llc while owned by arconic the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mills were included in the global rolled products segment the rolling mills combined generated sales of approximately 500 in 2013 and at the time of divestiture had approximately 750 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

in february 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown of arconic’s two rolling mills in australia point henry and yennora this decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both australia and asia the two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmtperyear and were closed by the end of 2014 see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

thirdparty sales for the global rolled products segment declined 7 in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to the rampdown of tennessee packaging 251 lower aluminum prices and lower demand in the industrial products packaging commercial aerospace commercial transportation and north american heavy duty truck markets these decreases were partially offset by higher volume in the automotive market 

thirdparty sales for this segment declined 17 in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by the absence of sales 1052 from six rolling mills in australia spain russia and france see above unfavorable pricing mostly due to a decrease in metal prices both lme and regional premium components and unfavorable foreign currency movements mainly the result of a weaker euro russian ruble and brazilian real these negative impacts were somewhat offset by increased demand of the remaining rolling portfolio and favorable product mix automotive and aerospace versus industrial products the volume improvement of the remaining portfolio was largely attributable to the automotive north america and can sheet packaging china end markets slightly offset by lower demand in the industrial products end market 

atoi for the global rolled products segment increased 44 or 20 in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by strong productivity improvements which significantly exceeded cost increases partially offset by lower pricing primarily due to overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet market unfavorable product mix and lower volumes as detailed above 

atoi for this segment increased 1 in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily attributable to net productivity improvements across most businesses and higher volumes principally driven by higher demand in the automotive end market offset by unfavorable price and product mix largely the result of overall pricing pressure in the global can sheet packaging end market and higher costs related to growth projects including research and development as arconic develops and qualifies products from a new micromill™ production process and the rampup of the tennessee automotive expansion 

on november 1 2016 arconic entered into a toll processing and services agreement with alcoa corporation for the tolling of metal for the warrick in rolling mill which became a part of alcoa corporation upon the completion of the separation transaction as part of this arrangement arconic will provide a toll processing service to alcoa corporation to produce can sheet products at its facility in tennessee through the expected end date of the contract 

  

december 31 2018 alcoa corporation will supply all required raw materials to arconic and arconic will process the raw materials into finished can sheet coils ready for shipment to the end customer tolling revenue for the two months ended december 31 2016 was approximately 37 million 

in 2017 demand in the automotive end market is expected to continue to grow due to the growing demand for innovative products and aluminumintensive vehicles demand from the commercial airframe end market is expected to be flat in 2017 as the ramp up of new programs is offset by customer destocking and lower build rates for aluminum intensive widebody programs sales to the packaging market are expected to decline due to continuing pricing pressure within this market and the rampdown of the north american packaging operations net productivity improvements are anticipated to continue 

engineered products and solutions 

 

 the engineered products and solutions segment produces products that are used primarily in the aerospace commercial and defense commercial transportation and power generation end markets such products include fastening systems titanium steel and nickel superalloys and seamless rolled rings mostly nickel superalloys investment castings nickel superalloys titanium and aluminum including airfoils and forged jet engine components eg jet engine disks and extruded machined and formed aircraft parts titanium and aluminum all of which are sold directly to customers and through distributors more than 75 of the thirdparty sales in this segment are from the aerospace end market a small part of this segment also produces various forged extruded and machined metal products titanium aluminum and steel for the oil and gas industrial products automotive and land and sea defense end markets seasonal decreases in sales are generally experienced in the third quarter of the year due to the european summer slowdown across all end markets generally the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are mostly the us dollar british pound and the euro 

in july 2015 arconic completed the acquisition of rti a global supplier of titanium and specialty metal products and services for the commercial aerospace defense energy and medical device end markets the purpose of the acquisition was to expand arconic’s range of titanium offerings and add advanced technologies and materials primarily related to the aerospace end market in 2014 rti generated net sales of 794 and had approximately 2600 employees the operating results and assets and liabilities of rti have been included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition 

in march 2015 arconic completed the acquisition of tital a privately held aerospace castings company with approximately 650 employees based in germany tital produces aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets in 2014 tital generated sales of approximately 100 the purpose of the acquisition was to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium establish titaniumcasting capabilities in europe and expand existing aluminum casting capacity the operating results and assets and liabilities of tital have been included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition 

in november 2014 arconic completed the acquisition of firth rixson a global leader in aerospace jet engine components firth rixson manufactures rings forgings and metal products for the aerospace end market as well as other markets requiring highlyengineered material applications the purpose of the acquisition was to strengthen arconic’s aerospace business and position the company to capture additional aerospace growth with a broader range of highgrowth valueadd jet engine components firth rixson generated sales of approximately 970 in 2014 and had 13 operating facilities in the united states united kingdom europe and asia employing approximately 2400 people combined the operating results and assets and liabilities of firth rixson have been included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition 

  

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment improved 7 in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily attributable to higher thirdparty sales of the two acquired businesses 457 primarily related to the aerospace end market and increased demand from the industrial gas turbine end market partially offset by lower volumes in the oil and gas end market and commercial transportation end market as well as pricing pressures in aerospace 

thirdparty sales for this segment improved 27 in 2015 compared with 2014 largely attributable to the thirdparty sales 1310 of the three acquired businesses see above and higher volumes in this segment’s legacy businesses both of which were primarily related to the aerospace end market these positive impacts were slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements principally driven by a weaker euro 

atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment increased 47 or 8 in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily related to net productivity improvements across all businesses as well as the volume increase from both the rti acquisition and organic revenue growth partially offset by a lower margin product mix and pricing pressures in the aerospace end market 

atoi for this segment increased 16 or 3 in 2015 compared with 2014 principally the result of net productivity improvements across most businesses a positive contribution from acquisitions and overall higher volumes in this segment’s legacy businesses these positive impacts were partially offset by unfavorable price and product mix higher costs related to growth projects and net unfavorable foreign currency movements primarily related to a weaker euro 

in 2017 demand in the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong driven by the ramp up of new aerospace engine platforms somewhat offset by continued customer destocking and engine rampup challenges demand in the defense end market is expected to grow due to the continuing rampup of certain aerospace programs additionally net productivity improvements are anticipated while pricing pressure across all markets is likely to continue 

transportation and construction solutions 

 

 the transportation and construction solutions segment produces products that are used mostly in the nonresidential building and construction and commercial transportation end markets such products include integrated aluminum structural systems architectural extrusions and forged aluminum commercial vehicle wheels which are sold both directly to customers and through distributors a small part of this segment also produces aluminum products for the industrial products end market generally the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are primarily the us dollar the euro and the brazilian real 

thirdparty sales for the transportation and construction solutions segment decreased 4 in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by lower demand from the north american commercial transportation end market which was partially offset by rising demand from the building and construction end market 

thirdparty sales for this segment decreased 7 in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency movements principally caused by a weaker euro and brazilian real and lower volume related to the building and construction end market somewhat offset by higher volume related to the commercial transportation end market 

atoi for the transportation and construction solutions segment increased 10 or 6 in 2016 compared with 2015 principally driven by net productivity improvements across all businesses and growth in the building and construction segment partially offset by lower demand in the north american heavy duty truck and brazilian markets 

  

atoi for this segment declined 14 or 8 in 2015 compared with 2014 mainly due to higher costs net unfavorable foreign currency movements primarily related to a weaker euro and brazilian real and unfavorable price and product mix these negative impacts were mostly offset by net productivity improvements across all businesses 

in 2017 we expect continued growth in the north american and european nonresidential building and construction end markets and continued demand for innovative products it will be partially offset by the expected yearoveryear decline in the north american build rates in the commercial transportation end market additionally net productivity improvements are anticipated 

reconciliation of atoi to consolidated net loss income attributable to arconic 

items required to reconcile total segment atoi to consolidated net loss income attributable to arconic include the impact of lifo inventory accounting metal price lag the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment – generally when the price of metal increases metal lag is favorable and when the price of metal decreases metal lag is unfavorable interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities corporate research and development expenses along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges and other items including intersegment profit eliminations differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income

liquidity and capital resources 

arconic maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet in 2016 as has been the focus since 2008 management initiated actions to significantly improve arconic’s cost structure and liquidity providing the company with the ability to operate effectively such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures in 2017 this approach is expected to continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures by more than 350 and debt pay down of approximately 1 billion 

along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover arconic’s operational and business needs over the next 12 months for an analysis of longterm liquidity see contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements below 

at december 31 2016 cash and cash equivalents of arconic were 1863 of which 640 was held outside the united states arconic has a number of commitments and obligations related to the company’s growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions resulting in the need for cash outside the united states as such management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions 

  

the statement of consolidated cash flows has not been restated for discontinued operations therefore the discussion below concerning cash from operations financing activities and investing activities includes the results of both arconic and alcoa corporation up through the completion of the separation transaction on november 1 2016 

cash from operations 

cash provided from operations in 2016 was 870 compared with 1582 in 2015 the decrease of 712 or 45 was primarily due to lower operating results net loss plus net addback for noncash transactions in earnings of 985 and a negative change in working capital of 104 and noncurrent liabilities of 21 partially offset by a positive change associated with noncurrent assets of 218 and a decrease in pension contributions of 180 

the components of the negative change in working capital were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 cash provided from operations in 2015 was 1582 compared with 1674 in 2014 the decrease of 92 or 5 was due to a negative change in noncurrent assets of 328 lower operating results net loss income plus net addback for noncash transactions in earnings and a negative change in noncurrent liabilities of 18 mostly offset by a positive change associated with working capital of 572 and lower pension contributions of 31 

the components of the positive change in working capital were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the unfavorable change in noncurrent assets was mostly related to a 300 prepayment made under a natural gas supply agreement in australia alcoa corporation 

financing activities 

cash used for financing activities was 754 in 2016 compared with cash used from financing of 441 in 2015 and cash provided from financing activities of 2250 in 2014 

  

the use of cash of 754 in 2016 was principally the result of 2734 in payments on debt mostly related to the repayment of borrowings under certain revolving credit facilitates see below and the repayment in december 2016 of 750 of outstanding principal of 555 notes due february 2017 228 in dividends to shareholders and 175 in net cash paid to noncontrolling interests these items were mostly offset by 1962 in additions to debt virtually all of which was the result of borrowing under certain revolving credit facilities and 421 in net cash transferred from alcoa corporation at the completion of the separation transaction

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for environmental and litigation matters the testing of goodwill other intangible assets and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses acquired or divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed 

  

probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment arconic has eight reporting units of which four are included in the engineered products and solutions segment three are included in the transportation and construction solutions segment and the remaining reporting unit is the global rolled products segment more than 70 of arconic’s total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows arconic fastening systems and rings afsr 2200 and arconic power and propulsion app 1647 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment these amounts include an allocation of corporate’s goodwill 

in november 2014 arconic acquired firth rixson see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations above and as a result recognized 1801 in goodwill this amount was allocated between the afsr and arconic forgings and extrusions afe reporting units both of which are part of the engineered products and solutions segment in march and july 2015 arconic acquired tital and rti respectively see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations above and recognized 117 and 298 respectively in goodwill the goodwill amount related to tital was allocated to the app reporting unit and the amount related to rti was allocated to arconic titanium and engineered products atep a new arconic reporting unit that consists solely of the acquired rti business and is part of the engineered products and solutions segment 

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the existing twostep quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test 

arconic’s policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test generally management will proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for up to four reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill this policy will result in each of the seven reporting units with goodwill being subjected to the twostep quantitative impairment test at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on 

  

current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2016 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for three reporting units the global rolled products segment atep and building and construction systems within the transportation and construction solutions segment management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the three reporting units were less than their carrying values as such no further analysis was required 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill arconic uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices production costs tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

during the 2016 annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for four reporting units as follows afsr app and afe which are all included in the eps segment and arconic wheel and transportation products which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value resulting in no impairment 

goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units except for the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil sae which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test 

in 2015 for sae the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value of the sae reporting unit’s goodwill as a result management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of the sae reporting unit’s goodwill the results of the secondstep analysis showed that the implied fair value of the goodwill was zero therefore in the fourth quarter of 2015 arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of 25 the impairment of the sae goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn in the brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies as a result of the goodwill impairment there is no goodwill remaining for the sae reporting unit 

properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets properties plants and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the 

  

estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking consumer products transportation insurance and pharmaceutical among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 11 years and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2016 2015 and 2014 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 420 429 and 400 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 210 and either a charge or credit of approximately 6 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

in conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2015 management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond previously the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations under the new methodology the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate referred to as the “spot rate” approach this change resulted in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology of 98 64 aftertax in 2016 management believes this new methodology which represents a change in an accounting estimate is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fouryear average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on various historical moving averages when developing this assumption while consideration is given to recent performance and historical returns the assumption represents a longterm prospective return management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

  

for 2016 2015 and 2014 management used 775 775 and 800 as its expected longterm rate of return which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class these rates fell within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class in 2015 the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20year moving average of actual performance for 2017 management anticipates that 775 will be the expected longterm rate of return 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 8 for 2017 

during 2014 an independent us organization that publishes standard mortality rates based on statistical analysis and studies issued updated mortality tables the rates within these standard tables are used by actuaries as one of the many assumptions when measuring a company’s projected benefit obligation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans the funded status of all of arconic’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of december 31 each calendar year during the measurement process at the end of 2014 arconic with the assistance of an external actuary considered the rates in the new mortality tables along with specific data related to arconic’s retiree population to develop the mortalityrelated assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation of various us benefit plans as a result arconic recognized a charge of approximately 100 65 aftertax in other comprehensive loss related to the updated mortality assumptions 

in 2016 a net benefit of 1601 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the transfer of 2080 to alcoa corporation which was partially offset by a net charge of 479 the charge was due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets and a 9 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was partially offset by the amortization of actuarial losses in 2015 a net charge of 10 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets which was mostly offset by the amortization of actuarial losses and a 29 basis point increase in the discount rate in 2014 a net charge of 69 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to an 80 basis point increase in the discount rate and a change in the mortality assumption see above which was mostly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation arconic recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

as part of arconic’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2016 2015 and 2014 was 76 51 aftertax 77 51 aftertax and 70 47 aftertax respectively of these amounts 19 15 and 11 in 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of arconic’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

  

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and arconic’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

in 2016 arconic recognized a 1267 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances related to the separation transaction including 925 with respect to alcoa corporation’s net deferred tax assets in the united states 302 with respect to arconic’s foreign tax credits in the united states 42 with respect to certain deferred tax assets in luxembourg and 2 related to the net impact of other smaller items after weighing all positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that the net deferred tax assets of alcoa corporation were not more likely than not to be realized due to lack of historical and projected domestic source taxable income as such a valuation allowance was recorded immediately prior to separation 

upon separation arconic retained foreign tax credits in the united states which have a 10year carryforward period with expirations ranging from 2017 to 2026 as of december 31 2016 arconic also retained suspended foreign tax credit carryforwards whose expiration period begins when the credits become unsuspended a valuation allowance of 135 was initially established in 2013 on a portion of the foreign tax credit carryforwards primarily due to insufficient foreign source income to allow for full utilization of the credits within the expiration period an incremental valuation allowance of 134 was recognized in 2015 at the end of 2015 and 2016 15 and 128 of foreign tax credits respectively expired resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance as a result of the separation transaction management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that arconic would realize the full tax benefit of its foreign tax credit carryforwards based on changes in the availability of foreign sourced taxable income after consideration of all available evidence including potential tax planning strategies and earnings of foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends an incremental valuation allowance of 302 was recognized in 2016 at december 31 2016 the cumulative amount of the valuation allowance was 427 the need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances 

in addition arconic recognized a 42 discrete income tax charge in 2016 for a valuation allowance on the full value of certain net deferred tax assets in luxembourg sources of taxable income which previously supported the net deferred tax asset are no longer available as a result of the separation transaction the need for this valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result the allowance may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances 

in 2016 arconic also recognized discrete income tax benefits related to the release of valuation allowances on certain net deferred tax assets in russia and canada of 19 and 20 respectively after weighing all available evidence management determined that it was more likely than not that the net income tax benefits associated with the underlying deferred tax assets would be realizable based on historical cumulative income and projected taxable income 

arconic also recorded additional valuation allowances in australia of 93 related to the separation transaction in spain of 163 related to a tax law change and in luxembourg of 280 related to the separation transaction as well as a 

  

tax law change these valuation allowances fully offset current year changes in deferred tax asset balances of each respective jurisdiction resulting in no net impact to tax expense the need for a valuation allowance will be reassessed on a continuous basis in future periods by each jurisdiction and as a result the allowances may increase or decrease based on changes in facts and circumstances 

in 2015 arconic recognized an additional 141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in iceland and suriname of this amount an 85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in suriname which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022 as of december 31 2015 the remaining 56 charge relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in iceland these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023 after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that arconic will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

 item 9b other information 

in connection with the separation arconic’s board of directors conducted a special review of the company’s compensation arrangements and on january 13 2017 it approved amendments to the company’s change in control severance plan the “cic plan” which took effect on february 27 2017 certain senior executives of the company including klaus kleinfeld the chief executive officer and ken giacobbe the chief financial officer participate in the cic plan prior to the amendments mr kleinfeld was the sole participant in the cic plan who retained two grandfathered benefits under the plan – eligibility for a golden parachute excise tax reimbursement and the right to resign for any reason during a window of thirty days beginning six months following a change in control and receive severance benefits – which were previously eliminated from the cic plan for new participants who became eligible on or after january 1 2010 the amendments to the cic plan eliminated both of these grandfathered benefits for mr kleinfeld in addition the amendments reduced the level of severance benefits for participants in the cic plan below the level of chief executive officer consequently the severance benefits for which mr giacobbe is potentially eligible under the amended cic plan are i a cash payment equal to two times annual salary plus target annual cash incentive compensation reduced from three times ii continuation of health care benefits for two years reduced from three years iii two additional years of pension credit calculated as described in the cic plan reduced from three years and iv six months of outplacement benefits there was no change to this benefit 

arconic’s board of directors also approved on january 13 2017 the arconic inc executive severance plan the “severance plan” which took effect on february 27 2017 the severance plan covers the same executives who are eligible to participate in the cic plan other than any such executive who is party to an individual agreement providing for severance benefits mr kleinfeld is party to an individual agreement dated december 8 2008 with the company providing for severance benefits on an involuntary termination of employment that are substantially similar to those 

  

provided under the severance plan which are described below mr kleinfeld has waived the severance benefits under such individual agreement pursuant to a letter agreement dated february 27 2017 the “letter agreement” and is therefore eligible to participate in the severance plan the severance plan provides for severance benefits upon a termination of a participant’s employment without cause or resignation by a participant for good reason unless the participant receives severance benefits under the cic plan subject to execution and nonrevocation of a general release of legal claims against the company the severance benefits under the severance plan for messrs kleinfeld and giacobbe are i a cash severance payment equal to two times for mr kleinfeld and one times for mr giacobbe the sum of base salary and target annual cash incentive ii continued health care benefits for a twoyear period and iii two additional years of pension accrual calculated as described in the severance plan

information describing alcoa’s businesses can be found on the indicated pages of this report 

 

 the following tables and related discussion of the company’s bauxite interests alumina refining and primary aluminum facilities and capacities global rolled products engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutions provide additional description of alcoa’s businesses the alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac alcoa owns 60 and alumina limited owns 40 of these individual entities for more information on awac see exhibit nos 10a through 10f1 to this report 

proposed separation transaction 

on september 28 2015 alcoa announced that its board of directors approved a plan to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies one company will comprise the alumina and primary metals segments and the other company will comprise the global rolled products engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutions segments alcoa is targeting to complete the separation in the second half of 2016 the 

  

transaction is subject to a number of conditions including but not limited to final approval by alcoa’s board of directors receipt of a favorable opinion of legal counsel with respect to the taxfree nature of the transaction for us federal income tax purposes completed financing and the effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement to be filed with the us securities and exchange commission upon completion of the separation alcoa shareholders will own all of the outstanding shares of both companies alcoa may at any time and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete abandon the separation plan or modify or change its terms 

bauxite interests 

this bauxite interests section explains the company’s interests in various bauxite mines throughout the world bauxite is one of the company’s basic raw materials and is also a product sold into the thirdparty marketplace this section provides mine description and reserve and annual production figures in respect of the company’s interests 

aluminum is one of the most abundant elements in the earth’s crust aluminum metal is produced by smelting alumina alumina is produced primarily from refining bauxite bauxite contains various aluminum hydroxide minerals the most important of which are gibbsite and boehmite alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina the company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the awac enterprise located in the countries listed in the table below as well as pursuant to both longterm and shortterm contracts and mining leases tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons bdmt unless otherwise stated see the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this section 

during 2015 mines operated by alcoa owned by alcoa and awac produced 383 million bdmt and separately mines operated by third parties with alcoa and awac equity interests produced 70 million bdmt on a proportional equity basis for a total bauxite production of 453 million bdmt 

based on the terms of its bauxite supply contracts awac bauxite purchases from mineração rio do norte sa mrn and compagnie des bauxites de guinée cbg differ from its proportional equity in those mines therefore during 2015 awac had access to 478 million bdmt of production from its portfolio of mines 

during 2015 awac sold 20 million bdmt of bauxite to third parties and purchased 11 million bdmt from third parties the bauxite delivered to alcoa and awac refineries amounted to 468 million bdmt during 2015 

the company is growing its thirdparty bauxite sales business during the third quarter of 2015 alcoa received permission from the government of western australia to export trial shipments from its western australia mines 

the company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date of this report for purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as feedstock to its refineries the company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves bauxite resources represent deposits for which tonnage densities shape physical characteristics grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits and include diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining metallurgical economic marketing legal environmental social and governmental factors alcoa employs a conventional approach including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing alcoa to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves 

the table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the company while the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for the company’s mining locations given the company’s extensive bauxite resources the abundant supply of bauxite 

  

globally and the length of the company’s rights to bauxite it is not costeffective to invest the significant funds and efforts necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the company rather bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future 

bauxite resource development guidelines 

alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with alcoa’s internal guidelines as administered by the alcoa ore reserves committee aorc the reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions alcoa does not use a price for bauxite alumina or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves the primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery in addition to these specifications a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material alcoa mining locations have annual infill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and resource classification of their bauxite

the major raw materials purchased in 2015 for each of the company’s reportable segments are listed below 

 

 generally other materials are purchased from thirdparty suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements the company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available 

for each metric ton of alumina produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

   

for each metric ton of aluminum produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

 explanatory note certain aluminum produced by alcoa also includes alloying materials because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce alcoa’s various alloys providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful with the exception of a very small number of internally used products alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to an aluminum association standard the aluminum association of which alcoa is an active member uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types in general each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also have other constituents as well but of lesser amounts 

energy 

employing the bayer process alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power energy accounts for approximately 19 of the company’s total alumina refining production costs electric power accounts for approximately 23 of the company’s primary aluminum production costs alcoa generates approximately 14 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and natural gas for alcoa’s smelters and refineries

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business financial condition or results of operations including causing alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to alcoa or that alcoa currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods 

  

the aluminum industry and aluminum enduse markets are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical and alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and aluminum enduse markets alcoa sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the commercial construction and transportation automotive and aerospace industries and the demand for its products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in the general us or worldwide economy currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond its control 

the demand for aluminum is highly correlated to economic growth for example the european sovereign debt crisis that began in late 2009 had an adverse effect on european demand for aluminum and aluminum products the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for and supply of commodities including aluminum a sustained slowdown in china’s economic growth and aluminum demand or a significant slowdown in other markets that is not offset by decreases in supply or by increased aluminum demand in emerging economies such as india brazil and several south east asian countries could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices 

while alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum and aluminum products are positive the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength of the global economy and the effects of government intervention negative economic conditions such as a major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period a downturn in the commodity sector or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices including global regional and productspecific prices 

the overall price of primary aluminum consists of several components 1 the underlying base metal component which is typically based on quoted prices from the london metal exchange lme 2 the regional premium which comprises the incremental price over the base lme component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region eg the midwest premium for metal sold in the united states and 3 the product premium which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape eg coil billet slab rod etc or alloy each of the above three components has its own drivers of variability 

the lme price is typically driven by macroeconomic factors global supply and demand of aluminum including expectations for growth and contraction and the level of global inventories and financial investors an imbalance in global supply and demand of aluminum such as decreasing demand without corresponding supply declines could have a negative impact on aluminum pricing speculative trading in aluminum and the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets have also increased in recent years potentially contributing to higher levels of price volatility in 2015 the cash lme price of aluminum reached a high of 1919 per metric ton and a low of 1424 per metric ton high lme inventories or the release of substantial inventories into the market could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum declines in the lme price have had a negative impact on alcoa’s results of operations 

additionally alcoa’s results could be adversely affected by decreases in regional premiums that participants in the physical metal market pay for immediate delivery of aluminum regional premiums tend to vary based on the supply of and demand for metal in a particular region and associated transportation costs lme warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease and surpluses have caused regional premiums to decrease which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations 

product premiums generally are a function of supply and demand for a given primary aluminum shape and alloy combination in a particular region a sustained weak lme aluminum pricing environment deterioration in lme aluminum prices or a decrease in regional premiums or product premiums could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations or cash flow 

  

lme warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease 

since 2013 the lme has been engaged in a program aimed at reforming the rules under which registered warehouses in its global network operate the initial rule changes took effect on february 1 2015 and the lme has announced additional changes that will be implemented in 2016 these rule changes and any subsequent changes that the exchange chooses to make could impact the supplydemand balance in the primary aluminum physical market and may impact regional delivery premiums and lme aluminum prices decreases in regional delivery premiums andor decreases in lme aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations or cash flow 

alcoa may not be able to realize the expected benefits from its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its valueadd business and by creating a lower cost competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio 

alcoa is continuing to execute on its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its valueadd business to capture profitable growth as a lightweight metals innovation leader and by creating a lower cost competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio it is investing in its valueadd manufacturing and engineering businesses to capture growth opportunities in strong end markets like automotive and aerospace alcoa is building out its valueadd businesses including by introducing innovative new products and technology solutions and investing in expansions of valueadd capacity alcoa’s growth projects include the joint venture with ma’aden in saudi arabia the automotive expansions in davenport iowa and alcoa tennessee the aluminum lithium capacity expansion in lafayette indiana at the alcoa technical center in pennsylvania and at the kitts green plant in the united kingdom and the expansion in aerospace capabilities in la porte indiana hampton virginia and davenport iowa from time to time alcoa also pursues growth opportunities that are strategically aligned with its objectives such as the acquisition of the firth rixson business completed in november 2014 the acquisition of tital completed in march 2015 and the acquisition of rti international metals completed in july 2015 in addition alcoa is optimizing its rolling mill portfolio as part of its strategy for profitable growth in the midstream business at the same time the company is creating a competitive commodity business by taking decisive actions to lower the cost base of its upstream operations including closing selling or curtailing highcost global smelting capacity optimizing alumina refining capacity and pursuing the sale of its interest in certain other operations 

alcoa has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio although management believes that its strategic actions are beneficial to alcoa there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized adverse factors may prevent alcoa from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines acquisitions present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company unanticipated costs and liabilities and the ability to realize anticipated benefits such as growth in market share revenue or margins at the levels or in the timeframe expected the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully 

with respect to portfolio optimization actions such as divestitures curtailments and closures alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders in addition alcoa may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if a buyer fails to honor all commitments alcoa’s business operations are capital intensive and curtailment or closure of operations or facilities may include significant charges including employee separation costs asset impairment charges and other measures 

there can be no assurance that acquisitions growth investments divestitures or closures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to alcoa 

marketdriven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by nonmarket forces or other impediments to production closures 

in response to marketdriven factors relating to the global supply and demand of aluminum alcoa has curtailed or closed portions of its aluminum production certain other aluminum producers have independently undertaken to make cuts in production as well however the existence of nonmarket forces on global aluminum industry capacity such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry selfsufficiency may 

  

prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers’ smelters irrespective of their position on the industry cost curve other production cuts may be impeded by longterm contracts to buy power or raw materials if industry overcapacity persists due to the disruption by such nonmarket forces on the marketdriven balancing of the global supply and demand of aluminum the resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect the operating results of aluminum producers including alcoa 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts certain conditions could negatively affect alcoa’s results of operations including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if events such as those listed above were to occur the resulting high energy costs or the disruption of an energy source or the requirement to repay all or a portion of the benefit alcoa received under a power supply interruptibility regime could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business and results of operations 

alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects of decreases in commodity or lmelinked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations alcoa may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results are affected by significant lag effects of declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in the lmelinked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period increases in the cost of raw materials or decreases in input costs that are disproportionate to concurrent sharper decreases in the price of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s operating results 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar 

  

euro and norwegian kroner may affect alcoa’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies while the company’s upstream products are generally sold in us dollars in addition although a strong us dollar generally has a positive impact on alcoa’s nearterm profitability over a longer term a strong us dollar may have an unfavorable impact to alcoa’s position on the global aluminum cost curve due to alcoa’s us smelting portfolio as the us dollar strengthens the cost curve shifts down for smelters outside the us but costs for alcoa’s us smelting portfolio may not decline 

alcoa may not be able to successfully realize future targets or goals established for its business segments at the levels or by the dates targeted 

from time to time alcoa may announce future targets or goals for its business which are based on the company’s then current expectations estimates forecasts and projections about the operating environment economies and markets in which alcoa operates future targets and goals reflect the company’s beliefs and assumptions and its perception of historical trends then current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors management believes are appropriate in the circumstances as such targets and goals are inherently subject to significant business economic competitive and other uncertainties and contingencies regarding future events including the risks discussed in this report the actual outcome may be materially different there can be no assurance that any targets or goals established by the company will be accomplished at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all failure to achieve the targets or goals by the company may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations or the market price of its securities 

alcoa faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1 business—competitive conditions of this report the markets for alcoa’s aluminum and nonaluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets including some that are subsidized alcoa’s metals including aluminum titanium and nickel compete with other materials such as steel plastics composites ceramics and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets new product offerings or new technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace alcoa products the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its businesses and key end markets and in the case of its upstream businesses having access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings could limit alcoa’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs increase the pricing of its credit facilities adversely affect the market price of its securities trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

standard and poor’s ratings services currently rates alcoa’s longterm debt bbb the lowest level of investment grade rating with a stable ratings outlook ratings and outlook were affirmed on march 9 2015 on september 28 2015 sp issued a statement that these ratings and outlook for alcoa were not affected by alcoa’s plan to separate into two publiclytraded companies on may 29 2013 moody’s investors service downgraded alcoa’s longterm debt rating from baa3 to ba1 which is below investment grade and changed the outlook from rating under review to stable on april 30 2015 moody’s changed the outlook from stable to positive on september 28 2015 moody’s affirmed these ratings and changed the current outlook from positive to developing based on alcoa’s plan to separate into two publiclytraded companies on january 21 2016 moody’s placed alcoa’s longterm debt rating under review and changed the current outlook from developing to rating under review while leaving alcoa’s shortterm debt rating unchanged on april 11 2014 fitch ratings downgraded alcoa’s rating from bbb to bb a below investment grade rating and changed the outlook from negative to stable on april 16 2015 fitch ratings affirmed alcoa’s rating of 

  

bb but revised alcoa’s outlook to positive on september 30 2015 fitch placed these ratings on “ratings watch positive” based on alcoa’s plan to separate into two publiclytraded companies 

there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take negative actions with respect to alcoa’s ratings increased debt levels adverse aluminum market or macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of alcoa’s securities adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by standard and poor’s or a further downgrade by moody’s would subject alcoa to higher costs under alcoa’s fiveyear revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from alcoa or otherwise impair alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations 

cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of alcoa’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 

alcoa faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on alcoa’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact alcoa’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and result in the diminution of the value of the company’s investment in research and development 

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future for example in december 2009 alcoa formed a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex including a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill in the kingdom of saudi arabia although the company has in connection with the saudi arabia joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

   

  

  

 there can be no assurance that alcoa’s joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

alcoa’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures 

alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities for 2016 generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital expenditures continues to be an alcoa target insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact alcoa’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and returnseeking capital projects over the long term alcoa’s ability to take advantage of improved aluminum or other market conditions or growth opportunities in its midstream and downstream businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions which could adversely affect the longterm value of its business and the company’s position in relation to its competitors 

alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates if alcoa’s interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions its growth could be constrained any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

alcoa’s global operations expose the company to risks that could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states including brazil china europe guinea russia and the kingdom of saudi arabia the company’s global operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 while the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events 

  

  

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

alcoa’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense alcoa records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how alcoa’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note w to the consolidated financial statements—pension and other postretirement benefits in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities alcoa would contribute to the pension plans 

potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act “map21” enacted in 2012 provided temporary relief for employers like alcoa who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations in 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law hatfa extended the relief provided by map21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map21 in 2015 the bipartisan budget act of 2015 bba 2015 was signed into law bba 2015 extends the relief period provided by hafta alcoa believes that the relief provided by bba 2015 will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years however higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the company’s cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans adversely affecting alcoa’s liquidity and results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect alcoa’s future profitability 

alcoa is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect the company’s tax expense and profitability alcoa’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions significant changes to the us corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact positive or negative on alcoa’s effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

  

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

a significant portion of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1 business of this report while alcoa was previously successful in renegotiating the master collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers the most recent renegotiation having taken place in june 2014 alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate that agreement or other collective bargaining agreements in the us and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments including additive manufacturing alloy development engineered finishes and product design high speed continuous casting and rolling technology and other advanced manufacturing technologies for more information on alcoa’s research and development programs see “research and development” in part i item 1 business of this report there can be no assurance that such developments or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

alcoa’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

alcoa’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company or the industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoa’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

alcoa may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies deployment of companywide business process models such as alcoa’s degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings and overhead cost reductions there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to 

  

alcoa the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws antibribery laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts 

while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which alcoa may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by the company sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future compliance with environmental health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than the company anticipates alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

climate change climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia québec’s transition to a “cap and trade” system with compliance required beginning 2013 the european union emissions trading scheme and the united states’ clean power plan which became effective on december 22 2015 alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations 

  

directly or indirectly through customers or alcoa’s supply chain inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly from changes in costs of goods sold 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

alcoa’s plan to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline or at all and will involve significant time and expense which could disrupt or adversely affect alcoa’s business 

on september 28 2015 alcoa announced plans to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies a valueadd company comprising the global rolled products engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutions segments and an upstream company comprising the alumina and primary metals segments the separation which is currently targeted to be completed in the second half of 2016 is subject to approval by alcoa’s board of directors of the final terms of the separation and market regulatory and certain other conditions unanticipated developments including among others failure of the separation to qualify for the expected tax treatment the possibility that any thirdparty consents required in connection with the separation will not be received material adverse changes in aluminum industry conditions and changes in global economic and financial market conditions generally could delay or prevent the completion of the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected 

alcoa expects that the process of completing the proposed separation will be timeconsuming and involve significant costs and expenses which may be significantly higher than what it currently anticipates and may not yield a benefit if the separation is not completed executing the proposed separation will require significant time and attention from alcoa’s senior management and employees which could disrupt the company’s ongoing business and adversely affect the financial results and results of operations alcoa may also experience increased difficulties in attracting retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion which could harm the company’s businesses 

the separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits 

alcoa may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic financial operational or other benefits from the separation as independent publiclytraded companies the valueadd and upstream companies will be smaller less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions such as changes in aluminum industry conditions which could result in increased volatility in their cash flows working capital and financing requirements and could materially and adversely affect the respective business financial condition and results of operations further there can be no assurance that the combined value of the common stock of the two publiclytraded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of alcoa’s common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred 

the proposed separation may result in disruptions to and negatively impact alcoa’s relationships with the company’s suppliers customers and other business partners 

uncertainty related to the proposed separation may lead suppliers customers and other parties with which alcoa currently does business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing 

  

business relationships or to consider entering into business relationships with parties other than alcoa these disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on alcoa’s businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects or the businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects of the independent companies resulting from the separation the effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the completion of the separation

litigation 

italian energy matter 

as previously reported before 2002 alcoa purchased power in italy in the regulated energy market and received a drawback of a portion of the price of power under a special tariff in an amount calculated in accordance with a 

  

published resolution of the italian energy authority energy authority resolution n 2041999 “2041999” in 2001 the energy authority published another resolution which clarified that the drawback would be calculated in the same manner and in the same amount in either the regulated or unregulated market at the beginning of 2002 alcoa left the regulated energy market to purchase energy in the unregulated market subsequently in 2004 the energy authority introduced regulation no 1482004 which set forth a different method for calculating the special tariff that would result in a different drawback for the regulated and unregulated markets alcoa challenged the new regulation in the administrative court of milan and received a favorable judgment in 2006 following this ruling alcoa continued to receive the power price drawback in accordance with the original calculation method through 2009 when the european commission declared all such special tariffs to be impermissible “state aid” in 2010 the energy authority appealed the 2006 ruling to the consiglio di stato final court of appeal on december 2 2011 the consiglio di stato ruled in favor of the energy authority and against alcoa thus presenting the opportunity for the energy regulators to seek reimbursement from alcoa of an amount equal to the difference between the actual drawback amounts received over the relevant time period and the drawback as it would have been calculated in accordance with regulation 1482004 on february 23 2012 alcoa filed its appeal of the decision of the consiglio di stato this appeal was subsequently withdrawn in march 2013 on march 26 2012 alcoa received a letter from the agency cassa conguaglio per il settore eletrico ccse responsible for making and collecting payments on behalf of the energy authority demanding payment in the amount of approximately 110 million €85 million including interest by letter dated april 5 2012 alcoa informed ccse that it disputes the payment demand of ccse since i ccse was not authorized by the consiglio di stato decisions to seek payment of any amount ii the decision of the consiglio di stato has been appealed see above and iii in any event no interest should be payable on april 29 2012 law no 44 of 2012 “442012” came into effect changing the method to calculate the drawback on february 21 2013 alcoa received a revised request letter from ccse demanding alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl make a payment in the amount of 97 million €76 million including interest which reflects a revised calculation methodology by ccse and represents the high end of the range of reasonably possible loss associated with this matter of 0 to 97 million €76 million alcoa has rejected that demand and has formally challenged it through an appeal before the administrative court on april 5 2013 the administrative court scheduled a hearing for december 19 2013 which was subsequently postponed until april 17 2014 and further postponed until june 19 2014 on this date the administrative court listened to alcoa’s oral argument and on september 2 2014 rendered its decision the administrative court declared the payment request of ccse and the energy authority to alcoa to be unsubstantiated based on the 1482004 resolution with respect to the january 19 2007 through november 19 2009 timeframe on december 18 2014 the ccse and the energy authority appealed the administrative court’s september 2 2014 decision however a date for the hearing has not been scheduled as a result of the conclusion of the european commission matter on january 26 2016 described below the company has modified its outlook with respect to a portion of the pending legal proceedings related to this matter at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate outcome for this matter 

european commission matter 

as previously reported in july 2006 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy to some energyintensive industries complied with european union eu state aid rules the italian power tariff extended the tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 alcoa had been incurring higher power costs at its smelters in italy subsequent to the tariff end date through the end of 2012 the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 prior to expiration of the tariff in 2005 alcoa had been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government the ec’s announcement expressed concerns about whether italy’s extension of the tariff beyond 2005 was compatible with eu legislation and potentially distorted competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs 

  

on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and therefore the italian government is to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest the amount of this recovery was to be based on a calculation prepared by the italian government see below in late 2009 after discussions with legal counsel and reviewing the bases on which the ec decided including the different considerations cited in the ec decision regarding alcoa’s two smelters in italy alcoa recorded a charge of 250 million €173 million which included 20 million €14 million to write off a receivable from the italian government for amounts due under the now expired tariff structure and 230 million €159 million to establish a reserve on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal of this decision with the general court of the eu see below prior to 2012 alcoa was involved in other legal proceedings related to this matter that separately sought the annulment of the ec’s july 2006 decision to open an investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules and requested injunctive relief to suspend the effectiveness of the ec’s november 19 2009 decision however the decisions by the general court and subsequent appeals to the european court of justice resulted in the denial of these remedies 

in june 2012 alcoa received formal notification from the italian government with a calculated recovery amount of 375 million €303 million this amount was reduced by 65 million €53 million for amounts owed by the italian government to alcoa resulting in a net payment request of 310 million €250 million in a notice published in the official journal of the european union on september 22 2012 the ec announced that it had filed an action against the italian government on july 18 2012 to compel it to collect the recovery amount on october 17 2013 the european court of justice ordered italy to so collect on september 27 2012 alcoa received a request for payment in full of the 310 million €250 million by october 31 2012 following discussions with the italian government regarding the timing of such payment alcoa paid the requested amount in five quarterly installments of 69 million €50 million beginning in october 2012 through december 2013 notwithstanding the payments made alcoa’s estimate of the most probable loss of the ultimate outcome of this matter and the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss which is 174 million €159 million to 332 million €303 million remains the 174 million €159 million recorded in 2009 the us dollar amount reflects the effects of foreign currency movements since 2009 alcoa no longer has a reserve for this matter instead alcoa has a noncurrent asset reflecting the excess of the total of the five payments made to the italian government over the reserve recorded in 2009 at december 31 2015 the noncurrent asset was 100 million €91 million this does not include the 58 million €53 million for amounts owed by the italian government to alcoa mentioned above 

on october 16 2014 alcoa received notice from the general court of the eu that its april 19 2010 appeal of the ec’s november 19 2009 decision was denied on december 27 2014 alcoa filed an appeal of the general court’s october 16 2014 ruling to the european court of justice ecj following submission of the ec’s response to the appeal on june 10 2015 alcoa filed a request for an oral hearing before the ecj no decision on that request was received on january 26 2016 alcoa was informed that the ecj had dismissed alcoa’s december 27 2014 appeal of the general court’s october 16 2014 ruling the dismissal of alcoa’s appeal represents the conclusion of the legal proceedings in this matter there will be no further reporting of this matter 

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites the most significant of these matters including the remediation of the grasse river in massena ny are discussed in the environmental matters section of note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on pages 130134 

as previously reported in august 2005 dany lavoie a resident of baie comeau in the canadian province of québec filed a motion for authorization to institute a class action and for designation of a class representative against alcoa canada ltd alcoa limitée societe canadienne de metaux reynolds limitée and canadian british aluminum in the 

  

superior court of québec in the district of baie comeau plaintiff seeks to institute the class action on behalf of a putative class consisting of all past present and future owners tenants and residents of baie comeau’s st georges neighborhood he alleges that defendants as the present and past owners and operators of an aluminum smelter in baie comeau have negligently allowed the emission of certain contaminants from the smelter specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or “pahs” that have been deposited on the lands and houses of the st georges neighborhood and its environs causing damage to the property of the putative class and causing health concerns for those who inhabit that neighborhood plaintiff originally moved to certify a class action sought to compel additional remediation to be conducted by the defendants beyond that already undertaken by them voluntarily sought an injunction against further emissions in excess of a limit to be determined by the court in consultation with an independent expert and sought money damages on behalf of all class members in may 2007 the court authorized a class action suit to include only people who suffered property damage or personal injury damages caused by the emission of pahs from the smelter in september 2007 plaintiffs filed the claim against the original defendants which the court had authorized in may alcoa has filed its statement of defense and plaintiffs filed an answer to that statement alcoa also filed a motion for particulars with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiffs’ answer and a motion to strike with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiffs’ answer in late 2010 the court denied these motions the soderberg smelting process that plaintiffs allege to be the source of emissions of concern has ceased operations and has been dismantled no further formal court proceedings or discovery has occurred while technical advisors nominated by agreement of the parties confer on potential health impacts of prior emissions this protocol has been agreed to by the parties who have also advised the court regarding the process plaintiffs have filed a motion seeking appointment of an expert to advise the court on matters of sampling of homes and standards for interior home remediation alcoa has announced its opposition to that motion although initially setting a schedule for briefing during january 2016 the court notified the parties that it was suspending that schedule until further notice no further schedule has been set further proceedings in the case will await resolution of the motion at this stage of the proceeding the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

as previously reported in october 2006 in barnett et al v alcoa and alcoa fuels inc warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601pl499 fortyone plaintiffs sued alcoa inc and a subsidiary asserting claims similar to those asserted in musgrave v alcoa et al warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601ct006 in november 2007 alcoa inc and its subsidiary filed a motion to dismiss the barnett cases in october 2008 the warrick county circuit court granted alcoa’s motions to dismiss dismissing all claims arising out of alleged occupational exposure to wastes at the squaw creek mine but in november 2008 the trial court clarified its ruling indicating that the order does not dispose of plaintiffs’ personal injury claims based upon alleged “recreational” or nonoccupational exposure plaintiffs also filed a “second amended complaint” in response to the court’s orders granting alcoa’s motion to dismiss on july 7 2010 the court granted the parties’ joint motions for a general continuance of trial settings discovery in this matter remains stayed  the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss because plaintiffs have merely alleged that their medical condition is attributable to exposure to materials at the squaw creek mine but no further information is available due to the discovery stay 

as previously reported in 1996 alcoa acquired the fusina italy smelter and rolling operations and the portovesme italy smelter both of which are owned by alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl from alumix an entity owned by the italian government alcoa also acquired the extrusion plants located in feltre and bolzano italy at the time of the acquisition alumix indemnified alcoa for preexisting environmental contamination at the sites in 2004 the italian ministry of environment moe issued orders to alcoa trasformazioni srl and alumix for the development of a cleanup plan related to soil contamination in excess of allowable limits under legislative decree and to institute emergency actions and pay natural resource damages on april 5 2006 alcoa trasformazioni srl’s fusina site was also sued by the moe and minister of public works mopw in the civil court of venice for an alleged liability for environmental damages in parallel with the orders already issued by the moe alcoa trasformazioni srl appealed the orders defended the civil case for environmental damages and filed suit against alumix as discussed below similar issues also existed with respect to the bolzano and feltre plants based on orders 

  

issued by local authorities in 2006 most if not all of the underlying activities occurred during the ownership of alumix the governmental entity that sold the italian plants to alcoa 

as noted above in response to the 2006 civil suit by the moe and mopw alcoa trasformazioni srl filed suit against alumix claiming indemnification under the original acquisition agreement but brought that suit in the court of rome due to jurisdictional rules in june 2008 the parties alcoa and now ligestra srl ligestra the successor to alumix signed a preliminary agreement by which they have committed to pursue a settlement the court of rome accepted the request and postponed the court’s expert technical assessment reserving its ability to fix the deadline depending on the development of negotiations alcoa and ligestra agreed to a settlement in december 2008 with respect to the feltre site ligestra paid the sum of 108 million euros and alcoa committed to clean up the site further postponements were granted by the court of rome and the next hearing is fixed for december 20 2016 in the meantime alcoa trasformazioni srl and ligestra reached a preliminary agreement for settlement of the liabilities related to fusina allocating 80 and 20 of the remediation costs to ligestra and alcoa respectively in january 2014 a final agreement with ligestra was signed and on february 5 2014 alcoa signed a final agreement with the moe and mopw settling all environmental issues at the fusina site as set out in the agreement between alcoa and ligestra those two parties will share the remediation costs and environmental damages claimed by the moe and mopw the remediation project filed by alcoa and ligestra has been approved by the moe see note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “fusina and portovesme italy” on page 131 to provide time for settlement with ligestra the moe and alcoa jointly requested and the civil court of venice has granted a series of postponements of hearings in the venice trial assuming that the case will be closed following the settlement the parties caused the court to dismiss the proceedings the proceedings were however restarted in april 2015 by the moe and mopw because the ministers had not ratified the settlement of february 5 2014 the ministers announced in december 2015 that they will ratify the settlement in the following months 

alcoa and ligestra have signed a similar agreement relating to the portovesme site however that agreement is contingent upon final acceptance of the proposed soil remediation project for portovesme that was rejected by the moe in the fourth quarter of 2013 alcoa submitted a revised proposal in may 2014 and a further revised proposal in february 2015 in agreement with ligestra the moe issued a ministerial decree approving the final project in october 2015 work on the soil remediation project will commence in 2016 and is expected to be completed in 2019 alcoa and ligestra are now working on a final groundwater remediation project which is expected to be submitted to the moe for review during 2016 while the issuance of the decree for the soil remediation project has provided reasonable certainty regarding liability for the soil remediation with respect to the groundwater remediation project alcoa is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss beyond what is described in footnote n to the consolidated financial statements for several reasons first certain costs relating to the groundwater remediation are not yet fixed in connection with any proposed groundwater remediation plan for portovesme the company understands that the moe has substantial discretion in defining what must be managed under italian law as well as the extent and duration of that remediation program as a result the scope and cost of the final groundwater remediation plan remain uncertain for portovesme alcoa and ligestra are still negotiating a final settlement for groundwater remediation at portovesme for an allocation of the cost based on the new remediation project approved by the moe in addition once a groundwater remediation project is submitted should a final settlement with ligestra not be reached alcoa should be held responsible only for its share of pollution however the area is impacted by many sources of pollution as well as historical pollution consequently the allocation of liabilities would need a very complex technical evaluation by the authorities that has not yet been performed 

as previously reported on november 30 2010 alcoa world alumina brasil ltda awab received notice of a lawsuit that had been filed by the public prosecutors of the state of pará in brazil in november 2009 the suit names awab and the state of pará which through its environmental agency had issued the operating license for the company’s new bauxite mine in juruti the suit concerns the impact of the project on the region’s water system and alleges that certain conditions of the original installation license were not met by awab in the lawsuit plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction suspending the operating license and ordering payment of compensation on april 14 2010 the court denied plaintiffs’ request awab presented its defense in march 2011 on grounds that it was in compliance with the terms and conditions of its operating license which included plans to mitigate the impact of the 

  

project on the region’s water system in april 2011 the state of pará defended itself in the case asserting that the operating license contains the necessary plans to mitigate such impact that the state monitors the performance of awab’s obligations arising out of such license that the licensing process is valid and legal and that the suit is meritless the company’s position is that any impact from the project had been fully repaired when the suit was filed the company also believes that jará lake has not been affected by any project activity and any evidence of pollution from the project would be unreliable following the preliminary injunction request the plaintiffs took no further action until october 2014 when in response to the court’s request and as required by statute they restated the original allegations in the lawsuit the company is not certain whether or when the action will proceed given that this proceeding is in its preliminary stage and the current uncertainty in this case the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss

tax 

as previously reported in september 2010 following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years an assessment was received as a result of spain’s tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a spanish consolidated tax group owned by the company an appeal of this assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court by the company was denied in october 2013 in december 2013 the company filed an appeal of the assessment in spain’s national court 

additionally following a corporate income tax audit of the same spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax years spain’s tax authorities issued an assessment in july 2013 similarly disallowing certain interest deductions in august 2013 the company filed an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court which was denied in january 2015 the company filed an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s national court in march 2015 

the combined assessments remeasured for a tax rate change enacted in november 2014 total 263 million €241 million the company believes it has meritorious arguments to support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through spain’s court system however in the event the company is unsuccessful a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available to the spanish consolidated tax group additionally it is possible that the company may receive similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2009 at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter 

as previously reported between 2000 and 2002 alcoa alumínio alumínio sold approximately 2000 metric tons of metal per month from its poços de caldas facility located in the state of minas gerais the “state” to alfio a customer also located in the state sales in the state were exempted from valueadded tax vat requirements alfio subsequently sold metal to customers outside of the state but did not pay the required vat on those transactions in july 2002 alumínio received an assessment from state auditors on the theory that alumínio should be jointly and severally liable with alfio for the unpaid vat in june 2003 the administrative tribunal found alumínio liable and alumínio filed a judicial case in the state in february 2004 contesting the finding in may 2005 the court of first instance found alumínio solely liable and a panel of a state appeals court confirmed this finding in april 2006 

  

alumínio filed a special appeal to the superior tribunal of justice stj in brasilia the federal capital of brazil later in 2006 in 2011 the stj through one of its judges reversed the judgment of the lower courts finding that alumínio should neither be solely nor jointly and severally liable with alfio for the vat which ruling was then appealed by the state in august 2012 the stj agreed to have the case reheard before a fivejudge panel a decision from this panel is pending but additional appeals are likely at december 31 2015 the assessment totaled 35 million r135 million including penalties and interest while the company believes it has meritorious defenses the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome 

other contingencies 

in addition to the matters discussed above various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against alcoa including those pertaining to environmental product liability safety and health and tax matters while the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that the company’s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on the financial position of the company

overview 

our business 

alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing alcoa’s innovative multimaterial products which include aluminum titanium and nickel are used worldwide in aerospace automotive commercial transportation packaging building and construction oil and gas defense consumer electronics and industrial applications 

  

alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina combined through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry technology mining refining smelting fabricating and recycling aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily sales of primary aluminum and alumina represent approximately 40 of alcoa’s revenues the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 

alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries based upon the country where the point of sale occurred the united states and europe generated 55 and 26 respectively of alcoa’s sales in 2015 in addition alcoa has investments and operating activities in among others australia brazil china guinea iceland russia and saudi arabia governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates affect the results of operations in these countries 

management review of 2015 and outlook for the future 

in 2015 growth in global aluminum demand reached 6 which was slightly less than management’s projection 7 at the end of 2014 however significant market headwinds negatively impacted the smelting portion of alcoa’s upstream operations as the average lme price on 15day lag of aluminum declined 10 and regional premiums decreased substantially 39 in the united states and canada and 44 in europe compared to 2014 the refining portion of the upstream operations continued to make progress in shifting customer pricing away from the lme aluminum price to a mixture of alumina indexspot pricing however this was overshadowed by a decrease in the average alumina indexspot price conversely alcoa’s upstream operations realized the benefit of a stronger us dollar in 2015 compared to 2014 in the midstream operations aftertax operating income was stable in 2015 from 2014 despite generating 1052 less revenue due to the closure and divestiture of six rolling mills while the downstream operations received the benefit of 1310 in combined revenue combined from three acquisitions across all operations cost headwinds continued to be a challenge however management was able to more than offset these with net productivity improvements 

separate from the 2015 operational results management initiated a number of portfolio actions during the year in the upstream operations following similar actions taken in both 2014 and 2013 smelting capacity of 217 kmt was curtailed another 230 kmt will be curtailed by the end of june 2016 and 96 kmt all of which was previously curtailed was permanently closed another 269 kmt will be closed by the end of march 2016 additionally refining capacity of 1705 kmt was curtailed another 1635 kmt will be curtailed by the end of june 2016 management also completed the divestiture of another rolling mill three rolling mills were previously divested in december 2014 in the midstream operations that was no longer part of the strategic direction of alcoa from a growth perspective alcoa completed the acquisition of two businesses mostly aerospacerelated both of which will enhance the portfolio of alcoa’s downstream operations 

as a result of the previously mentioned capacity reductions alcoa’s 2015 results were negatively impacted by significant restructuring charges related to these actions additionally developments in legal matters in italy an assessment of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets and an impairment of goodwill caused unfavorable impacts in alcoa’s 2015 results 

management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies overhead rationalization and disciplined capital spending this focus and the related results enabled alcoa to end 2015 with a solid financial position consistent with the end of 2014 

the following financial information reflects certain key measures of alcoa’s 2015 results 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 in 2016 management is projecting continued growth increase of 6 in the global consumption of primary aluminum a slight change from that of the last four years led by china at an estimated 8 all other regions in the world except for brazil and russia both are projected to be flat with 2015 are expected to have positive growth in aluminum demand over 2015 including north america at an estimated 5 after considering forecasted added production along with expected industrywide capacity reductions both of which are mainly driven by china management anticipates a deficit in the aluminum market for alumina growth in global consumption is estimated to be 6 and demand is expected to slightly exceed supply due to capacity reductions in china as well as other parts of the world 

management also anticipates improved market conditions for valueadd products in the aerospace building and construction packaging automotive and industrial gas turbine global end markets despite declines in certain regions while the commercial transportation global end market is expected to decrease many of the conditions that drove these markets in 2015 will continue throughout 2016 

aerospace is expected to be driven by large commercial aircraft due to a greater than nineyear order backlog for building and construction awarded nonresidential contracts are projected to be up once again in north america while a slight decline in europe is expected in packaging growth in china and europe mainly driven by the penetration of aluminum in the growing beer segment and the conversion from steel cans to aluminum cans respectively is expected to more than offset a slight decrease in north america for automotive growth is anticipated in the united states due to the replacement of older vehicles low borrowing rates and the decline in gasoline prices and china due to evolving emissions policies based on new clean air legislation enacted in 2014 and a continued increase in the percentage of the population driving automobiles as well as europe industrial gas turbines are expected to see growth as a result of new demand for high technology turbines and upgrades of existing turbines in commercial transportation improving conditions in both europe and china are expected to be more than offset by weakness in north america due to high inventory levels as a result of one of the highest production years ever in 2015 and projected lower orders 

looking ahead over the next year management will continue to focus on lowering alcoa’s refining and smelting operations on the respective global cost curves to the 21st and 38th percentiles respectively at december 31 2015 alcoa’s refining operations were at the 23rd percentile a twopercentage point improvement from 2014 and its smelting operations remained at the 43rd percentile on the respective global cost curves actions taken to improve alcoa’s position on the global alumina cost curve included in late 2014 the sale of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica and the conversion of the fuel source from fuel oil to natural gas at a refinery in spain and in 2015 the curtailment of 1330 kmt of highcost capacity in suriname actions taken in the smelting operations included in late 2014 the sale of an ownership interest in a smelter in the united states and the renewal of a power contract at each of the three smelters in canada and in 2015 the curtailment and closure of 170 kmt combined of highcost capacity in brazil also both the refining and smelting operations benefitted from productivity improvements new initiatives as well as the full realization of those implemented in 2014 while the benefits of the actions in the refining operations can be seen in alcoa’s improved position on the global alumina cost curve at the end of 2015 the benefits from the actions in the smelting operations were offset by a downward shift in the global aluminum cost curve primarily due to the strong us dollar and curtailmentsclosures of capacity from other smelting industry participants 

  

  

other actions taken in 2015 to help drive a lower position on the respective global cost curves include additional curtailments andor closures of 2100 kmt of refining capacity and 499 kmt of smelting capacity all within the united states the initiation of these actions occurred late in 2015 and will be completed during the first half of 2016 therefore management expects to realize the benefits of curtailingclosing this highcost capacity during 2016 additionally alcoa has initiatives to drive further productivity improvements during 2016 including from procurement and overhead programs furthermore the smelter and the refinery at the joint venture in saudi arabia are expected to provide a twopercentage point reduction on each of the respective global cost curves by the end of 2016 from 2013 

management will also continue to focus on revenue growth for both the midstream and downstream operations which is expected from multiple sources the midstream operations anticipate positive contributions from both the davenport ia rolling mill facility and tennessee rolling mill facility expansion completed in september 2015 both of which serve the growing demand for aluminum sheet in the us automotive and market as a result of changing emission regulations likewise the downstream operations expect favorable results from projects completed in late 2014 and throughout 2015 to meet growing demand in both the aerospace and commercial transportation end markets these projects include an expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in lafayette in expansions in laporte in and hampton va to provide nickelbased super alloy structural components and airfoil blades for jet engines and an expansion at a facility in hungary to double production of aluminum wheels additionally the downstream operations completed three acquisitions mostly aerospacerelated in november 2014 through july 2015 see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations below that will incrementally increase revenue furthermore in 2014 and 2015 alcoa entered into a number of multiyear supply agreements related to the aerospace end market valued at approximately 13500 including six contracts valued at more than 6700 combined with four major customers in the aerospace end market under one of these six contracts the midstream operations will supply aluminum sheet and plate and under the other five contracts the downstream operations will supply jet engine components including aluminum and aluminumlithium fan blades multimaterial fastening systems titanium plate and billet and titanium seat track assemblies 

in addition to focusing on the abovementioned operational improvements management has committed to executing the following transaction on september 28 2015 alcoa announced that its board of directors approved a plan to separate into two independent publiclytraded companies one company will comprise the alumina and primary metals segments and the other company will comprise the global rolled products engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutions segments alcoa is targeting to complete the separation in the second half of 2016 the transaction is subject to a number of conditions including but not limited to final approval by alcoa’s board of directors receipt of a favorable opinion of legal counsel with respect to the taxfree nature of the transaction for us federal income tax purposes and the effectiveness of a form 10 registration statement to be filed with the us securities and exchange commission upon completion of the separation alcoa shareholders will own all of the outstanding shares of both companies alcoa may at any time and for any reason until the proposed transaction is complete abandon the separation plan or modify or change its terms 

results of operations 

earnings summary 

net loss attributable to alcoa for 2015 was 322 or 031 per diluted share compared with net income attributable to alcoa of 268 or 021 per share in 2014 the decrease in results of 590 was mostly due to a lower average realized price for both aluminum and alumina a charge for legal matters in italy unfavorable priceproduct mix in the midstream and downstream operations an unfavorable change in income taxes due to a higher amount of discrete income tax charges and nondeductible items lower energy sales and higher costs these negative impacts were partially offset by net favorable foreign currency movements net productivity improvements higher volume in the midstream and downstream operations and lower charges and expenses related to a number of portfolio actions eg capacity reductions divestitures acquisitions 

  

net income attributable to alcoa for 2014 was 268 or 021 per share compared with net loss attributable to alcoa of 2285 or 214 per share in 2013 the improvement in results of 2553 was primarily due to the absence of all of the following an impairment of goodwill a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and charges for the resolution of a legal matter other significant changes in results included the following higher energy sales a higher average realized price for primary aluminum net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements these other changes were mostly offset by higher charges and expenses related to a number of portfolio actions eg capacity reductions divestitures acquisitions higher overall input costs and an unfavorable change in income taxes due to higher operating results 

sales —sales for 2015 were 22534 compared with sales of 23906 in 2014 a decline of 1372 or 6 the decrease was primarily due to the absence of sales related to capacity that was closed sold or curtailed in the midstream and upstream operations see global rolled products and primary metals in segment information below a lower average realized price for aluminum in both the upstream and midstream operations and for alumina in the upstream operations unfavorable foreign currency movements in the midstream and downstream operations and lower energy sales both as a result of lower pricing and unfavorable foreign currency movements these negative impacts were partially offset by the addition of sales from three recently acquired businesses see engineered products and solutions in segment information below higher volume across all segments favorable product mix in the midstream operations and higher buyresell activity for primary aluminum 

sales for 2014 were 23906 compared with sales of 23032 in 2013 an improvement of 874 or 4 the increase was mainly the result of higher volumes in the midstream downstream and alumina portion of the upstream operations higher energy sales resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity increased buyresell activity for primary aluminum and a higher average realized price for primary aluminum these positive impacts were partially offset by lower primary aluminum volumes including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity and unfavorable priceproduct mix in the midstream operations 

cost of goods sold —cogs as a percentage of sales was 802 in 2015 compared with 801 in 2014 the percentage was negatively impacted by a lower average realized price for both aluminum and alumina in the upstream operations unfavorable priceproduct mix in the midstream and downstream operations lower energy sales and higher costs these negative impacts were mostly offset by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar net productivity improvements across all segments higher volume in the midstream and downstream operations a favorable lifo last in first out adjustment due to lower prices for aluminum and alumina 208 lower inventory writedowns related to the decisions to permanently shut down andor curtail capacity in the upstream and midstream operations difference of 23—see restructuring and other charges below and the absence of costs related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at 10 locations in the united states see below 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 801 in 2014 compared with 837 in 2013 the percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments both the previously mentioned higher energy sales and higher average realized price for primary aluminum net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar lower costs for caustic and carbon and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in australia these positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs for bauxite energy and labor higher inventory writedowns related to the decisions to permanently shut down certain smelter and rolling mill capacity difference of 58—see restructuring and other charges below and costs related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at 10 locations in the united states see below 

on june 6 2014 the united steelworkers ratified a new fiveyear labor agreement covering approximately 6100 employees at 10 us locations the previous labor agreement expired on may 15 2014 in 2014 as a result of the preparation for and ratification of the new agreement alcoa recognized 18 12 aftertax in cogs for among other items business contingency costs and a onetime signing bonus for employees additionally as a result of the provisions of the new labor agreement a significant plan amendment was adopted by one of alcoa’s us pension plans accordingly this plan was required to be remeasured which resulted in a 13 decrease to 2014 net periodic benefit cost 

  

selling general administrative and other expenses —sga expenses were 979 or 43 of sales in 2015 compared with 995 or 42 of sales in 2014 the decrease of 16 was principally the result of favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar the absence of sga related to closed and sold locations and lower acquisition costs 15 partially offset by expenses for professional and consulting services related to the planned separation of alcoa 24—see management review of 2015 and outlook for the future above and new sga related to inorganic growth in the engineered products and solutions segment 

sga expenses were 995 or 42 of sales in 2014 compared with 1008 or 44 of sales in 2013 the decline of 13 was due to decreases in various expenses including legal and consulting fees and contract services mostly offset by costs associated with the acquisition of firth rixson 42—see engineered products and solutions in segment information below and higher stockbased compensation expense 

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 238 in 2015 compared with 218 in 2014 and 192 in 2013 the increase in 2015 as compared to 2014 was mainly driven by additional spending related to the upgrade of a micromill™ in san antonio tx which was completed during 2015 and began production of automotive sheet on a limited basis for the global rolled products segment and additive manufacturing for 3d printing partially offset by lower spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the primary metals segment the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily caused by spending related to an upgrade of a micromill™ in san antonio tx for the global rolled products segment and additional spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the primary metals segment 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1280 in 2015 compared with 1371 in 2014 the decrease of 91 or 7 was mostly due to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar particularly against the australian dollar and brazilian real and the absence of dda 71 related to the divestiture andor permanent closure of five smelters six rolling mills one refinery and one rod mill see alumina primary metals and global rolled products in segment information below all of which occurred from march 2014 through june 2015 these positive impacts were partially offset by new dda 93 associated with three acquisitions that occurred from november 2014 through july 2015 see engineered products and solutions in segment information below 

the provision for dda was 1371 in 2014 compared with 1421 in 2013 the decrease of 50 or 4 was principally the result of favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar particularly against the australian dollar and brazilian real and a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in australia canada the united states and italy that occurred at different points during both 2013 and 2014 see primary metals in segment information below these items were somewhat offset by new dda associated with both the acquisition of firth rixson in november 2014 see engineered products and solutions in segment information below and assets placed into service in january 2014 related to the completed automotive expansion at the davenport ia plant 

impairment of goodwill— in 2015 and 2013 alcoa recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of 25 and 1731 1719 after noncontrolling interest respectively related to the annual impairment review of the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil and the primary metals segment respectively see goodwill in critical accounting policies and estimates below 

  

restructuring and other charges— restructuring and other charges for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2015 were comprised of the following 

 

 layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 

2015 actions in 2015 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 1195 836 aftertax and noncontrolling interest which were comprised of the following components 438 281 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for exit costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and demolish three smelters and a power station see below 246 118 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for the curtailment of two refineries and two smelters see below 201 pre and aftertax related to legal matters in italy a 161 151 aftertax and noncontrolling interest net loss related to the march 2015 divestiture of a rolling mill in russia see global rolled products in segment information below and postclosing adjustments associated with three december 2014 divestitures 143 102 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for layoff costs including the separation of approximately 2100 employees 425 in the transportation and construction solutions segment 645 in the engineered products and solutions segment 380 in the primary metals segment 90 in the global rolled products segment 85 in the alumina segment and 475 in corporate 34 14 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for asset impairments virtually all of which was related to prior capitalized costs for an expansion project at a refinery in australia that is no longer being pursued an 18 13 aftertax gain on the sale of land related to one of the rolling mills in australia that was permanently closed in december 2014 see 2014 actions below a net charge of 4 a net credit of 7 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for other miscellaneous items and 14 11 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods 

during 2015 management initiated various alumina refining and aluminum smelting capacity curtailments andor closures the curtailments were composed of the remaining capacity at all of the following the são luís smelter in brazil 74 kmtperyear the suriname refinery 1330 kmtperyear the point comfort tx refinery 2010 kmtperyear and the wenatchee wa smelter 143 kmtperyear all of the curtailments were completed in 2015 except for 1635 kmtperyear at the point comfort refinery which is expected to be completed by the end of june 2016 the permanent closures were composed of the capacity at the warrick in smelter 269 kmtperyear includes the closure of a related coal mine and the infrastructure of the massena east ny smelter potlines were previously shut down in both 2013 and 2014—see 2013 actions and 2014 actions below as the modernization of this smelter is no longer being pursued the shutdown of the warrick smelter is expected to be completed by the end of march 2016 

the decisions on the above actions were part of a separate 12month review in refining 2800 kmtperyear and smelting 500 kmtperyear capacity initiated by management in march 2015 for possible curtailment partial or full permanent closure or divestiture while many factors contributed to each decision in general these actions were initiated to maintain competitiveness amid prevailing market conditions for both alumina and aluminum demolition and remediation activities related to the warrick smelter and the massena east location will begin in 2016 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 

separate from the actions initiated under the reviews described above in mid2015 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the poços de caldas smelter capacity of 96 kmtperyear in brazil and the 

  

anglesea power station includes the closure of a related coal mine in australia the entire capacity at poços de caldas had been temporarily idled since may 2014 and the anglesea power station was shut down at the end of august 2015 demolition and remediation activities related to the poços de caldas smelter and the anglesea power station began in late 2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2026 and 2020 respectively 

the decision on the poços de caldas smelter was due to management’s conclusion that the smelter was no longer competitive as a result of challenging global market conditions for primary aluminum which led to the initial curtailment that have not dissipated and higher costs for the anglesea power station the decision was made because a sale process did not result in a sale and there would have been imminent operating costs and financial constraints related to this site in the remainder of 2015 and beyond including significant costs to source coal from available resources necessary maintenance costs and a depressed outlook for forward electricity prices the anglesea power station previously supplied approximately 40 percent of the power needs for the point henry smelter which was closed in august 2014 see 2014 actions below 

in 2015 costs related to the shutdown and curtailment actions included asset impairments of 217 representing the writeoff of the remaining book value of all related properties plants and equipment 156 for the layoff of approximately 3100 employees 1800 in the primary metals segment and 1300 in the alumina segment including 30 in pension costs accelerated depreciation of 84 related to certain facilities as they continued to operate during 2015 and 227 in other exit costs additionally in 2015 remaining inventories mostly operating supplies and raw materials were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 90 43 aftertax and noncontrolling interest which was recorded in cogs the other exit costs of 227 represent 76 in asset retirement obligations and 86 in environmental remediation both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in the united states brazil and australia includes the rehabilitation of a related coal mine in each of australia and the united states and 65 in supplier and customer contractrelated costs 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 1500 of the 5200 employees were separated the remaining separations for 2015 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2016 in 2015 cash payments of 42 were made against layoff reserves related to 2015 restructuring programs 

2014 actions in 2014 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 1168 703 aftertax and noncontrolling interest which were comprised of the following components 693 443 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for exit costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and demolish three smelters and two rolling mills see below a 332 163 aftertax and noncontrolling interest net loss for the divestitures of four operations see alumina primary metals and global rolled products in segment information below 68 45 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for the temporary curtailment of two smelters and a related production slowdown at one refinery see below 51 36 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for layoff costs including the separation of approximately 1120 employees 470 in the engineered products and solutions segment 360 in the transportation and construction solutions segment 45 in the global rolled products segment 60 in the alumina and primary metals segments combined and 185 in corporate 34 26 aftertax for asset impairments related to prior capitalized costs for a modernization project at a smelter in canada that is no longer being pursued a net charge of 18 11 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for other miscellaneous items including 2 2 aftertax for asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and 28 21 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods including those associated with a smelter in italy due to changes in facts and circumstances see below 

in early 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the remaining capacity 84 kmtperyear at the massena east ny smelter and the full capacity 190 kmtperyear at the point henry smelter in australia the capacity at massena east was fully shut down by the end of march 2014 and the point henry smelter was fully shut down in august 2014 demolition and remediation activities related to both the massena east and point henry smelters began in late 2014 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and 2018 respectively 

the decisions on the massena east and point henry smelters were part of a 15month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in may 2013 see 2013 actions below for possible curtailment through this review 

  

management determined that the remaining capacity of the massena east smelter was no longer competitive and the point henry smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable management also initiated the temporary curtailment of the remaining capacity 62 kmtperyear at the poços de caldas smelter and additional capacity 85 kmtperyear at the são luís smelter both in brazil these curtailments were completed by the end of may 2014 as a result of these curtailments 200 kmtperyear of production at the poços de caldas refinery was reduced by the end of june 2014 

also in early 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown of alcoa’s two rolling mills in australia point henry and yennora this decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both australia and asia the two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmtperyear and were closed by the end of 2014 demolition and remediation activities related to the two rolling mills began in mid2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018 

additionally in august 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the capacity 150 kmtperyear at the portovesme smelter in italy which had been idle since november 2012 this decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged including the lack of a viable longterm power solution demolition and remediation activities related to the portovesme smelter will begin in 2016 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 delayed due to discussions with the italian government and other stakeholders 

in 2014 costs related to the shutdown and curtailment actions included 208 for the layoff of approximately 1790 employees 1210 in the primary metals segment 470 in the global rolled products segment 80 in the alumina segment and 30 in corporate including 26 in pension costs accelerated depreciation of 204 related to the three facilities in australia as they continued to operate during 2014 asset impairments of 166 representing the writeoff of the remaining book value of all related properties plants and equipment and 183 in other exit costs additionally in 2014 remaining inventories mostly operating supplies and raw materials were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 67 47 aftertax and noncontrolling interest which was recorded in cogs the other exit costs of 183 represent 95 in asset retirement obligations and 42 in environmental remediation both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in australia italy and the united states and 46 in other related costs including supplier and customer contractrelated costs 

as of december 31 2015 approximately 2500 of the 2870 employees previously 2910 were separated the total number of employees associated with 2014 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees who were initially identified for separation accepting other positions within alcoa and natural attrition the remaining separations for 2014 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2016 in 2015 and 2014 cash payments of 62 and 141 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to 2014 restructuring programs 

2013 actions in 2013 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 782 585 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 391 305 aftertax and noncontrolling interest related to the resolution of a legal matter 245 183 aftertax for exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations see below 87 61 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for layoff costs including the separation of approximately 1110 employees 340 in the primary metals segment 250 in the global rolled products segment 220 in the engineered products and solutions segment 85 in the alumina segment 75 in the transportation and construction solutions segment and 140 in corporate of which 590 relates to a global overhead reduction program and 9 in pension plan settlement charges related to previously separated employees 25 17 aftertax in net charges including 12 8 aftertax for asset impairments related to retirements andor the sale of previously idled structures 25 13 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for asset impairments related to the writeoff of capitalized costs for projects no longer being pursued due to the market environment a net charge of 17 12 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other miscellaneous items including 3 2 aftertax for asset impairments and 8 6 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods 

in may 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines capacity of 105 kmtperyear that utilize soderberg technology at the baie comeau smelter in québec canada remaining capacity of 280 

  

kmtperyear composed of two prebake potlines and the full capacity 44 kmtperyear at the fusina smelter in italy additionally in august 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline capacity of 41 kmtperyear that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east ny smelter remaining capacity of 84 kmtperyear composed of two soderberg potlines the aforementioned soderberg lines at baie comeau and massena east were fully shut down by the end of september 2013 while the fusina smelter was previously temporarily idled in 2010 demolition and remediation activities related to all three facilities began in late 2013 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2016 for massena east and by the end of 2017 for both baie comeau and fusina 

the decisions on the soderberg lines for baie comeau and massena east were part of a 15month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in may 2013 for possible curtailment while the decision on the fusina smelter was in addition to the capacity being reviewed factors leading to all three decisions were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution italy changed market fundamentals other existing idle capacity and restart costs 

in 2013 exit costs related to the shutdown actions included 114 for the layoff of approximately 550 employees primary metals segment including 83 in pension costs accelerated depreciation of 58 baie comeau and asset impairments of 18 fusina and massena east representing the writeoff of the remaining book value of all related properties plants and equipment and 55 in other exit costs additionally in 2013 remaining inventories mostly operating supplies and raw materials were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 9 6 aftertax which was recorded in cogs the other exit costs of 55 represent 48 in asset retirement obligations and 5 in environmental remediation both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 2 in other related costs 

as of december 31 2015 the separations associated with 2013 restructuring programs were essentially complete in 2015 2014 and 2013 cash payments of 7 39 and 33 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to 2013 restructuring programs 

alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense —interest expense was 498 in 2015 compared with 473 in 2014 the increase of 25 or 5 was primarily due to an 8 higher average debt level somewhat offset by the absence of fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the thenplanned acquisition of firth rixson 13—see engineered products and solutions in segment information below the higher average debt level was mostly attributable to higher outstanding longterm debt due to the september 2014 issuance of 1250 in 5125 notes the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the purchase price of the firth rixson acquisition 

interest expense was 473 in 2014 compared with 453 in 2013 the increase of 20 or 4 was principally caused by lower capitalized interest 43 largely due to the progress completed at the aluminum complex in saudi arabia and fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the thenplanned acquisition of firth rixson 13—see engineered products and solutions in segment information below these items were partially offset by a 3 lower average debt level and lower amortization of debtrelated costs 

  

due to the conversion of convertible notes the lower average debt level was mostly attributable to lower outstanding longterm debt due to the march 2014 conversion of 575 in 525 convertible notes and the june 2013 repayment of 422 in 600 notes partially offset by the september 2014 issuance of 1250 in 5125 notes 

other expenses income net —other expenses net was 2 in 2015 compared with 47 in 2014 the decrease of 45 was mainly the result of a gain on the sale of land both around the lake charles la anode facility and at alcoa’s former sherwin tx refinery site 49 and the remaining equity investment in a china rolling mill 19 and a favorable change in deferred compensation these items were somewhat offset by the absence of a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname 28 and a portion of an equity investment in a china rolling mill 14 an unfavorable change in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance and a net unfavorable change in marktomarket derivative contracts 

other expenses net was 47 in 2014 compared with other income net of 25 in 2013 the change of 72 was mostly due to an unfavorable change in marktomarket derivative aluminum contracts 42 net unfavorable foreign currency movements 34 a higher equity loss related to alcoa’s share of the joint venture in saudi arabia due to startup costs of the entire complex including restart costs for one of the smelter potlines that was previously shut down due to a period of instability and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance these items were somewhat offset by a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname 28 and a portion of an equity investment in a china rolling mill 14 

income taxes —alcoa’s effective tax rate was 1794 provision on income in 2015 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to a 190 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in the united states and iceland see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below a 201 charge for legal matters in italy see restructuring and other charges above and a 25 impairment of goodwill see impairment of goodwill above that are nondeductible for income tax purposes a loss on the sale of a rolling mill in russia see global rolled products in segment information below for which no tax benefit was recognized a 34 net discrete income tax charge as described below and restructuring charges related to the curtailment of a refinery in suriname see restructuring and other charges above a portion for which no tax benefit was recognized 

in 2015 alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac a joint venture owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited alcoa consolidates awac for financial reporting purposes recognized an 85 discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets in suriname see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards alcoa also had a 51 deferred tax liability related to its 60share of these deferred tax assets that was written off as a result of the valuation allowance recognized by awac 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 644 provision on income in 2014 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate mainly due to restructuring charges related to operations in italy no tax benefit and australia benefit at a lower tax rate see restructuring and other charges above a 52 31 after noncontrolling interest discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in brazil see below a loss on the sale of three rolling mills in europe no tax benefit see global rolled products in segment information below and a 27 16 after noncontrolling interest discrete income tax charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in spain due to a november 2014 enacted tax rate change from 30 in 2014 to 28 in 2015 to 25 in 2016 these items were somewhat offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a 9 discrete income tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance related to operations in germany due to the initiation of a tax planning strategy 

in december 2011 one of alcoa’s subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations during 2013 the application was amended and refiled and separately a similar application was filed for another one of the company’s subsidiaries in brazil the deadline for the brazilian government to deny the application was july 11 2014 since alcoa did not receive notice that its applications were denied the tax holiday took effect automatically on july 12 2014 as a result the tax rate applicable to qualified holiday income for these 

  

subsidiaries decreased significantly from 34 to 1525 resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10year holiday period retroactively effective as of january 1 2013 additionally a portion of one of the subsidiaries net deferred tax asset that reverses within the holiday period was remeasured at the new tax rate the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary was not remeasured since it could still be utilized against the subsidiary’s future earnings not subject to the tax holiday this remeasurement resulted in a decrease to that subsidiary’s net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of 52 31 after noncontrolling interest 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 236 in 2013 provision on a loss compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs by 586 points from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a 1731 impairment of goodwill see impairment of goodwill above and a 209 charge for a legal matter see restructuring and other charges above that are nondeductible for income tax purposes a 372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the united states see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below restructuring charges related to operations in canada benefit at a lower tax rate and italy no tax benefit see restructuring and other charges above and a 9 discrete income tax charge related to prior year taxes in spain and australia these items were slightly offset by an 18 discrete income tax benefit related to new us tax legislation see below 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions through 2013 two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted alcoa are the lookthrough rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit the expiration of these two provisions resulted in alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of 18 in 2012 as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment alcoa recognized an 18 discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions beginning on january 1 2014 these two provisions once again expired on december 19 2014 the tax increase prevention act of 2014 was signed into law which retroactively extended for one year ie calendar year 2014 a number of the tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013 including the two specific aforementioned provisions beginning on january 1 2015 these two provisions once again expired on december 18 2015 the consolidated appropriations act 2016 was signed into law which retroactively as of january 1 2015 extended for two or five years or made permanent a number of the tax provisions that expired at the end of 2014 including the two specific aforementioned provisions the lookthrough rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations was renewed for five years through 2019 and the research and experimentation credit was made permanent 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2016 will be between 30 and 35 however business portfolio actions changes in the current economic environment tax legislation or rate changes currency fluctuations ability to realize deferred tax assets and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 

noncontrolling interests— net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 125 in 2015 compared with net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 91 in 2014 and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 41 in 2013 these amounts were virtually all related to alumina limited’s 40 ownership interest in awac in 2015 awac generated income compared to a loss in both 2014 and 2013 

in 2015 the change in awac’s results was principally due to improved operating results the absence of restructuring and other charges related to both the permanent shutdown of the point henry smelter in australia see restructuring and other charges above and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica see alumina in segment information below and the absence of a combined 79 32 was noncontrolling interest’s share discrete income tax charge related to a respective tax rate change in both brazil and spain see income taxes above these positive impacts were somewhat offset by restructuring charges related to the curtailment of both the refinery in suriname and in point comfort tx and the permanent closure of the anglesea power station and coal mine see restructuring and other charges above an 85 34 was noncontrolling interest’s share discrete income tax charge for a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets see income taxes above and the absence of a 28 gain 11 was noncontrolling interest’s share on the sale of a mining interest in suriname the improvement in 

  

awac’s operating results was largely attributable to net favorable foreign currency movements net productivity improvements and lower input costs slightly offset by a lower average realized alumina price see alumina in segment information below 

in 2014 awac generated a smaller loss compared to 2013 mainly driven by the absence of a 384 charge for a legal matter see below improved operating results and a 28 gain 11 was noncontrolling interest’s share on the sale of a mining interest in suriname these positive impacts were mostly offset by restructuring and other charges associated with both the permanent shutdown of the point henry smelter in australia see restructuring and other charges above and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica see alumina in segment information below and a combined 79 32 was noncontrolling interest’s share discrete income tax charge related to a respective tax rate change in both brazil and spain see income taxes above the improvement in awac’s operating results was principally due to net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements partially offset by an increase in input costs see alumina in segment information below even though awac generated an overall loss in both 2014 and 2013 the noncontrolling interest’s share resulted in income in 2013 due to the manner in which the charges and costs related to a legal matter were allocated a description of how these charges and costs for this legal matter impacted noncontrolling interests follows 

the noncontrolling interest’s share of awac’s charge for a legal matter in 2013 and 2012 was 58 related to the aforementioned 384 and 34 an 85 charge related to the civil portion of the same legal matter respectively in 2012 the 34 was based on the 40 ownership interest of alumina limited while in 2013 the 58 was based on 15 the application of a different percentage was due to the criteria in a 2012 allocation agreement between alcoa and alumina limited related to this legal matter being met additionally the 34 charge as well as costs related to this legal matter was retroactively adjusted to reflect the terms of the allocation agreement resulting in a credit to noncontrolling interests of 41 in 2013 in summary noncontrolling interests included a charge of 17 and 34 related to this legal matter in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

segment information 

alcoa’s operations consist of five worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals global rolled products engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutions see below segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting metal price lag see below interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges and other items including intersegment profit eliminations differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 

effective in the second quarter of 2015 management removed the impact of metal price lag from the results of the global rolled products and engineered products and solutions now engineered products and solutions and transportation and construction solutions—see below segments in order to enhance the visibility of the underlying operating performance of these businesses metal price lag describes the timing difference created when the average price of metal sold differs from the average cost of the metal when purchased by the respective segment in general when the price of metal increases metal price lag is favorable and when the price of metal decreases metal price lag is unfavorable the impact of metal price lag is now reported as a separate line item in alcoa’s reconciliation of total segment atoi to consolidated net loss income attributable to alcoa as a result this change does not impact the consolidated results of alcoa segment information for all prior periods presented was updated to reflect this change 

in the third quarter of 2015 management approved a realignment of alcoa’s engineered products and solutions segment due to the expansion of this part of alcoa’s business portfolio through both organic and inorganic growth this realignment consisted of moving both the alcoa wheel and transportation products and building and construction systems business units to a new reportable segment named transportation and construction solutions 

  

additionally the latin american soft alloy extrusions business previously included in corporate was moved into the new transportation and construction solutions segment the remaining engineered products and solutions segment consists of the alcoa fastening systems and rings renamed to include portions of the firth rixson business acquired in november 2014 alcoa power and propulsion includes the tital business acquired in march 2015 alcoa forgings and extrusions includes the other portions of firth rixson and alcoa titanium and engineered products a new business unit that consists solely of the rti international metals business acquired in july 2015 business units segment information for all prior periods presented was updated to reflect the new segment structure 

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 1906 in 2015 1968 in 2014 and 1267 in 2013 the following information provides shipments sales and atoi data for each reportable segment as well as certain production realized price and average cost data for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2015 see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

alumina 

 

  this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide refining system alumina mines bauxite from which alumina is produced and then sold directly to external smelter customers as well as to the primary metals segment see primary metals below or to customers who process it into industrial chemical products more than half of alumina’s production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment alumina produced by this segment and used internally is transferred to the primary metals segment at prevailing market prices a portion of this segment’s thirdparty sales are completed through the use of agents alumina traders and distributors generally the sales of this segment are transacted in us dollars while costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are the australian dollar the brazilian real the us dollar and the euro 

awac is an unincorporated global joint venture between alcoa and alumina limited and consists of a number of affiliated operating entities which own or have an interest in or operate the bauxite mines and alumina refineries within the alumina segment except for the poços de caldas refinery in brazil and a portion of the são luĺs refinery in brazil alcoa owns 60 and alumina limited owns 40 of these individual entities which are consolidated by the company for financial reporting purposes as such the results and analysis presented for the alumina segment are inclusive of alumina limited’s 40 interest 

in december 2014 awac completed the sale of its ownership stake in jamalco a bauxite mine and alumina refinery joint venture in jamaica to noble group ltd jamalco was 55 owned by a subsidiary of awac and while owned by awac 55 of both the operating results and assets and liabilities of this joint venture were included in the alumina segment as it relates to awac’s previous 55 ownership stake the refinery awac’s share of the capacity was 779 kmtperyear generated sales thirdparty and intersegment of approximately 200 in 2013 and the refinery and mine combined at the time of divestiture had approximately 500 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

  

in 2015 alumina production decreased by 886 kmt compared to 2014 the decline was mostly the result of the absence of production at the jamalco refinery see above and lower production at the suralco suriname—see below and poços de caldas brazil—see below refineries slightly offset by higher production at the san ciprian spain and point comfort texas refineries 

in march 2015 management initiated a 12month review of 2800 kmt in refining capacity for possible curtailment partial or full permanent closure or divestiture this review is part of management’s target to lower alcoa’s refining operations on the global alumina cost curve to the 21st percentile currently 23rd by the end of 2016 as part of this review in 2015 management decided to curtail all of the operating capacity at both the suralco 1330 kmtperyear and point comfort 2010 kmtperyear refineries the curtailment of the capacity at suralco was completed by the end of november 2015 management is currently in discussions with the suriname government to determine the best longterm solution for suralco due to limited bauxite reserves and the absence of a longterm energy alternative the curtailment of the capacity at point comfort is expected to be completed by the end of june 2016 375 kmtperyear was completed by the end of december 2015 suralco and point comfort have nameplate capacity of 2207 kmtperyear and 2305 kmtperyear respectively of which 877 kmt and 295 kmt respectively was curtailed prior to the review see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above for a description of the associated charges related to these actions 

in 2014 alumina production decreased by 12 kmt compared to 2013 the decline was mainly driven by lower production at the poços de caldas jamalco and san ciprian refineries mostly offset by higher production at every other refinery in the global system the poços de caldas refinery started to reduce production in early 2014 in response to management’s decision to fully curtail the poços de caldas smelter by the end of may 2014 see primary metals below as a result management reduced the alumina production at the poços de caldas refinery by approximately 200 kmtperyear by mid2014 this reduction was replaced by an increase in production at lower cost refineries within alcoa’s global system additionally the decrease at the refinery in jamaica was due to the absence of production for one month as a result of the sale of the ownership stake in jamalco see above 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment decreased 2 in 2015 compared with 2014 largely attributable to a 2 decline in average realized price somewhat offset by a 1 increase in volume the change in average realized price was mostly driven by a decrease in both the average alumina indexspot price and average lmebased price somewhat offset by a higher percentage 75 compared to 68 of smeltergrade alumina shipments linked to an alumina indexspot price instead of an lmebased price 

thirdparty sales for this segment improved 6 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily related to a 7 improvement in volume 

intersegment sales for the alumina segment declined 13 in both 2015 compared with 2014 and 2014 compared with 2013 the decrease in both periods was mostly the result of lower demand from the primary metals segment as a result of the closure curtailment or divestiture of a number of smelters see primary metals below and a lower average realized price 

atoi for the alumina segment increased 376 in 2015 compared with 2014 mainly caused by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar especially against the australian dollar and brazilian real net productivity improvements and lower input costs including natural gas fuel oil and transportation all of which were slightly offset by higher labor and maintenance costs these positive impacts were slightly offset by the previously mentioned lower average realized price and the absence of a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname 18 

atoi for this segment improved 111 in 2014 compared with 2013 mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar especially against the australian dollar net productivity improvements and a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname 18 these positive impacts were partially offset by higher input costs including natural gas particularly higher prices in australia bauxite mainly due to a new mining site in suriname and labor and maintenance all of which were somewhat offset by lower costs for caustic and a higher equity loss due to startup costs of the bauxite mine and refinery in saudi arabia 

  

in 2016 alumina production will be approximately 2500 kmt lower mostly due to the curtailment of the point comfort and suralco refineries also the continued shift towards alumina index and spot pricing is expected to average 85 of thirdparty smeltergrade alumina shipments additionally net productivity improvements are anticipated 

primary metals 

 

   

 this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide smelting system primary metals purchases alumina mostly from the alumina segment see alumina above from which primary aluminum is produced and then sold directly to external customers and traders as well as to alcoa’s midstream operations and to a lesser extent downstream operations results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess energy are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buyresell activity primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents approximately 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales buyresell activity occurs when this segment purchases metal and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream operations in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements generally the sales of this segment are transacted in us dollars while costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations which are the us dollar the euro the norwegian kroner icelandic krona the canadian dollar the brazilian real and the australian dollar 

in november 2014 alcoa completed the sale of an aluminum rod plant located in bécancour québec canada to sural laminated products this facility takes molten aluminum and shapes it into the form of a rod which is used by customers primarily for the transportation of electricity while owned by alcoa the operating results and assets and liabilities of this plant were included in the primary metals segment in conjunction with this transaction alcoa entered into a multiyear agreement with sural laminated products to supply molten aluminum for the rod plant the aluminum rod plant generated sales of approximately 200 in 2013 and at the time of divestiture had approximately 60 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

in december 2014 alcoa completed the sale of its 5033 ownership stake in the mt holly smelter located in goose creek south carolina to century aluminum company while owned by alcoa 5033 of both the operating results and assets and liabilities related to the smelter were included in the primary metals segment as it relates to alcoa’s previous 5033 ownership stake the smelter alcoa’s share of the capacity was 115 kmtperyear generated sales of approximately 280 in 2013 and at the time of divestiture had approximately 250 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

at december 31 2015 alcoa had 778 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 3401 kmt in 2015 idle capacity increased 113 kmt compared to 2014 mostly due to the curtailment of 217 kmt combined at a smelter in each the 

  

united states and brazil partially offset by the permanent closure of the poços de caldas smelter in brazil 96 kmtperyear base capacity declined 96 kmt between december 31 2015 and 2014 due to the previously mentioned permanent closure of the poços de caldas smelter a detailed description of each of these actions follows below 

at december 31 2014 alcoa had 665 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 3497 kmt in 2014 idle capacity increased 10 kmt compared to 2013 due to the curtailment of 159 kmt combined at two smelters in brazil mostly offset by the permanent closure of the portovesme smelter in italy 150 kmtperyear base capacity declined 540 kmt between december 31 2014 and 2013 due to the permanent closure of both a smelter in australia and two remaining potlines at a smelter in the united states 274 kmt combined the previously mentioned permanent closure of the portovesme smelter and the sale of alcoa’s ownership stake in the mt holly smelter see above a detailed description of each of these actions follows below 

in march 2015 management initiated a 12month review of 500 kmt in smelting capacity for possible curtailment partial or full permanent closure or divestiture this review is part of management’s target to lower alcoa’s smelting operations on the global aluminum cost curve to the 38th percentile currently 43rd by 2016 in summary under this review management approved the curtailment of 447 kmtperyear and the closure of 269 kmtperyear the following is a description of each action 

also in march 2015 management decided to curtail the remaining capacity 74 kmtperyear at the são luís smelter in brazil this action was completed in april 2015 in 2013 and 2014 combined alcoa curtailed capacity of 194 kmtperyear at the são luís smelter under a prior management review see below 

additionally in november 2015 management decided to curtail the remaining capacity at the intalco 230 kmtperyear and wenatchee 143 kmtperyear smelters both in washington these two smelters previously had curtailed capacity of 90 kmtperyear combined the curtailment of the remaining capacity at wenatchee was completed by the end of december 2015 and the curtailment of the remaining capacity at intalco is expected to be completed by the end of june 2016 

furthermore in december 2015 management approved the permanent closure of the warrick in smelter 269 kmtperyear this decision was made as this smelter is no longer competitive in light of prevailing market conditions for the price of aluminum the shutdown of the warrick smelter is expected to be completed by the end of march 2016 

separate from the 2015 smelting capacity review described above in june 2015 management approved the permanent closure of the poços de caldas smelter effective immediately the poços de caldas smelter had been temporarily idle since may 2014 see below due to challenging global market conditions for primary aluminum and higher operating costs which made the smelter uncompetitive the decision to permanently close the poços de caldas smelter was based on the fact that these underlying conditions had not improved 

in may 2013 management initiated a 15month review of 460 kmt in smelting capacity for possible curtailment this review was aimed at maintaining alcoa’s competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and focused on the highestcost smelting capacity and those plants that have longterm risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty in 2014 an additional 250 kmt of smelting capacity was included in the review in summary under this review management approved the closure of 146 kmtperyear and 274 kmtperyear and the curtailment of 131 kmtperyear and 159 kmtperyear in 2013 and 2014 respectively the following is a description of each action 

also in may 2013 management approved the permanent closure of two potlines 105 kmtperyear that utilize soderberg technology at the baie comeau smelter in quebec canada additionally in august 2013 management approved the permanent closure of one potline 41 kmtperyear that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east ny smelter the shutdown of these three lines was completed by the end of september 2013 the baie comeau smelter has a remaining capacity of 280 kmtperyear composed of two prebake potlines and the massena east smelter had a remaining capacity of 84 kmtperyear composed of two soderberg potlines see below 

  

additionally in august 2013 management decided to curtail 97 kmtperyear at the são luís smelter and 31 kmtperyear at the poços de caldas smelter this action was also completed by the end of september 2013 an additional 3 kmtperyear was curtailed at the poços de caldas smelter by the end of 2013 

in january 2014 management approved the permanent closure of the remaining capacity 84 kmtperyear at the massena east smelter which represented two soderberg potlines that were no longer competitive this shutdown was completed by the end of march 2014 in february 2014 management approved the permanent closure of the point henry smelter 190 kmtperyear in australia this decision was made as management determined that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable the shutdown of the point henry smelter was completed in august 2014 

also in march 2014 management decided to curtail the remaining capacity 62 kmtperyear at the poços de caldas smelter and additional capacity 85 kmtperyear at the são luís smelter the curtailment of this capacity was completed by the end of may 2014 an additional 12 kmtperyear was curtailed at the são luís smelter during the remainder of 2014 

separate from the 20132014 smelting capacity review described above in june 2013 management approved the permanent closure of the fusina smelter 44 kmtperyear in italy as the underlying conditions that led to the idling of the smelter in 2010 had not fundamentally changed including low aluminum prices and the lack of an economically viable longterm power solution in august 2014 management approved the permanent closure of the portovesme smelter which had been idle since november 2012 this decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged including the lack of a viable longterm power solution 

see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above for a description of the associated charges related to all of the above actions in 2015 2014 and 2013 

in 2015 aluminum production declined by 314 kmt mainly the result of the absence of andor lower production at the combined four smelters point henry são luís massena east and poços de caldas impacted by the 2014 and 2015 capacity reviews and at the smelter divested in 2014 mt holly all of which is described above 

in 2014 aluminum production decreased by 425 kmt mostly due to lower production at the five smelters são luís massena east point henry baie comeau and poços de caldas impacted by the 20132014 capacity review described above 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment declined 18 in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to a 14 drop in average realized price the absence of sales approximately 585 from five smelters and a rod mill that were closed curtailed or divested in 2014 and lower energy sales in brazil due to both a decrease in energy prices and a weaker brazilian real these negative impacts were slightly offset by higher volume in the remaining smelter portfolio and higher buyresell activity the change in average realized price was largely attributable to a 10 lower average lme price on 15day lag and lower regional premiums which dropped by an average of 39 in the united states and canada and 44 in europe the higher buyresell activity was primarily related to the fulfillment of customer orders with aluminum purchased from the smelter at the saudi arabia joint venture 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment increased 3 in 2014 compared with 2013 mainly due to higher energy sales in brazil resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity higher buyresell activity and a 7 increase in average realized price mostly offset by lower volumes including from the five smelters impacted by the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions the change in average realized price was driven by higher regional premiums which increased by an average of 84 in the united states and canada and 56 in europe 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment declined 26 in 2015 compared with 2014 mainly the result of lower demand from the midstream and downstream businesses and a decrease in average realized price the decline related to the midstream business was driven by the absence of shipments to four of the five rolling mills the fifth mill 

  

purchased scrap metal from thirdparties that were either divested or permanently closed in december 2014 see global rolled products below intersegment sales for this segment improved 12 in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to an increase in average realized price driven by higher regional premiums and higher demand from the midstream and downstream businesses 

atoi for the primary metals segment decreased 439 in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily caused by both the previously mentioned lower average realized aluminum price and lower energy sales higher energy costs mostly in spain as the 2014 interruptibility rights were more favorable than the 2015 structure and an unfavorable impact related to the curtailment of the são luís smelter these negative impacts were somewhat offset by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar against most major currencies net productivity improvements the absence of a writeoff of inventory related to the permanent closure of the portovesme point henry and massena east smelters 44 and a lower equity loss related to the joint venture in saudi arabia including the absence of restart costs for one of the potlines that was previously shut down due to a period of instability 

atoi for this segment climbed 614 in 2014 compared with 2013 principally related to a higher average realized aluminum price the previously mentioned energy sales in brazil net productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar against all major currencies lower costs for carbon and alumina and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in australia these positive impacts were slightly offset by an unfavorable impact associated with the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions described above including a writeoff of inventory related to the permanent closure of the portovesme point henry and massena east smelters 44 and higher energy costs particularly in spain labor and maintenance 

in 2016 aluminum production will be approximately 450 kmt lower and thirdparty sales will reflect the absence of approximately 400 both as a result of the 2015 curtailment and closure actions also energy sales in brazil will be negatively impacted by a decline in energy prices while net productivity improvements are anticipated

 the unfavorable change in noncurrent assets was mostly related to a 300 prepayment made under a natural gas supply agreement in australia see below

the components of the negative change in working capital were as follows 

 

  

  

  

   

  

 the higher pension contributions of 39 were principally driven by special termination benefits of 86 for employees affected by the 2013 shutdown of capacity at a smelter in canada 

on august 8 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law by the united states government hatfa in part provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 specifically hatfa modifies the interest rates that had been set in 2012 by the moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act this relief had an immediate impact on the calculation of the then remaining funding contributions in 2014 resulting in a reduction of 100 in minimum required pension funding

if no hedging relationship is designated the derivative is marked to market through earnings 

cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such 

  

uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record an aro for the removal treatment transportation storage andor disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks polychlorinated biphenyls various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2015 ranges from less than 1 to 46 per structure 156 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has ten reporting units of which four are included in the engineered products and solutions segment and three are included in the transportation and construction solutions segment the remaining three reporting units are the alumina segment the primary metals segment all goodwill was impaired in 2013—see below and the global rolled products segment more than 70 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems and rings afsr 2232 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1695 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment these amounts include an allocation of corporate’s goodwill 

in november 2014 alcoa acquired firth rixson see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations above and as a result recognized 1801 in goodwill this amount was allocated between the afsr and alcoa forgings and extrusion reporting units which is part of the engineered products and solutions segment in march and july 2015 alcoa acquired tital and rti respectively see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations above and recognized 118 and 240 respectively in goodwill the goodwill amount related to tital was allocated to the app reporting unit and the amount related to rti was allocated to alcoa titanium and engineered products a new alcoa reporting unit that consists solely of the acquired rti business and is part of the engineered products and solutions segment 

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the existing twostep quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test 

alcoa’s policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test generally management will proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for two to three reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill this policy will result in each of the nine reporting units with goodwill being subjected to the twostep quantitative impairment test at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the 

  

type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2015 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for seven reporting units the alumina segment the four reporting units in the engineered products and solutions segment including afsr and app and two reporting units in the transportation and construction solutions segment management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the seven reporting units were less than their carrying values as such no further analysis was required 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices production costs tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

during the 2015 annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for two reporting units as follows global rolled products segment and the soft alloys extrusion business in brazil hereafter “sae” which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment the estimated fair value of the global rolled products segment was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value resulting in no impairment for sae the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value as a result management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of the sae reporting unit’s goodwill the results of the secondstep analysis showed that the implied fair value of the goodwill was zero therefore in the fourth quarter of 2015 alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of 25 the impairment of the sae goodwill resulted from headwinds from the recent downturn in the brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies as a result of the goodwill impairment there is no goodwill remaining for the sae reporting unit 

goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units except for the primary metals segment in 2013 see below and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test 

in 2013 for primary metals the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value as a result management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of primary metals’ goodwill the results of the secondstep analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero therefore in the fourth quarter of 2013 alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of 1731 1719 after noncontrolling interest as a result of the goodwill impairment there is no goodwill remaining for the primary metals reporting unit 

  

the impairment of primary metals’ goodwill resulted from several causes the prolonged economic downturn a disconnect between industry fundamentals and pricing that has resulted in lower metal prices and the increased cost of alumina a key raw material resulting from expansion of the alumina price index throughout the industry all of these factors exacerbated by increases in discount rates continue to place significant downward pressure on metal prices and operating margins and the resulting estimated fair value of the primary metals business as a result management decreased the nearterm and longterm estimates of the operating results and cash flows utilized in assessing primary metals’ goodwill for impairment the valuation of goodwill for the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is considered a level 3 fair value measurement which means that the valuation of the assets and liabilities reflect management’s own judgments regarding the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortia which are accounted for on the equity method the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking consumer products transportation insurance and pharmaceutical among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model 

  

exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2015 2014 and 2013 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 429 400 and 480 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 430 and either a charge or credit of approximately 15 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

in conjunction with the annual measurement of the funded status of alcoa’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans at december 31 2015 management elected to change the manner in which the interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost will be determined in 2016 and beyond previously the interest cost component was determined by multiplying the single equivalent rate described above and the aggregate discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations under the new methodology the interest cost component will be determined by aggregating the product of the discounted cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for each year and an individual spot rate referred to as the “spot rate” approach this change will result in a lower interest cost component of net periodic benefit cost under the new methodology compared to the previous methodology of approximately 100 65 aftertax in 2016 management believes this new methodology which represents a change in an accounting estimate is a better measure of the interest cost as each year’s cash flows are specifically linked to the interest rates of bond payments in the same respective year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fouryear average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on the annual 10year moving and 20year moving averages when developing this assumption management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2015 2014 and 2013 management used 775 800 and 850 as its expected longterm rate of return which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class these rates fell within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class in 2015 the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return was due to a decrease in the 20year moving average of actual performance for 2016 management anticipates that 775 will be the expected longterm rate of return 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 20 for 2015 

during 2014 an independent us organization that publishes standard mortality rates based on statistical analysis and studies issued updated mortality tables the rates within these standard tables are used by actuaries as one of the many assumptions when measuring a company’s projected benefit obligation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans the funded status of all of alcoa’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of december 31 each calendar year during the measurement process at the end of 2014 alcoa with the assistance of an external actuary considered the rates in the new mortality tables along with specific data related to alcoa’s retiree population to develop the mortalityrelated assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation of various us benefit plans as a result alcoa recognized a charge of approximately 100 65 aftertax in other comprehensive loss related to the updated mortality assumptions 

in 2015 a net charge of 10 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the unfavorable performance of the plan assets which was mostly offset by the amortization of actuarial losses and a 30 basis point increase in the discount rate in 2014 a net charge of 69 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to an 80 basis point decrease in the discount rate and a change in the mortality assumption see above which was mostly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses in 2013 a net benefit of 531 aftertax and noncontrolling interest was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 65 basis point increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses 

  

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2015 2014 and 2013 was 92 61 aftertax 87 58 aftertax and 71 48 aftertax respectively of these amounts 17 15 and 14 in 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not greater than 50 that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and alcoa’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

in 2013 alcoa recognized a 372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the united states of this amount a 237 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets related to a spanish consolidated tax group these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 for certain credits to an unlimited life for operating losses after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the tax benefit of these deferred tax assets this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business 2013 realized prices were the lowest since 2009 combined with prior year cumulative losses of the spanish consolidated tax group during 2014 the underlying value of the deferred tax assets decreased due to a remeasurement as a result of the enactment of new tax rates in spain beginning in 2015 see income taxes in earnings summary under results of operations above the sale of a member of the spanish consolidated tax group and a change in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the valuation allowance decreased by the same amount at december 31 2015 the amount of the valuation allowance was 149 this valuation allowance was reevaluated as of december 31 2015 and no change to the allowance was deemed necessary based on all available evidence the need 

  

for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result a portion or all of the allowance may be reversed based on changes in facts and circumstances 

the remaining 135 recognized in 2013 relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of available foreign tax credits in the united states these credits can be carried forward for 10 years and have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2023 as of december 31 2013 2016 to 2025 as of december 31 2015 after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the full tax benefit of these foreign tax credits this was primarily due to lower foreign sourced taxable income after consideration of tax planning strategies and after the inclusion of earnings from foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends this valuation allowance was reevaluated as of december 31 2015 and due to reductions in foreign sourced taxable income a 134 discrete income tax charge was recognized additionally 15 of foreign tax credits expired at the end of 2015 resulting in a corresponding decrease to the valuation allowance at december 31 2015 the amount of the valuation allowance was 254 the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result an increase or decrease to this allowance may result based on changes in facts and circumstances 

in 2015 alcoa recognized an additional 141 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in iceland and suriname of this amount an 85 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets in suriname which were related mostly to employee benefits and tax loss carryforwards these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2022 the remaining 56 charge relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of the deferred tax assets recorded in iceland these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2017 to 2023 after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the tax benefit of either of these deferred tax assets this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business combined with prior year cumulative losses and a short expiration period the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result a portion or all of the allowance may be reversed based on changes in facts and circumstances 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust and is produced primarily from bauxite an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide commonly referred to as alumina aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina the company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the awac enterprise located in the countries listed in the table below as well as pursuant to both longterm and shortterm contracts and mining leases during 2014 alcoa consumed 408 million metric tons mt from awac and its own resources and 82 million mt from entities in which the company has an equity interest in addition awac sold 16 million mt of bauxite to third parties tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons bdmt unless otherwise stated see the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this section 

the company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from the date of this report for purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as 

  

feedstock to its refineries the company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves bauxite resources represent deposits for which tonnage densities shape physical characteristics grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits and include diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining metallurgical economic marketing legal environmental social and governmental factors alcoa employs a conventional approach including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing alcoa to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves 

the table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the company while the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for the company’s mining locations given the company’s extensive bauxite resources the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the company’s rights to bauxite it is not costeffective to invest the significant resources necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the company rather bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future 

bauxite resource development guidelines 

alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with alcoa’s internal guidelines as administered by the alcoa ore reserves committee aorc the reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions alcoa does not use a price for bauxite alumina or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves the primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery in addition to these specifications a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material alcoa mining locations have annual infill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve and resource classification of their bauxite

the major raw materials purchased in 2014 for each of the company’s reportable segments are listed below 

 

   

generally other materials are purchased from thirdparty suppliers under competitively priced supply contracts or bidding arrangements the company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available 

for each metric ton of alumina produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

 for each metric ton of aluminum produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

 explanatory note certain aluminum produced by alcoa also includes alloying materials because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce alcoa’s various alloys providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful with the exception of a very small number of internally used products alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to an aluminum association standard the aluminum association of which alcoa is an active member uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types in general each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also have other constituents as well but of lesser amounts 

energy 

employing the bayer process alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power energy accounts for approximately 21 of the company’s total alumina refining production costs electric power accounts for approximately 26 of the company’s primary aluminum production costs alcoa generates approximately 25 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters and refineries 

north america – electricity 

the deschambault baie comeau and bécancour smelters in québec purchased electricity under existing contracts that expired on december 31 2014 these were replaced by new longterm contracts with hydroquébec executed in october 2014 deschambault and baie comeau smelters and december 2014 bécancour smelter both of which will expire on december 31 2029 upon expiration alcoa will have the option of extending the term of the new baie 

  

comeau contract to february 23 2036 the smelter located in baie comeau québec purchases approximately 74 of its power needs under the hydroquébec contract and the remainder from a 40 owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power limited partnership 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 35 of the power requirements for alcoa’s smelters operating in the us the company purchases power under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates the yadkin hydroelectric project consisting of four dams in north carolina and the warrick coalfired power plant located in indiana 

for several years apgi has been pursuing a new longterm license for the yadkin hydroelectric project from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in 2007 apgi filed with ferc a relicensing settlement agreement signed by a majority of interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues the national environmental policy act process is complete with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in april 2008 the remaining requirement for relicensing was the issuance by north carolina of the required water quality certification under section 401 of the clean water act north carolina’s department of environment and natural resources denr issued a section 401 water quality certification on may 7 2009 but it was appealed and then stayed in september 2012 apgi filed a new application for a 401 certificate seeking a fresh review of its application however on august 2 2013 the state of north carolina filed suit in state court seeking a declaratory ruling that it not apgi owns the yadkin riverbed beneath the hydroelectric project as well as a portion of the project dams upon the filing of the lawsuit the denr denied apgi’s 401 certificate asserting that it cannot review the application given the dispute over ownership of the lands and the project apgi has appealed that denial in the administrative court of north carolina and has also informed ferc of the appeal a necessary step to demonstrate that the relicensing proceeding remains pending before ferc apgi removed the riverbed lawsuit to federal court in 2013 on november 20 2014 the court denied apgi’s motion for summary judgment and partially granted and partially denied north carolina’s motion for partial summary judgment a pretrial conference was held on february 2 2015 the court has ordered trial to commence on april 21 2015 

pending completion of the relicensing process apgi received yeartoyear license renewals from ferc starting in may 2008 and will continue to operate under annual licenses until a new section 401 certification is issued and the ferc relicensing process is complete since the permanent closure of the badin north carolina smelter power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing llc and then the wholesale market 

apgi generates substantially all of the power used at the company’s warrick indiana smelter using nearby coal reserves since may 2005 alcoa has owned the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves with the friendsville mine being operated by vigo coal company inc the friendsville mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year in june 2011 the red brush west mine owned by alcoa and operated by vigo coal was opened and produced approximately 60000 tons per month over an eighteenmonth period but operation ceased in 2013 in the second quarter of 2013 liberty mine also owned by alcoa and operated by vigo coal began producing coal and is operating at a level of approximately one million tons per year friendsville and liberty mines together combine to supply 95 of the power plant’s future needs the balance of the coal used is royalty coal or purchased coal from the illinois basin

europe – electricity 

alcoa’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that commenced on january 1 2013 the contracts for san ciprián and avilés smelters each have a fouryear term expiring december 31 2016 the contract for the la coruña smelter which expired on december 31 2014 has been extended for an additional year expiring december 31 2015 

prior to the establishment of power supply under the bilateral contracts alcoa was supplied under a regulated power tariff on january 25 2007 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with european union eu state aid rules alcoa operated in spain for more than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation was limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system on february 4 2014 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the electricity tariffs granted by spain for year 2005 do not constitute unlawful state aid due to the high cost position of the la coruña and avilés smelters combined with rising raw material costs and falling aluminum prices in early january 2012 alcoa announced its intentions to partially and temporarily curtail its la coruña and avilés spain smelters the partial curtailments were completed in the first half of 2012 as a result of a modification to the load interruptibility regime currently in place in the spanish power market in the first quarter of 2013 alcoa restarted a portion 25000 mpty combined for avilés and la coruña of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime see the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section for more information 

a competitive bidding mechanism to allocate interruptibility rights in spain was settled during 2014 to be applied starting from january 1 2015 the first auction process to allocate rights took place in november 2014 where alcoa secured 275mw of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the san ciprián smelter a second auction process took place in december 2014 where alcoa secured an additional 100mw of interruptibility rights for the 2015 period for the san ciprián smelter 20x5mw 120mw for the la coruña smelter 24x5mw and 110mw for the avilés smelter 22x5mw 

alcoa owns two smelters in norway lista and mosjøen which have longterm power arrangements in place that continue until the end of 2019 

  

iceland – electricity 

alcoa’s fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland began operation in 2007 central to those operations is a fortyyear power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company built the kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter in late 2009 iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries both for a period of three years from 2010 through 2012 one tax is based on energy consumption the other is a prepayment of certain other charges and will be recoverable starting in 2018 in 2012 iceland extended the energy consumption tax though 2015 

spain – natural gas 

in order to facilitate the full conversion of the san ciprian spain alumina refinery from fuel oil to natural gas in october 2013 alumina española sa ae and gas natural transporte sdg sl gn signed a take or pay gas pipeline utilization agreement pursuant to that agreement the ultimate shareholders of ae alcoa inc and alumina limited have agreed to guarantee the payment of ae’s contracted gas pipeline utilization over the four years of the commitment period in the event ae fails to do so each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share ie 6040 such commitment will come into force six months after the gas pipeline is put into operation by gn the gas pipeline was completed in january 2015 and the refinery has switched to natural gas consumption for 100 of its needs 

three supply contracts were signed in 2014 for the supply of natural gas to the san ciprián spain alumina refinery during 2015 period with endesa union fenosa gas and bp expiring by april 2016 december 2015 and december 2015 respectively pursuant to those agreements alcoa inversiones españa sl and alumina limited have agreed to guarantee the payment of ae’s obligations under the endesa contract over the contract length each shareholder being responsible for its respective proportionate share ie 6040 in the same way aluminio español sa and alumina limited have agreed to guarantee the payment of ae’s obligations under the union fenosa gas and bp contract over those contracts’ respective lengths with each entity being responsible for its proportionate share ie 6040 

north america – natural gas 

in order to supply its refinery and smelters in the us and canada alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity and the interstate pipeline transportation are procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

australia – natural gas 

alcoa holds a 20 equity interest in the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline this interest was purchased in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia alcoa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries more than 90 of alcoa’s gas requirements for the remainder of the decade are secured under longterm contracts alcoa is considering multiple supply options to replace expiring contracts including investing directly in projects that have the potential to deliver costbased gas

 item 1a risk factors 

alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm its business financial condition or results of operations including causing alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to alcoa or that alcoa currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods 

the aluminum industry and aluminum enduse markets are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical and alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and aluminum enduse markets alcoa sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the commercial construction and transportation industries and the demand for its products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by its customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in the general us or worldwide economy currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond its control the demand for aluminum is highly correlated to economic growth for example the european sovereign debt crisis had an adverse effect on european supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum products the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for commodities including aluminum a sustained slowdown in china’s economic growth and aluminum demand that is not offset by increased aluminum demand in emerging economies such as india brazil and several south east asian countries or the combined slowdown of other markets could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices 

  

while alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum and aluminum products are positive the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength pace or sustainability of the global economic recovery and the effects of government intervention negative economic conditions such as another major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices including global regional and productspecific prices 

the overall price of primary aluminum consists of several components 1 the underlying base metal component which is typically based on quoted prices from the london metal exchange lme 2 the regional premium which comprises the incremental price over the base lme component that is associated with the physical delivery of metal to a particular region eg the midwest premium for metal sold in the united states and 3 the product premium which represents the incremental price for receiving physical metal in a particular shape eg coil billet slab rod etc or alloy each of the above three components has its own drivers of variability the lme price is typically driven by macroeconomic factors global supply and demand of aluminum including expectations for growth and contraction and the level of global inventories and financial investors regional premiums tend to vary based on the supply of and demand for metal in a particular region and associated transportation costs product premiums generally are a function of supply and demand for a given primary aluminum shape and alloy combination in a particular region speculative trading in aluminum and the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets have also increased in recent years contributing to higher levels of price volatility in 2014 the lme price of aluminum reached a high of 2089 per metric ton and a low of 1634 per metric ton high lme inventories or the release of substantial inventories into the market could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum declines in the lme price have had a negative impact on alcoa’s results of operations additionally alcoa’s results could be adversely affected by decreases in regional premiums that participants in the physical metal market pay for immediate delivery of aluminum although regional premiums have reached levels substantially higher than historical averages during 2013 and 2014 new lme warehousing rules see risk factor entitled “new lme warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease” or other factors may cause these premiums to decrease which would have a negative impact on the company’s results of operations a sustained weak lme aluminum pricing environment deterioration in lme aluminum prices or a decrease in regional premiums or product premiums could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations or cash flow 

new lme warehousing rules could cause aluminum prices to decrease 

in 2013 the lme announced new rules scheduled to take effect on april 1 2014 that would require lme warehouses under certain conditions to deliver out more aluminum than they take in although a court in the united kingdom ruled in march 2014 that the lme’s consultation process in developing the new rules had been unfair and unlawful in october 2014 a court of appeal in the united kingdom upheld the lme’s consultation process as being fair the new warehousing rules which took effect on february 1 2015 could cause an increase in the supply of aluminum to enter the physical market and may cause regional delivery premiums product premiums and lme aluminum prices to fall decreases in regional delivery and product premiums decreases in lme aluminum prices and increases in the supply of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations or cash flow 

alcoa may not be able to realize the expected benefits from its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its valueadd business and by creating a lower cost competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio 

alcoa is continuing to execute on its strategy of transforming its portfolio by growing its valueadd business to capture profitable growth as a lightweight metals innovation leader and by creating a lower cost competitive commodity business by optimizing its portfolio it is investing in its valueadd manufacturing and engineering businesses to capture growth opportunities in strong end markets like automotive and aerospace alcoa is also building out its valueadd businesses including by introducing innovative new products and technology solutions and investing in 

  

expansions of valueadd capacity alcoa’s growth projects include the joint venture with ma’aden in saudi arabia the automotive expansions in davenport iowa and alcoa tennessee the aluminum lithium capacity expansion in lafayette indiana at the alcoa technical center in pennsylvania and at the kitts green plant in the united kingdom and the expansion in aerospace capabilities in la porte indiana hampton virginia and davenport iowa from time to time alcoa also pursues growth opportunities that are strategically aligned with its objectives such as the acquisition of the firth rixson business completed in november 2014 and the announced acquisition of tital expected to close in the first quarter of 2015 in addition alcoa is optimizing its rolling mill portfolio as part of its strategy for profitable growth in the midstream business at the same time the company is creating a competitive commodity business by taking decisive actions to lower the cost base of its upstream operations closing selling or curtailing highcost global smelting capacity optimizing alumina refining capacity and pursuing the sale of its interest in certain other operations 

alcoa has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio although management believes that its strategic actions will be beneficial to alcoa there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized adverse factors may prevent alcoa from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines acquisitions present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company and unanticipated costs and liabilities and the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders in addition alcoa may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if the buyer fails to honor all commitments there can be no assurance that acquisitions and divestitures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to alcoa 

marketdriven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by nonmarket forces or other impediments to production closures 

in response to marketdriven factors relating to the global supply and demand of aluminum alcoa has curtailed portions of its aluminum production certain other aluminum producers have independently undertaken to make cuts in production as well however the existence of nonmarket forces on global aluminum industry capacity such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry selfsufficiency may prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers’ smelters irrespective of their position on the industry cost curve other production cuts may be impeded by longterm contracts to buy power or raw materials if industry overcapacity persists due to the disruption by such nonmarket forces on the marketdriven balancing of the global supply and demand of aluminum the resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect the operating results of aluminum producers including alcoa 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts certain conditions could negatively affect alcoa’s results of operations including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

 if events such as those listed above were to occur the resulting high energy costs or the disruption of an energy source or the requirement to repay all or a portion of the benefit alcoa received under a power supply interruptibility regime could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business and results of operations 

alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects of decreases in commodity or lmelinked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations alcoa may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results are affected by significant lag effects of declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in the lmelinked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period increases in the cost of raw materials or decreases in input costs that are disproportionate to concurrent sharper decreases in the price of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s operating results 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro and norwegian kroner may affect alcoa’s profitability as some important inputs are purchased in other currencies while the company’s upstream products are generally sold in us dollars in addition although a strong us dollar helps alcoa’s nearterm profitability over a longer term a strong us dollar may have an unfavorable impact to alcoa’s position on the global aluminum cost curve due to alcoa’s us smelting portfolio as the us dollar strengthens the cost curve shifts down for smelters outside the us but costs for alcoa’s us smelting portfolio may not decline 

alcoa may not be able to successfully realize goals established in each of its four business segments at the levels or by the dates targeted for such goals 

alcoa established targets for each of its four major business segments including the following 

 

  

  

  

   

for more information regarding alcoa’s targets see “management review of 2014 and outlook for the future” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report there can be no assurance that any of these targets or other goals will be completed as anticipated market conditions or other factors may prevent alcoa from accomplishing its goals at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on its business financial condition results of operations or the market price of its securities 

alcoa faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1 business—competitive conditions of this report the markets for alcoa’s aluminum and nonaluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets including some that are subsidized in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites ceramics and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets new product offerings or new technologies in the marketplace may compete with or replace alcoa products the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products and technological advancements or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s ability to leverage its innovation expertise across its businesses and key end markets and in the case of its upstream businesses having access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings could limit alcoa’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs increase the pricing of its credit facilities adversely affect the market price of its securities trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

standard and poor’s ratings services currently rates alcoa’s longterm debt bbb the lowest level of investment grade rating with a negative ratings outlook ratings and outlook were affirmed on april 23 2014 in may 2013 moody’s investors service downgraded alcoa’s longterm debt rating from baa3 to ba1 which is below investment grade and changed the outlook from rating under review to stable in april 2014 fitch ratings downgraded alcoa’s rating from bbb to bb a below investment grade rating and changed the outlook from negative to stable there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take further negative actions with respect to alcoa’s ratings increased debt levels adverse aluminum market or macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

as a result of the moody’s downgrade certain counterparties have required alcoa to post letters of credit or cash collateral and the cost of issuance of new public debt and commercial paper has increased for more information regarding the effects of the moody’s downgrade on the company’s liquidity see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources – financing activities” in this report the company does not believe that alcoa’s financing activities were significantly impacted by the fitch downgrade however any further downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could adversely impact the market price of alcoa’s securities adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by standard and poor’s or a further downgrade by moody’s would subject alcoa to higher costs under alcoa’s fiveyear revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from alcoa or otherwise impair alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations 

  

cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of alcoa’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt its business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operation 

alcoa faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

the company believes that it faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries it serves the locations of its operations and its technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of its information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on alcoa’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted while the company continually works to safeguard its systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use its systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt its operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact alcoa’s reputation and its competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and result in the diminution of the value of the company’s investment in research and development 

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future for example in december 2009 alcoa formed a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex including a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill in the kingdom of saudi arabia although the company has in connection with the saudi arabia joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

  

  

  

 there can be no assurance that alcoa’s joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

alcoa’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by limits in its capital expenditures 

alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in growth opportunities and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities for 2015 generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending continues to be an alcoa target insufficient cash generation or capital project overruns may negatively impact alcoa’s 

  

ability to fund as planned its sustaining and returnseeking capital projects over the long term alcoa’s ability to take advantage of improved aluminum or other market conditions or growth opportunities in its midstream and downstream businesses may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions which could adversely affect the longterm value of its business and the company’s position in relation to its competitors 

alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates if alcoa’s interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions its growth could be constrained any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

alcoa’s global operations expose the company to risks that could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the united states including brazil china europe guinea russia and the kingdom of saudi arabia the company’s global operations are subject to a number of risks including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 while the impact of any of the foregoing factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition operating results or cash flows existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events 

an adverse decline in the liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

alcoa’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense alcoa records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how alcoa’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note w to the 

  

consolidated financial statements—pension and other postretirement benefits in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities alcoa would contribute to the pension plans 

potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act “map21” enacted in 2012 provided temporary relief for employers like alcoa who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations on august 8 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law hatfa extended the relief provided by map21 and modified the interest rates that had been set by map21 alcoa believes that the relief provided by hatfa will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next several years however higher than expected pension contributions due to a decline in the plans’ funded status as a result of declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on the company’s cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans adversely affecting alcoa’s liquidity and results of operations 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect alcoa’s future profitability 

alcoa is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application including the possibility of retroactive effect could affect the company’s tax expense and profitability alcoa’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of tax audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns or related litigation and continuing assessments of its tax exposures corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions significant changes to the us corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact positive or negative on alcoa’s effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

a significant portion of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1 business of this report while alcoa was previously successful in renegotiating the master collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers the most recent renegotiation having taken place in june 2014 alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate that agreement or other collective bargaining agreements in the us and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

  

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments including advanced smelting process technologies such as inert anode and carbothermic technology alloy development engineered finishes and product design high speed continuous casting and rolling technology and other advanced manufacturing technologies for more information on alcoa’s research and development programs see “research and development” in part i item 1 business of this report there can be no assurance that such developments or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

alcoa’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

alcoa’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company or the industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoa’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

alcoa may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies deployment of companywide business process models such as alcoa’s degrees of implementation process in which ideas are executed in a disciplined manner to generate savings and overhead cost reductions there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws antibribery laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts 

while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead 

  

the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which alcoa may be liable may arise in the future at its present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by the company sites owned by its predecessors or sites that it may acquire in the future compliance with environmental health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than the company anticipates alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

climate change climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia québec’s transition to a “cap and trade” system with compliance required beginning 2013 the european union emissions trading scheme and the united states’ clean power plan for existing power plants proposed on june 18 2014 alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers or alcoa’s supply chain inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly from changes in costs of goods sold 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other 

  

natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations

italian energy matter 

as previously reported before 2002 alcoa purchased power in italy in the regulated energy market and received a drawback of a portion of the price of power under a special tariff in an amount calculated in accordance with a published resolution of the italian energy authority energy authority resolution n 2041999 “2041999” in 2001 the energy authority published another resolution which clarified that the drawback would be calculated in the same manner and in the same amount in either the regulated or unregulated market at the beginning of 2002 alcoa left the regulated energy market to purchase energy in the unregulated market subsequently in 2004 the energy authority introduced regulation no 1482004 which set forth a different method for calculating the special tariff that would result in a different drawback for the regulated and unregulated markets alcoa challenged the new regulation in the administrative court of milan and received a favorable judgment in 2006 following this ruling alcoa continued to receive the power price drawback in accordance with the original calculation method through 2009 when the european commission declared all such special tariffs to be impermissible “state aid” in 2010 the energy authority appealed the 2006 ruling to the consiglio di stato final court of appeal on december 2 2011 the consiglio di stato ruled in favor of the energy authority and against alcoa thus presenting the opportunity for the energy regulators to seek reimbursement from alcoa of an amount equal to the difference between the actual drawback amounts received over the relevant time period and the drawback as it would have been calculated in accordance with regulation 1482004 on february 23 2012 alcoa filed its appeal of the decision of the consiglio di stato this appeal was subsequently withdrawn in march 2013 on march 26 2012 alcoa received a letter from the agency cassa conguaglio per il settore eletrico ccse responsible for making and collecting payments on behalf of the energy authority demanding payment in the amount of approximately 110 million €85 million including interest by letter dated april 5 2012 alcoa informed ccse that it disputes the payment demand of ccse since i ccse was not authorized by the consiglio di stato decisions to seek payment of any amount ii the decision of the consiglio di stato has been appealed see above and iii in any event no interest should be payable on april 29 2012 law no 44 of 2012 “442012” came into effect changing the method to calculate the drawback on february 21 2013 alcoa received a revised request letter from ccse demanding alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl make a payment in the amount of 97 million €76 million including interest which reflects a revised calculation methodology by ccse and represents the high end of the range of reasonably possible loss associated with this matter of 0 to 97 million €76 million alcoa has rejected that demand and has formally challenged it through an appeal before the administrative court on april 5 2013 the administrative court scheduled a hearing for december 19 2013 which was subsequently postponed until april 17 2014 and further postponed until june 19 2014 on this date the administrative court listened to alcoa’s oral argument and on september 2 2014 rendered its decision the administrative court declared the payment request of ccse and the energy authority to alcoa to be unsubstantiated based on the 1482004 resolution with respect to the january 19 2007 through november 19 2009 timeframe on december 18 2014 the ccse and the energy authority appealed the administrative court’s september 2 2014 decision however a date for the hearing has not been scheduled at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter 

european commission matters 

as previously reported in july 2006 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy to some energyintensive industries complied with european union eu state aid rules the italian power tariff extended the tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 alcoa had been incurring higher power costs at its smelters in italy subsequent to the tariff end date through the end of 2012 the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 prior to expiration of the tariff in 2005 alcoa had been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government the ec’s announcement expressed concerns about whether italy’s extension of the tariff beyond 2005 was compatible with eu legislation and potentially distorted competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs 

  

on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and therefore the italian government is to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest the amount of this recovery was to be based on a calculation prepared by the italian government see below in late 2009 after discussions with legal counsel and reviewing the bases on which the ec decided including the different considerations cited in the ec decision regarding alcoa’s two smelters in italy alcoa recorded a charge of 250 million €173 million which included 20 million €14 million to write off a receivable from the italian government for amounts due under the now expired tariff structure and 230 million €159 million to establish a reserve on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal of this decision with the general court of the eu see below prior to 2012 alcoa was involved in other legal proceedings related to this matter that separately sought the annulment of the ec’s july 2006 decision to open an investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules and requested injunctive relief to suspend the effectiveness of the ec’s november 19 2009 decision however the decisions by the general court and subsequent appeals to the european court of justice resulted in the denial of these remedies 

in june 2012 alcoa received formal notification from the italian government with a calculated recovery amount of 375 million €303 million this amount was reduced by 65 million €53 million for amounts owed by the italian government to alcoa resulting in a net payment request of 310 million €250 million in a notice published in the official journal of the european union on september 22 2012 the ec announced that it had filed an action against the italian government on july 18 2012 to compel it to collect the recovery amount on october 17 2013 the european court of justice ordered italy to so collect on september 27 2012 alcoa received a request for payment in full of the 310 million €250 million by october 31 2012 following discussions with the italian government regarding the timing of such payment alcoa paid the requested amount in five quarterly installments of 69 million €50 million beginning in october 2012 through december 2013 notwithstanding the payments made alcoa’s estimate of the most probable loss of the ultimate outcome of this matter and the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss which is 193 million €159 million to 369 million €303 million remains the 193 million €159 million recorded in 2009 the us dollar amount reflects the effects of foreign currency movements since 2009 alcoa no longer has a reserve for this matter instead alcoa has a noncurrent asset reflecting the excess of the total of the five payments made to the italian government over the reserve recorded in 2009 at december 31 2014 the noncurrent asset was 111 million €91 million this does not include the 64 million €53 million for amounts owed by the italian government to alcoa mentioned above 

on october 16 2014 alcoa received notice from the general court of the eu that its april 19 2010 appeal of the ec’s november 19 2009 decision was denied on december 27 2014 alcoa filed an appeal of the general court’s october 16 2014 ruling to the european court of justice a decision by the european court of justice in this matter could take up to two years or longer 

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites the most significant of these matters including the remediation of the grasse river in massena ny are discussed in the environmental matters section of note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on pages 125128 

as previously reported in august 2005 dany lavoie a resident of baie comeau in the canadian province of québec filed a motion for authorization to institute a class action and for designation of a class representative against alcoa canada ltd alcoa limitée societe canadienne de metaux reynolds limitée and canadian british aluminum in the superior court of québec in the district of baie comeau plaintiff seeks to institute the class action on behalf of a putative class consisting of all past present and future owners tenants and residents of baie comeau’s st georges 

  

neighborhood he alleges that defendants as the present and past owners and operators of an aluminum smelter in baie comeau have negligently allowed the emission of certain contaminants from the smelter specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or “pahs” that have been deposited on the lands and houses of the st georges neighborhood and its environs causing damage to the property of the putative class and causing health concerns for those who inhabit that neighborhood plaintiff originally moved to certify a class action sought to compel additional remediation to be conducted by the defendants beyond that already undertaken by them voluntarily sought an injunction against further emissions in excess of a limit to be determined by the court in consultation with an independent expert and sought money damages on behalf of all class members in may 2007 the court authorized a class action suit to include only people who suffered property damage or personal injury damages caused by the emission of pahs from the smelter in september 2007 plaintiffs filed the claim against the original defendants which the court had authorized in may alcoa has filed its statement of defense and plaintiffs filed an answer to that statement alcoa also filed a motion for particulars with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiffs’ answer and a motion to strike with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiffs’ answer in late 2010 the court denied these motions the soderberg smelting process that plaintiffs allege to be the source of emissions of concern have ceased operations and are being dismantled no further formal court proceedings or discovery has occurred while technical advisors nominated by agreement of the parties confer on potential health impacts of prior emissions this protocol has been agreed to by the parties who have also advised the court regarding the process the plaintiffs have not quantified the damages sought without such amount and given the various damages alleged at this stage of the proceeding the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

as previously reported in october 2006 in barnett et al v alcoa and alcoa fuels inc warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601pl499 fortyone plaintiffs sued alcoa inc and a subsidiary asserting claims similar to those asserted in musgrave v alcoa et al warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601ct006 in november 2007 alcoa inc and its subsidiary filed a motion to dismiss the barnett cases in october 2008 the warrick county circuit court granted alcoa’s motions to dismiss dismissing all claims arising out of alleged occupational exposure to wastes at the squaw creek mine but in november 2008 the trial court clarified its ruling indicating that the order does not dispose of plaintiffs’ personal injury claims based upon alleged “recreational” or nonoccupational exposure plaintiffs also filed a “second amended complaint” in response to the court’s orders granting alcoa’s motion to dismiss on july 7 2010 the court granted the parties’ joint motions for a general continuance of trial settings discovery in this matter remains stayed  the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss because plaintiffs have merely alleged that their medical condition is attributable to exposure to materials at the squaw creek mine but no further information is available due to the discovery stay 

as previously reported in 1996 alcoa acquired the fusina italy smelter and rolling operations and the portovesme italy smelter both of which are owned by alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl from alumix an entity owned by the italian government alcoa also acquired the extrusion plants located in feltre and bolzano italy at the time of the acquisition alumix indemnified alcoa for preexisting environmental contamination at the sites in 2004 the italian ministry of environment moe issued orders to alcoa trasformazioni srl and alumix for the development of a cleanup plan related to soil contamination in excess of allowable limits under legislative decree and to institute emergency actions and pay natural resource damages on april 5 2006 alcoa trasformazioni srl’s fusina site was also sued by the moe and minister of public works mopw in the civil court of venice for an alleged liability for environmental damages in parallel with the orders already issued by the moe alcoa trasformazioni srl appealed the orders defended the civil case for environmental damages and filed suit against alumix as discussed below similar issues also existed with respect to the bolzano and feltre plants based on orders issued by local authorities in 2006 most if not all of the underlying activities occurred during the ownership of alumix the governmental entity that sold the italian plants to alcoa 

  

as noted above in response to the 2006 civil suit by the moe and mopw alcoa trasformazioni srl filed suit against alumix claiming indemnification under the original acquisition agreement but brought that suit in the court of rome due to jurisdictional rules in june 2008 the parties alcoa and now ligestra srl ligestra the successor to alumix signed a preliminary agreement by which they have committed to pursue a settlement the court of rome accepted the request and postponed the court’s expert technical assessment reserving its ability to fix the deadline depending on the development of negotiations alcoa and ligestra agreed to a settlement in december 2008 with respect to the feltre site ligestra paid the sum of 108 million euros and alcoa committed to clean up the site further postponements were granted by the court of rome and the next hearing is fixed for july 15 2015 in the meantime alcoa trasformazioni srl and ligestra reached a preliminary agreement for settlement of the liabilities related to fusina allocating 80 and 20 of the remediation costs to ligestra and alcoa respectively in january 2014 a final agreement with ligestra was signed and on february 5 2014 alcoa signed a final agreement with the moe and mopw settling all environmental issues at the fusina site as set out in the agreement between alcoa and ligestra those two parties will share the remediation costs and environmental damages claimed by the moe and mopw the remediation project filed by alcoa and ligestra has been approved by the moe see note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “fusina and portovesme italy” on page 127 to provide time for settlement with ligestra the moe and alcoa jointly requested and the civil court of venice has granted a series of postponements of hearings in the venice trial assuming that the case will be closed following the settlement the parties caused the court to dismiss the proceedings 

alcoa and ligestra have signed a similar agreement relating to the portovesme site however that agreement is contingent upon final acceptance of the proposed soil remediation project for portovesme that was rejected by the moe in the fourth quarter of 2013 alcoa submitted a revised proposal in may 2014 and intends to submit a further revised proposal in february 2015 in agreement with ligestra alcoa is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss beyond what is described in footnote n to the consolidated financial statements for several reasons first the moe has approved the remediation plan for fusina only and certain costs relating to the remediation are not yet fixed in connection with the proposed plan for portovesme the company understands that the moe has substantial discretion in defining what must be managed under the italian soils law the availability of appropriate landfills must also be considered as well as the nature of these sites as a result the scope and cost of the final remediation plan remain uncertain for portovesme in addition even though the plan was rejected by the moe and the settlement with ligestra relating to portovesme has become void alcoa should be held responsible only for its share of pollution however the area is impacted by many sources of pollution as well as historical pollution consequently the allocation of liabilities would need a very complex technical evaluation by the authorities that has not yet been performed 

as previously reported on november 30 2010 alcoa world alumina brasil ltda awab received notice of a lawsuit that had been filed by the public prosecutors of the state of pará in brazil in november 2009 the suit names awab and the state of pará which through its environmental agency had issued the operating license for the company’s new bauxite mine in juruti the suit concerns the impact of the project on the region’s water system and alleges that certain conditions of the original installation license were not met by awab in the lawsuit plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction suspending the operating license and ordering payment of compensation on april 14 2010 the court denied plaintiffs’ request awab presented its defense in march 2011 on grounds that it was in compliance with the terms and conditions of its operating license which included plans to mitigate the impact of the project on the region’s water system in april 2011 the state of pará defended itself in the case asserting that the operating license contains the necessary plans to mitigate such impact that the state monitors the performance of awab’s obligations arising out of such license that the licensing process is valid and legal and that the suit is meritless the company’s position is that any impact from the project had been fully repaired when the suit was filed the company also believes that jará lake has not been affected by any project activity and any evidence of pollution from the project would be unreliable following the preliminary injunction the plaintiffs took no further action until october 2014 when in response to the court’s request and as required by statute they restated the original allegations in the lawsuit the company is not certain whether or when the action will proceed given that this proceeding is in its preliminary stage and the current uncertainty in this case the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss

as previously reported in september 2010 following a corporate income tax audit covering the 2003 through 2005 tax years an assessment was received as a result of spain’s tax authorities disallowing certain interest deductions claimed by a spanish consolidated tax group owned by the company an appeal of this assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court by the company was denied in october 2013 in december 2013 the company filed an appeal of the assessment in spain’s national court 

additionally following a corporate income tax audit of the same spanish tax group for the 2006 through 2009 tax years spain’s tax authorities issued an assessment in july 2013 similarly disallowing certain interest deductions in august 2013 the company filed an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s central tax administrative court which was denied in january 2015 the company expects to file an appeal of this second assessment in spain’s national court in march 2015 

the combined assessments remeasured for a tax rate change enacted in november 2014 total 277 million €228 million the company believes it has meritorious arguments to support its tax position and intends to vigorously litigate the assessments through spain’s court system however in the event the company is unsuccessful a portion of the assessments may be offset with existing net operating losses available to the spanish consolidated tax group additionally it is possible that the company may receive similar assessments for tax years subsequent to 2009 at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter 

as previously reported between 2000 and 2002 alumínio sold approximately 2000 metric tons of metal per month from its poços de caldas facility located in the state of minas gerais the “state” to alfio a customer also located in the state sales in the state were exempted from valueadded tax vat requirements alfio subsequently sold metal to customers outside of the state but did not pay the required vat on those transactions in july 2002 alumínio received an assessment from state auditors on the theory that alumínio should be jointly and severally liable with alfio for the unpaid vat in june 2003 the administrative tribunal found alumínio liable and alumínio filed a judicial case in the state in february 2004 contesting the finding in may 2005 the court of first instance found alumínio solely liable and a panel of a state appeals court confirmed this finding in april 2006 alumínio filed a special appeal to the superior tribunal of justice stj in brasilia the federal capital of brazil later in 2006 in 2011 the stj through one of its judges reversed the judgment of the lower courts finding that alumínio should neither be 

  

solely nor jointly and severally liable with alfio for the vat which ruling was then appealed by the state in august 2012 the stj agreed to have the case reheard before a fivejudge panel a decision from this panel is pending but additional appeals are likely at december 31 2014 the assessment totaled 49 million r130 million including penalties and interest while the company believes it has meritorious defenses the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome 

other contingencies 

in addition to the matters discussed above various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against alcoa including those pertaining to environmental product liability safety and health and tax matters while the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that the company’s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on the financial position of the company

overview 

our business 

alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing alcoa’s innovative multimaterial products which include aluminum titanium and nickel are used worldwide in aircraft automobiles commercial transportation packaging building and construction oil and gas defense consumer electronics and industrial applications 

  

alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina combined through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry technology mining refining smelting fabricating and recycling aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily sales of primary aluminum and alumina represent approximately 40 of alcoa’s revenues the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 

alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries based upon the country where the point of sale occurred the united states and europe generated 51 and 27 respectively of alcoa’s sales in 2014 in addition alcoa has investments and operating activities in among others australia brazil china guinea iceland russia and saudi arabia all of which present opportunities for substantial growth governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates affect the results of operations in these countries 

management review of 2014 and outlook for the future 

in 2014 growth in global aluminum demand reached 7 which was consistent with management’s projection at the end of 2013 the lme price of aluminum remained relatively stable compared to 2013 however regional premiums increased substantially significantly benefitting the smelting portion of alcoa’s upstream operations the refining portion of the upstream operations continued to make progress in shifting customer pricing away from the lme aluminum price to a mixture of alumina pricing index and spot pricing additionally the midstream and downstream operations continued to grow revenue through innovations and share gains cost headwinds continued to be a challenge however management was able to more than offset these with net productivity improvements across all operations alcoa also realized the benefit of a stronger us dollar in 2014 compared to 2013 as a result of all of the foregoing each of alcoa’s operations achieved improved results over 2013 

separately from the 2014 operational results management initiated a number of portfolio actions during the year in the upstream operations following similar actions taken in 2013 smelting capacity of 424 kmt was permanently closed of which 150 kmt was previously curtailed and 159 kmt was temporarily curtailed which in turn led to the temporary curtailment of 200 kmt in refining capacity additionally in the midstream operations 200 kmt of can sheet capacity was permanently closed management also completed the divestiture of four operations within the upstream and midstream operations that were no longer part of the strategic direction of alcoa these included a majority ownership interest in both a mining and refining joint venture and a smelter and whollyowned interests in three rolling mills and an aluminum rod plant from a growth perspective alcoa completed the acquisition of an aerospace business and entered into an agreement to purchase another both of which will enhance the portfolio of alcoa’s downstream operations 

management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies overhead rationalization working capital and disciplined capital spending this focus and the related results enabled alcoa to end 2014 with a strengthened balance sheet 

the following financial information reflects certain key measures of alcoa’s 2014 results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

in 2015 management is projecting continued growth increase of 7 in the global consumption of primary aluminum consistent with that of the last three years led by china at an estimated 10 all other regions in the world are expected to have positive growth in aluminum demand over 2013 including north america at an estimated 5 after considering forecasted added production along with few industrywide capacity curtailments management anticipates a balanced aluminum market for alumina growth in global consumption is estimated to be 6 and supply is expected to slightly exceed overall demand due to added production in china as well as other parts of the world 

management also anticipates improved market conditions for valueadded products in the aerospace automotive building and construction packaging and industrial gas turbine global end markets despite declines in certain regions while the commercial transportation global end market is expected to be flat 

aerospace is expected to be driven by large commercial aircraft due to an eightyear order backlog as well as strength in orders for regional jets for automotive growth is anticipated in both the united states due to the replacement of older vehicles low borrowing rates and the decline in gasoline prices and china due to new clean air legislation and a continued increase in the percentage of the population driving automobiles in building and construction awarded nonresidential contracts are up once again in north america while the decline in europe continues for packaging growth in china and europe mainly driven by the penetration of aluminum in the growing beer segment and the continued conversion from steel cans to aluminum cans respectively is expected to more than offset a slight decrease in north america industrial gas turbines are expected to see growth as a result of new demand for high technology turbines and upgrades of existing turbines in commercial transportation strong production in north america underpinned by significant order backlog is expected to be offset by weakness in europe including from the impact of sanctions on russia 

on a companywide basis management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2015 

 

  

  

 looking ahead over the next two years management will focus on the 2016 strategic targets that were set at the end of 2013 these targets include lowering alcoa’s refining and smelting operations on the respective global cost curves to the 21st from 27th and 38th from 43rd percentiles respectively additionally the targets include driving revenue growth while improving margins that meet or exceed historical levels in the midstream increase of 1000 and downstream increase of 1200 operations of which 90 and 75 respectively is expected to be generated from innovation and share gains the following describes the progress made on these targets in 2014 as well as future expectations 

at december 31 2014 alcoa’s refining operations were at the 25th percentile a twopercentage point improvement and its smelting operations were at the 43rd percentile on the respective cost curves in 2014 actions taken to improve alcoa’s position on the cost curve for both refining and smelting operations included productivity improvements both new initiatives as well as the full realization of those implemented in 2013 additionally for the refining operations alcoa curtailed approximately 200 kmt of highcost capacity and increased production by approximately 200 kmt from lowcost capacity the smelting operations also permanently closed 274 kmt of high cost capacity in australia and the united states while the benefits of these actions can be seen in alcoa’s improved position on the refining cost curve at the end of 2014 the benefits in the smelting operations were offset by the strong us dollar 

other actions taken in 2014 to help drive a lower position on the respective cost curves include the sales of ownership interests in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica and a smelter in the united states the sales of these operations occurred late in 2014 therefore management expects to realize the benefits of divesting this highcost capacity in 2015 also in late 2014 the refining operations 

  

completed the conversion of the fuel source from fuel oil to natural gas at a refinery in spain and the smelting operations renewed power contracts at each of the three smelters in canada all of which are expected to yield significant cost savings beginning in 2015 additionally as previously mentioned alcoa has initiatives to drive further productivity improvements during 2015 furthermore the smelter and the refinery at the joint venture in saudi arabia are fully operational and are expected to provide a twopercentage point reduction on each of the respective cost curves by the end of 2016 

in 2014 the midstream and downstream operations generated revenue of 7351 and 6006 respectively representing an increase of 245 and 273 81 was related to an acquisition—see below respectively compared to the 2013 baselines the increase related to the midstream operations was mostly due to rising demand for aluminum sheet from the us automotive end market as a result of changing emission regulations a significant portion of this demand is being met by alcoa’s davenport ia rolling mill facility which completed an expansion to meet this demand in january 2014 for the downstream operations the increase excluding the acquisition was largely attributable to higher demand for both alcoa’s fasteners and jet engine components products from the commercial aerospace end market and alcoa’s aluminum wheels in the commercial transportation end market 

beyond the improvement in 2014 revenue growth for both the midstream and downstream operations is expected from multiple sources in mid 2014 alcoa entered into two 1000 multiyear supply agreements with two major customers one to supply aluminum sheet and plate from the midstream operations and the other to supply jet engine components from the downstream operations additionally the midstream operations anticipate positive contributions from both the davenport facility as production continues to rampup to serve growing demand and alcoa’s tennessee rolling mill facility which expects to complete an expansion to meet automotive demand in 2015 likewise the downstream operations expect favorable results from projects completed in late 2014 or expected to be completed in 2015 to meet growing demand in both the aerospace and commercial transportation end markets these projects include an expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in lafayette in expansions in laporte in and hampton va to provide nickelbased super alloy structural components and airfoil blades for jet engines and an expansion at a facility in hungary to double production of aluminum wheels 

separately from the organic growth described above alcoa acquired an aerospace jet engine components company firth rixson in november 2014 firth rixson generated approximately 970 of revenue in 2014 of which 81 was reflected in alcoa’s statement of consolidated income and is expected to generate approximately 1600 of revenue by 2016 see engineered products and solutions in segment information under results of operations below 

results of operations 

earnings summary 

net income attributable to alcoa for 2014 was 268 or 021 per diluted share compared with net loss attributable to alcoa of 2285 or 214 per share in 2013 the improvement in results of 2553 was primarily due to the absence of all of the following an impairment of goodwill a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and charges for the resolution of a legal matter other significant changes in results included the following higher energy sales a higher average realized price for primary aluminum net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements these other changes were mostly offset by higher charges related to a number of portfolio actions eg capacity reductions divestitures acquisitions higher overall input costs and an unfavorable change in income taxes due to higher operating results 

net loss attributable to alcoa for 2013 was 2285 or 214 per share compared with net income attributable to alcoa of 191 or 018 per share in 2012 the decrease in results of 2476 was mostly due to an impairment of goodwill a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and charges for the resolution of a legal matter other significant changes in results included the following a lower average realized price for aluminum in the upstream and midstream businesses higher input costs across three of the four segments the absence of a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets and restructuring and other charges related to the permanent shutdown 

  

of smelter capacity these other changes were mostly offset by net productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements the absence of both a net charge for certain environmental remediation matters and a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter and stronger volumes in three of the four segments 

sales— sales for 2014 were 23906 compared with sales of 23032 in 2013 an improvement of 874 or 4 the increase was mainly the result of higher volumes in the midstream downstream and alumina portion of the upstream operations higher energy sales resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity increased buyresell activity for primary aluminum and a higher average realized price for primary aluminum these items were partially offset by lower primary aluminum volumes including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity and unfavorable priceproduct mix in the midstream operations 

sales for 2013 were 23032 compared with sales of 23700 in 2012 a decline of 668 or 3 the decrease was primarily due to lower primary aluminum volumes including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity a decline in the average realized price for primary aluminum driven by lower london metal exchange lme prices and unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices these items were somewhat offset by higher volumes in the alumina portion of the upstream operations and the midstream and downstream operations 

cost of goods sold— cogs as a percentage of sales was 801 in 2014 compared with 837 in 2013 the percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments both the previously mentioned higher energy sales and higher average realized price for primary aluminum net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar lower costs for caustic and carbon and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in australia these items were partially offset by higher costs for bauxite energy and labor writeoffs of inventory related to the decisions to permanently shut down certain smelter and rolling mill capacity difference of 58—see restructuring and other charges below and costs related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at 10 locations in the united states see below 

on june 6 2014 the united steelworkers ratified a new fiveyear labor agreement covering approximately 6100 employees at 10 us locations the previous labor agreement expired on may 15 2014 in 2014 as a result of the preparation for and ratification of the new agreement alcoa recognized 18 12 aftertax in cogs for among other items business contingency costs and a onetime signing bonus for employees additionally as a result of the provisions of the new labor agreement a significant plan amendment was adopted by one of alcoa’s us pension plans accordingly this plan was required to be remeasured which resulted in a 13 decrease to 2014 net periodic benefit cost 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 837 in 2013 compared with 861 in 2012 the percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments the absence of a net charge for five environmental remediation matters 194 net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and a positive impact related to the march 2012 fire at the cast house in massena ny insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012 these items were partially offset by the previously mentioned realized price impacts and higher input costs including those related to bauxite mining and a planned maintenance outage at a power plant 

selling general administrative and other expenses— sga expenses were 995 or 42 of sales in 2014 compared with 1008 or 44 of sales in 2013 the decline of 13 was due to decreases in various expenses including legal and consulting fees and contract services mostly offset by costs associated with an acquisition of an aerospace business 42—see engineered products and solutions in segment information below and higher stockbased compensation expense 

sga expenses were 1008 or 44 of sales in 2013 compared with 997 or 42 of sales in 2012 the increase of 11 was principally the result of higher labor costs partially offset by a decrease in professional expenses and contract services and lower bad debt expense 

  

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 218 in 2014 compared with 192 in 2013 and 197 in 2012 the increase in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily caused by spending related to an upgrade of a micromill™ in san antonio tx for the global rolled products segment and additional spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the primary metals segment the decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly driven by lower spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the primary metals segment and other various projects mostly offset by spending related to an upgrade of a micromill™ in san antonio tx for the global rolled products segment the micromill™ upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 and as a result the micromill™ will develop and qualify aluminum products for the automotive end market 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1371 in 2014 compared with 1421 in 2013 the decrease of 50 or 4 was principally the result of net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar particularly against the australian dollar and brazilian real and a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in australia canada the united states and italy that occurred at different points during both 2013 and 2014 see primary metals in segment information below these items were somewhat offset by new dda associated with both the acquisition of an aerospace business in november 2014 see engineered products and solutions in segment information below and assets placed into service in january 2014 related to the completed automotive expansion at the davenport ia plant 

the provision for dda was 1421 in 2013 compared with 1460 in 2012 the decrease of 39 or 3 was mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar particularly against the australian dollar and brazilian real a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in canada the united states and italy that occurred mid2013 see primary metals in segment information below and the absence of expense due to the divestiture of us hydroelectric power assets in late 2012 see primary metals in segment information below these items were slightly offset by new depreciation associated with a hydroelectric power project in brazil machadinho in early 2013 there was a change in the legal structure of the entity that owned the project resulting in alcoa recording its 3099 share of the project’s assets directly whereas in 2012 alcoa’s share was recorded as an equity method investment 

impairment of goodwill— in 2013 alcoa recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of 1731 1719 after noncontrolling interest related to the annual impairment review of the primary metals segment see goodwill in critical accounting policies and estimates below 

restructuring and other charges— restructuring and other charges for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2014 were comprised of the following 

 

 layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 

2014 actions in 2014 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 1168 703 aftertax and noncontrolling interest which were comprised of the following components 693 443 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for exit costs related to decisions to permanently shut down and demolish three smelters and two rolling mills see below 332 163 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for the divestitures of four operations see alumina primary metals 

  

and global rolled products in segment information below 68 45 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for the temporary curtailment of two smelters and a related production slowdown at one refinery see below 51 36 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for layoff costs including the separation of approximately 1120 employees 550 in the engineered products and solutions segment 45 in the global rolled products segment 60 in the alumina and primary metals segments combined and 465 in corporate 34 26 aftertax for asset impairments related to prior capitalized costs for a modernization project at a smelter in canada that is no longer being pursued a net charge of 18 11 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for other miscellaneous items including 2 2 aftertax for asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and 28 21 aftertax and noncontrolling interest for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods including those associated with a smelter in italy due to changes in facts and circumstances see below 

in early 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the remaining capacity 84 kmtperyear at the massena east smelter in new york and the full capacity 190 kmtperyear at the point henry smelter in australia the capacity at massena east was fully shut down by the end of march 2014 and the point henry smelter was fully shut down in august 2014 demolition and remediation activities related to both the massena east and point henry smelters began in late 2014 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 and 2018 respectively 

the decisions on the massena east and point henry smelters were part of a 15month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in may 2013 see 2013 actions below for possible curtailment through this review management determined that the remaining capacity of the massena east smelter was no longer competitive and the point henry smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable management also initiated the temporary curtailment of the remaining capacity 62 kmtperyear at the poços de caldas smelter and additional capacity 85 kmtperyear at the são luís smelter both in brazil these curtailments were completed by the end of may 2014 as a result of these curtailments 200 kmtperyear of production at the poços de caldas refinery was reduced by the end of june 2014 

also in early 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown of alcoa’s two rolling mills in australia point henry and yennora this decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both australia and asia the two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmtperyear and were closed by the end of 2014 demolition and remediation activities related to the two rolling mills will begin in 2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018 

additionally in august 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the capacity 150 kmtperyear at the portovesme smelter in italy which had been idle since november 2012 this decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged including the lack of a viable longterm power solution demolition and remediation activities related to the portovesme smelter will begin in 2015 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2019 

in 2014 costs related to the shutdown and curtailment actions included 208 for the layoff of approximately 1790 employees 1210 in the primary metals segment 470 in the global rolled products segment 80 in the alumina segment and 30 in corporate including 26 in pension costs accelerated depreciation of 204 related to the three facilities in australia as they continued to operate during 2014 asset impairments of 166 representing the writeoff of the remaining book value of all related properties plants and equipment and 183 in other exit costs additionally in 2014 remaining inventories mostly operating supplies and raw materials were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 67 47 aftertax and noncontrolling interest which was recorded in cost of goods sold on alcoa’s statement of consolidated operations the other exit costs represent 95 in asset retirement obligations and 42 in environmental remediation both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish the aforementioned structures in australia italy and the united states and 46 in other related costs including supplier and customer contractrelated costs 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 2185 of the 2910 employees were separated the remaining separations for the 2014 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2015 in 2014 cash payments of 141 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2014 restructuring programs 

  

2013 actions in 2013 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 782 585 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 391 305 aftertax and noncontrolling interest related to a legal matter 245 183 aftertax for exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations see below 87 61 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for layoff costs including the separation of approximately 1110 employees 340 in the primary metals segment 260 in the engineered products and solutions segment 250 in the global rolled products segment 85 in the alumina segment and 175 in corporate of which 590 relates to a global overhead reduction program and 9 in pension plan settlement charges related to previously separated employees 25 17 aftertax in net charges including 12 8 aftertax for asset impairments related to retirements andor the sale of previously idled structures 25 13 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for asset impairments related to the writeoff of capitalized costs for projects no longer being pursued due to the market environment a net charge of 17 12 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other miscellaneous items including 3 2 aftertax for asset impairments and 8 6 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods 

in may 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines capacity of 105 kmtperyear that utilize soderberg technology at the baie comeau smelter in québec canada remaining capacity of 280 kmtperyear composed of two prebake potlines and the full capacity 44 kmtperyear at the fusina smelter in italy additionally in august 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline capacity of 41 kmtperyear that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east smelter in new york remaining capacity of 84 kmtperyear composed of two soderberg potlines the aforementioned soderberg lines at baie comeau and massena east were fully shut down by the end of september 2013 while the fusina smelter was previously temporarily idled in 2010 demolition and remediation activities related to all three facilities began in late 2013 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2015 for massena east and by the end of 2017 for both baie comeau and fusina 

the decisions on the soderberg lines for baie comeau and massena east were part of a 15month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in may 2013 for possible curtailment while the decision on the fusina smelter was in addition to the capacity being reviewed factors leading to all three decisions were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution italy changed market fundamentals other existing idle capacity and restart costs 

in 2013 exit costs related to the shutdown actions included 114 for the layoff of approximately 550 employees primary metals segment including 83 in pension costs accelerated depreciation of 58 baie comeau and asset impairments of 18 fusina and massena east representing the writeoff of the remaining book value of all related properties plants and equipment and 55 in other exit costs additionally in 2013 remaining inventories mostly operating supplies and raw materials were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 9 6 aftertax which was recorded in cost of goods sold on alcoa’s statement of consolidated operations the other exit costs represent 48 in asset retirement obligations and 5 in environmental remediation both of which were triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 2 in other related costs 

as of december 31 2014 approximately 1440 of the 1530 employees previously 1660 were separated the total number of employees associated with the 2013 restructuring programs was updated to reflect employees who were initially identified for separation accepting other positions within alcoa and natural attrition the remaining separations for the 2013 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2015 in 2014 and 2013 cash payments of 39 and 33 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to the 2013 restructuring programs 

2012 actions in 2012 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 172 106 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 85 33 aftertax and noncontrolling interest related to the civil portion of a legal matter 47 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 800 employees 390 in the engineered products and solutions segment 250 in the primary metals segment 85 in the alumina segment and 75 in corporate including 10 7 aftertax for the layoff of an additional 170 employees 

  

related to the previously reported smelter curtailments in spain 30 30 aftertax in asset impairments and 6 6 aftertax for lease and contract termination costs due to a decision to exit the lithographic sheet business in bohai china 11 11 aftertax in costs to idle the portovesme smelter 10 8 aftertax in other asset impairments a net charge of 4 4 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other miscellaneous items and 21 15 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods including 10 7 aftertax related to the smelters in spain the reversal related to the smelters in spain was due to lower than expected costs based on agreements with employee representatives and the government as well as a reduction of 55 in the number of layoffs due to the anticipation of the restart of a portion of the previously curtailed capacity based on an agreement with the spanish government that will provide interruptibility rights ie compensation for power interruptions when grids are overloaded to the smelters during 2013 see primary metals in segment information below a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded at the end of 2011 and a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded during 2012 see above 

as of december 31 2013 the separations associated with 2012 restructuring programs were essentially complete in 2014 2013 and 2012 cash payments of 3 17 and 16 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to the 2012 restructuring programs 

alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense— interest expense was 473 in 2014 compared with 453 in 2013 the increase of 20 or 4 was principally caused by lower capitalized interest 43 largely due to the progress completed at the aluminum complex in saudi arabia and fees paid associated with the execution and termination of a 364day senior unsecured bridge term loan facility related to the acquisition of an aerospace business 13—see engineered products and solutions in segment information below these items were partially offset by a 3 lower average debt level and lower amortization of debtrelated costs due to the conversion of convertible notes the lower average debt level was mostly attributable to lower outstanding longterm debt due to the march 2014 conversion of 575 in 525 convertible notes and the june 2013 repayment of 422 in 600 notes partially offset by the september 2014 issuance of 1250 in 5125 notes 

interest expense was 453 in 2013 compared with 490 in 2012 the decrease of 37 or 8 was primarily due to a 7 lower average debt level which was mostly attributable to lower outstanding longterm debt due to the june 2013 repayment of 422 in 600 notes and payments associated with the loans supporting growth projects in brazil 

other expenses income net— other expenses net was 47 in 2014 compared with other income net of 25 in 2013 the change of 72 was mostly due to an unfavorable change in marktomarket derivative aluminum contracts 42 net unfavorable foreign currency movements 34 a higher equity loss related to alcoa’s share of the joint venture in saudi arabia due to startup costs of the entire complex including restart costs for one of the smelter potlines that was previously shut down due to a period of instability and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance these items were somewhat offset by a gain on the sale of i a mining interest in suriname 28 and ii an equity investment in a china rolling mill 14 

  

other income net was 25 in 2013 compared with 341 in 2012 the change of 316 was mainly the result of the absence of a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets 320 see primary metals in segment information below also a higher equity loss 40 related to alcoa’s share of the joint venture in saudi arabia due to startup costs and a shutdown of one of the two smelter potlines due to a period of instability was partially offset by net favorable foreign currency movements 28 

income taxes— alcoa’s effective tax rate was 644 provision on income in 2014 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate mainly due to restructuring charges related to operations in italy no tax benefit and australia benefit at a lower tax rate see restructuring and other charges above a 52 31 after noncontrolling interest discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in brazil see below a loss on the sale of three rolling mills in europe no tax benefit see global rolled products in segment information below and a 27 16 after noncontrolling interest discrete income tax charge for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets of a subsidiary in spain due to a november 2014 enacted tax rate change from 30 in 2014 to 28 in 2015 to 25 in 2016 these items were somewhat offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a 9 discrete income tax benefit for the release of a valuation allowance related to operations in germany due to the initiation of a tax planning strategy 

in december 2011 one of alcoa’s subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations during 2013 the application was amended and refiled and separately a similar application was filed for another one of the company’s subsidiaries in brazil the deadline for the brazilian government to deny the application was july 11 2014 since alcoa did not receive notice that its applications were denied the tax holiday took effect automatically on july 12 2014 as a result the tax rate for these subsidiaries decreased significantly from 34 to 1525 resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10year holiday period retroactively effective as of january 1 2013 additionally a portion of one of the subsidiaries net deferred tax asset that reverses within the holiday period was remeasured at the new tax rate the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary was not remeasured since it could still be utilized against the subsidiary’s future earnings not subject to the tax holiday this remeasurement resulted in a decrease to that subsidiary’s net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of 52 31 after noncontrolling interest 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 236 in 2013 provision on a loss compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs by 586 points from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a 1731 impairment of goodwill see impairment of goodwill above and a 209 charge for a legal matter see restructuring and other charges above that are nondeductible for income tax purposes a 372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the united states see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below restructuring charges related to operations in canada benefit at a lower tax rate and italy no tax benefit see restructuring and other charges above and a 9 discrete income tax charge related to prior year taxes in spain and australia these items were slightly offset by an 18 discrete income tax benefit related to new us tax legislation see below 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions through 2013 two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted alcoa are the lookthrough rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit the expiration of these two provisions resulted in alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of 18 in 2012 as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment alcoa recognized an 18 discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions beginning on january 1 2014 these two provisions once again expired on december 19 2014 the tax increase prevention act of 2014 was signed into law which retroactively extended for one year ie calendar year 2014 a number of the tax provisions that expired at the end of 2013 including the two specific aforementioned provisions for tax years beginning after december 31 2014 these two provisions once again expire absent a retroactive extension enacted in 2015 alcoa would recognize a higher income tax provision of 12 in 2015 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 500 provision on income in 2012 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax impact from the gain 

  

recognized on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets see primary metals in segment information below and an 8 discrete income tax charge related to prior year us taxes on certain depletable assets slightly offset by a 13 discrete income tax benefit related to a change in the legal structure of an investment 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2015 will be between 30 and 35 however changes in the current economic environment tax legislation or rate changes currency fluctuations ability to realize deferred tax assets and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 

noncontrolling interests— net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was 91 in 2014 compared with net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 41 in 2013 and net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 29 in 2012 these amounts were virtually all related to the results of alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac which is owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited 

in 2014 awac generated a smaller loss compared to 2013 mainly driven by the absence of a 384 charge for a legal matter see below and improved operating results mostly offset by restructuring and other charges associated with both the decision to permanently shut down the point henry smelter in australia see restructuring and other charges above and the divestiture of an ownership interest in a mining and refining joint venture in jamaica see alumina in segment information below and a combined 79 32 was noncontrolling interest’s share discrete income tax charge related to a tax rate change in both brazil and spain see income taxes above the improvement in awac’s operating results was principally due to net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements partially offset by an increase in input costs even though awac generated an overall loss in both 2014 and 2013 the noncontrolling interest’s share resulted in income in 2013 due to the manner in which the charges and costs related to a legal matter were allocated see below 

in 2013 awac generated a higher loss compared to 2012 primarily related to a 384 charge for a legal matter partially offset by improved operating results and the absence of an 85 charge related to the civil portion of the same legal matter the increase in awac’s operating results was largely driven by net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements somewhat offset by an increase in input costs even though awac generated an overall loss in both 2013 and 2012 the noncontrolling interest’s share resulted in income in 2013 due to the manner in which the charges and costs related to the legal matter were allocated a description of how these charges for this legal matter impacted noncontrolling interests follows 

the noncontrolling interest’s share of awac’s charge for a legal matter in 2013 and 2012 was 58 related to the aforementioned 384 and 34 related to the aforementioned 85 respectively in 2012 the 34 was based on the 40 ownership interest of alumina limited while in 2013 the 58 was based on 15 the application of a different percentage was due to the criteria in a 2012 allocation agreement between alcoa and alumina limited related to this legal matter being met additionally the 34 charge as well as costs related to this legal matter was retroactively adjusted to reflect the terms of the allocation agreement resulting in a credit to noncontrolling interests of 41 in 2013 in summary noncontrolling interests included a charge of 17 and 34 related to this legal matter in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

segment information 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals global rolled products and engineered products and solutions segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges and other items including intersegment profit eliminations differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 

  

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 2043 in 2014 1217 in 2013 and 1357 in 2012 the following information provides shipments sales and atoi data for each reportable segment as well as certain production realized price and average cost data for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2014 see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information 

alumina 

 

  this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide refinery system including the mining of bauxite which is then refined into alumina alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products a portion of this segment’s thirdparty sales are completed through the use of agents alumina traders and distributors more than half of alcoa’s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment 

in december 2014 alcoa’s majorityowned subsidiary awac completed the sale of its ownership stake in jamalco a bauxite mine and alumina refinery joint venture in jamaica to noble group ltd jamalco was 55 owned by a subsidiary of awac and while owned by awac 55 of both the operating results and assets and liabilities of this joint venture were included in the alumina segment as it relates to awac’s previous 55 ownership stake the refinery awac’s share of the capacity was 779 kmtperyear generated sales thirdparty and intersegment of approximately 200 in 2013 and the refinery and mine combined at the time of divestiture had approximately 500 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

in 2014 alumina production decreased by 12 kmt compared to 2013 the decline was mainly driven by lower production at the poços de caldas brazil jamalco jamaica and san ciprian spain refineries mostly offset by higher production at every other refinery in the global system the poços de caldas refinery started to reduce production in early 2014 in response to management’s decision to fully curtail the poços de caldas smelter by the end of may 2014 see primary metals below as a result management reduced the alumina production at the poços de caldas refinery by approximately 200 kmtperyear by mid2014 this reduction was replaced by an increase in production at lower cost refineries within alcoa’s global system additionally the decrease at the refinery in jamaica was due to the absence of production for one month as a result of the sale of the ownership stake in jamalco 

in 2013 alumina production increased by 276 kmt compared to 2012 the improvement was mostly the result of higher production in the atlantic refinery system primarily at the point comfort tx refinery 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment improved 6 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily related to a 7 improvement in volume 

thirdparty sales for this segment increased 8 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely attributable to an increase of 7 in volume and positive impacts from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and spot pricing somewhat offset by a decrease in contractual lmebased pricing fewer sales subject to lme pricing and lower average lme prices for those sales subject to lme pricing 

  

intersegment sales for the alumina segment decreased 13 in 2014 compared with 2013 and declined 3 in 2013 compared with 2012 the decrease in both periods was mostly the result of lower demand from the primary metals segment 

atoi for the alumina segment improved 111 in 2014 compared with 2013 mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar especially against the australian dollar net productivity improvements and a gain on the sale of a mining interest in suriname 18 these positive impacts were partially offset by higher input costs including natural gas particularly higher prices in australia bauxite mainly due to a new mining site in suriname and labor and maintenance all of which were somewhat offset by lower costs for caustic and a higher equity loss due to startup costs of the bauxite mine and refinery in saudi arabia 

atoi for this segment increased 169 in 2013 compared with 2012 mainly caused by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar especially against the australian dollar and net productivity improvements these positive impacts were somewhat offset by cost increases for bauxite due to a new mining site in suriname and a crusher equipment move in australia rising natural gas prices in australia and higher maintenance costs in australia and latin america 

in 2015 alumina production will be approximately 700 kmt lower due to the sale of the interest in the jamaica refinery also the continued shift towards alumina index and spot pricing is expected to average 75 of thirdparty shipments additionally net productivity improvements are anticipated and lower energy costs are expected in spain due to the conversion of the fuel source at the refinery from fuel oil to natural gas furthermore the refinery in saudi arabia is expected to produce 1100 kmt 276 kmt is alcoa’s share of alumina as it became fully operational at the end of 2014 

primary metals 

 

   

 this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide smelter system primary metals receives alumina mostly from the alumina segment and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa’s fabricating businesses as well as sold to external customers and traders results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess power are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buyresell activity primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents approximately 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales buyresell activity occurs when this segment purchases metal and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 

  

in november 2014 alcoa completed the sale of an aluminum rod plant located in bécancour québec canada to sural laminated products this facility takes molten aluminum and shapes it into the form of a rod which is used by customers primarily for the transportation of electricity while owned by alcoa the operating results and assets and liabilities of this plant were included in the primary metals segment in conjunction with this transaction alcoa entered into a multiyear agreement with sural laminated products to supply molten aluminum for the rod plant the aluminum rod plant generated sales of approximately 200 in 2013 and at the time of divestiture had approximately 60 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

in december 2014 alcoa completed the sale of its 5033 ownership stake in the mt holly smelter located in goose creek south carolina to century aluminum company while owned by alcoa 5033 of both the operating results and assets and liabilities related to the smelter were included in the primary metals segment as it relates to alcoa’s previous 5033 ownership stake the smelter alcoa’s share of the capacity was 115 kmtperyear generated sales of approximately 280 in 2013 and at the time of divestiture had approximately 250 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

in november 2012 alcoa completed the sale of its 351megawatt tapoco hydroelectric project “tapoco” to brookfield renewable energy partners for 597 in cash alcoa recognized a gain of 320 173 aftertax in other income net on the statement of consolidated operations of which a gain of 426 275 aftertax was reflected in the primary metals segment and a loss of 106 102 aftertax was reflected in corporate the amount in corporate represents the writeoff of goodwill and capitalized interest related to tapoco that were not included in the assets of the primary metals segment tapoco is a fourstation hydroelectric project located on the little tennessee and cheoah rivers in eastern tennessee and western north carolina the transaction included four generating stations and dams 86 miles of transmission lines and approximately 14500 acres of land associated with and surrounding tapoco the power generated by tapoco was primarily consumed by alcoa’s smelter in tennessee which was temporarily idled in 2009 and permanently shut down in 2011 since 2009 the power generated from tapoco was sold into the open market 

at december 31 2014 alcoa had 665 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 3497 kmt in 2014 idle capacity increased 10 kmt compared to 2013 due to the temporary curtailment of 159 kmt combined at two smelters in brazil mostly offset by the permanent closure of the portovesme smelter in italy 150 kmtperyear base capacity declined 540 kmt between december 31 2014 and 2013 due to the permanent closure of a smelter in australia and two remaining potlines at a smelter in the united states 274 kmt combined and the previously mentioned permanent shutdown of the portovesme smelter and the sale of alcoa’s ownership stake in the mt holly smelter see above a detailed description of each of these actions follows 

at december 31 2013 alcoa had 655 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4037 kmt in 2013 idle capacity increased 64 kmt compared to 2012 mostly due to the temporary curtailment of 131 kmt combined at two smelters in brazil partially offset by the permanent closure of the fusina smelter in italy 44 kmtperyear and the restart of a portion 27 kmt combined of the capacity that was temporary curtailed in 2012 related to the avilés and la coruña smelters in spain base capacity declined 190 kmt between december 31 2013 and 2012 due to the permanent closure of three potlines combined at smelters in canada and in the united states 146 kmt combined and the previously mentioned permanent shutdown of the fusina smelter a detailed description of each of these actions follows 

the restarts in spain occurred in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime in the spanish power market in december 2012 the spanish government issued a ministerial order that modified the interruptibility regime previously in place in the spanish power market the interruptibility regime allowed certain industrial customers who were willing to be subject to temporary interruptions in the supply of power to sell interruption rights to the high voltage transmission system operator in january 2013 alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell interruption services under the modified regime from its san ciprian avilés and la coruña smelters in spain the commitment was taken for a oneyear period which was subsequently extended until december 2014 in september 2014 spanish regulation imposed a budget cap on the revenues associated with the sale of interruption services resulting in higher energy costs for the three smelters during the last three months of 2014 in late 2014 a new market 

  

based interruptibility regime replaced the previously regulated interruptibility regime resulting in a competitive auction process to allocate interruptibility rights in spain for calendar year 2015 through this process alcoa was able to secure the sale of enough interruptibility rights to operate all three smelters in spain at competitive energy prices during 2015 the structure of the energy market in spain subsequent to 2015 is unknown 

in may 2013 alcoa announced that management would review 460 kmt of smelting capacity over a 15month period for possible curtailment this review was aimed at maintaining alcoa’s competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and would focus on the highestcost smelting capacity and those plants that have longterm risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty 

as part of this review also in may 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines 105 kmtperyear that utilize soderberg technology at the baie comeau smelter in quebec canada additionally in august 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline 41 kmtperyear that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east ny plant the shutdown of these three lines was completed by the end of september 2013 the baie comeau smelter has a remaining capacity of 280 kmtperyear composed of two prebake potlines and the massena east smelter had a remaining capacity of 84 kmtperyear composed of two soderberg potlines see below 

also in august 2013 as part of this review management initiated the temporary curtailment of 97 kmt at the são luís smelter and 31 kmt at the poços de caldas smelter both in brazil this action was also completed by the end of september 2013 an additional 3 kmt was temporarily curtailed at the poços de caldas smelter by the end of 2013 

the review of the remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity was completed during 2014 also during 2014 an additional 250 kmt of smelting capacity was included in the review 

in early 2014 management initiated three additional actions resulting in the permanent shutdown of an additional 274 kmt of capacity and the temporary curtailment of an additional 147 kmt of capacity 

the permanent shutdowns were comprised of the remaining capacity 84 kmtperyear at the massena east smelter and the full capacity 190 kmtperyear at the point henry smelter in australia the remaining capacity of the massena east smelter represented two soderberg potlines that were no longer competitive this shutdown was completed by the end of march 2014 for point henry management determined that the smelter had no prospect of becoming financially viable the shutdown of the point henry smelter was completed in august 2014 

the temporary curtailments were comprised of the remaining capacity 62 kmtperyear at the poços de caldas smelter and additional capacity 85 kmtperyear at the são luís smelter the process of curtailing this additional capacity began in march 2014 and was completed by the end of may 2014 an additional 12 kmt was temporarily curtailed at the são luís smelter during the remainder of 2014 

separate from the review in june 2013 management decided to permanently close the fusina smelter as the underlying conditions that led to the idling of the smelter in 2010 had not fundamentally changed including low aluminum prices and the lack of an economically viable longterm power solution in august 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown of the portovesme smelter which had been idle since november 2012 this decision was made because the fundamental reasons that made the portovesme smelter uncompetitive remained unchanged including the lack of a viable longterm power solution 

see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above for a description of the associated charges related to all of the above actions 

in 2014 aluminum production decreased by 425 kmt mostly due to lower andor the absence of production at the five smelters impacted by the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions described above 

  

in 2013 aluminum production declined by 192 kmt mainly the result of the absence of production at the portovesme smelter fully curtailed at the end of 2012 the temporary curtailment of capacity at two smelters in brazil see above and the permanent shutdown of three potlines combined at smelters in canada and in the united states see above 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment increased 3 in 2014 compared with 2013 mainly due to higher energy sales in brazil resulting from excess power due to curtailed smelter capacity higher buyresell activity and a 7 increase in average realized aluminum price mostly offset by lower volumes including from the five smelters impacted by the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions the change in average realized price was driven by higher regional premiums which increased by an average of 84 in the united states and canada and 56 in europe 

thirdparty sales for this segment declined 11 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower volumes including from the curtailed smelters in italy spain and brazil and the permanent shutdown of certain capacity in canada and the united states also contributing to the decrease was a 4 decline in average realized prices somewhat offset by higher energy sales related to excess power mostly in brazil and favorable product mix the change in realized prices was driven by an 8 lower average lme price on 15day lag somewhat offset by higher regional premiums including an average of 12 in the united states and canada and 13 in europe 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment improved 12 in 2014 compared with 2013 principally due to an increase in realized prices driven by higher regional premiums and higher demand from the midstream and downstream businesses intersegment sales for this segment declined 9 in 2013 compared with 2012 mainly the result of a decrease in both realized prices driven by a lower lme price and demand from the midstream and downstream businesses 

atoi for the primary metals segment climbed 614 in 2014 compared with 2013 principally related to a higher average realized aluminum price the previously mentioned energy sales in brazil net productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar against all major currencies lower costs for carbon and alumina and the absence of costs related to a planned maintenance outage in 2013 at a power plant in australia these positive impacts were slightly offset by an unfavorable impact associated with the 2013 and 2014 capacity reductions described above including a writeoff of inventory related to the decisions to permanently shut down the portovesme point henry and massena east smelters 44 and higher costs for energy particularly in spain—see above labor and maintenance 

atoi for this segment decreased 329 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily caused by a decline in realized prices the absence of a gain on the sale of tapoco see above higher costs for labor and transportation a higher equity loss related to the joint venture in saudi arabia due to startup costs and a shutdown of one of the two potlines due to a period of instability and costs related to a planned maintenance outage at the anglesea power plant in australia these negative impacts were somewhat offset by lower costs for carbon and energy net productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar against most major currencies favorable product mix and a positive impact insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012 related to the march 2012 fire at the massena west cast house 36 

in 2015 aluminum production will be approximately 270 kmt lower due to the sale of the ownership stake in the mt holly smelter and the shutdown and curtailment actions described above also energy sales in brazil will be negatively impacted by approximately 100 due to a decline in energy prices additionally net productivity improvements are anticipated and the smelter in saudi arabia is expected to provide a positive contribution to atoi as it became fully operational in mid 2014 furthermore lower energy costs in canada are anticipated due to new power contracts executed in late 2014 

  

global rolled products 

 

 this segment represents alcoa’s midstream operations whose principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate and sheet a small portion of this segment’s operations relate to foil produced at one plant in brazil this segment includes rigid container sheet rcs which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans seasonal increases in rcs sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year approximately onehalf of the thirdparty shipments in this segment consist of rcs this segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace automotive commercial transportation building and construction and industrial products mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables end markets which is sold directly to customers and through distributors while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of rcs sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers 

in february 2014 management approved the permanent shutdown of alcoa’s two rolling mills in australia point henry and yennora this decision was made due to the significant impact of excess can sheet capacity in both australia and asia the two rolling mills had a combined can sheet capacity of 200 kmtperyear and were closed by the end of 2014 see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above for a description of the associated charges 

in december 2014 alcoa completed the sale of three rolling mills located in spain alicante and amorebieta and france castelsarrasin to a subsidiary of atlas holdings llc while owned by alcoa the operating results and assets and liabilities of the rolling mills were included in the global rolled products segment in conjunction with this transaction alcoa entered into a multiyear agreement with the buyer to supply aluminum for the rolling mills the rolling mills combined generated sales of approximately 500 in 2013 and at the time of divestiture had approximately 750 employees see restructuring and other charges in results of operations above 

thirdparty sales for the global rolled products segment improved 3 in 2014 compared with 2013 principally caused by increased demand somewhat offset by unfavorable priceproduct mix related to the packaging aerospace and industrial products end markets volume improvements were mostly driven by the automotive and commercial transportation end markets 

thirdparty sales for this segment declined 4 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily driven by unfavorable pricing mostly due to a decrease in metal prices and unfavorable product mix partially offset by increased demand volume improvements were mostly due to the packaging automotive and building and construction end markets partially offset by a decline in the industrial products end market especially in north america 

atoi for the global rolled products segment improved 60 in 2014 compared with 2013 mainly the result of net productivity improvements across most businesses a positive impact from the timing lag in metal prices ie this segment realized a lower average cost of metal purchased compared to the average metal price realized in sales due to its rising trend during 2014 and overall higher volumes these items were partially offset by unfavorable priceproduct mix related to the packaging aerospace and industrial products end markets higher input costs including energy labor maintenance and transportation a writeoff of inventory related to the decision to permanently shut down the point henry and yennora rolling mills 9 a larger equity loss due to startup costs related to the rolling 

  

mill at the joint venture in saudi arabia and costs business continuity and contract specific related to a new labor agreement that covers employees at three rolling mills in the united states 4 see cost of goods sold in results of operations above 

atoi for this segment declined 94 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily attributable to a combination of unfavorable pricing and product mix higher input costs including metal premiums energy and labor and a negative impact from the timing lag in metal prices ie this segment realized a lower average metal price in sales compared to the average cost of the metal purchased these items were partially offset by net productivity improvements across most businesses 

in 2015 demand in the automotive end market is expected to remain strong and the automotive expansion at the davenport ia facility will continue to rampup to serve the growing demand for aluminumintensive vehicles also pricing pressure due to continued oversupply in both the packaging and industrial products end markets is expected additionally thirdparty sales will decline by approximately 1000 due to the divestiture and closure of five rolling mills see above furthermore net productivity improvements are anticipated while higher research and development costs are anticipated as alcoa develops and qualifies products from a new micromill™ production process 

engineered products and solutions 

 

 this segment represents alcoa’s downstream operations and includes titanium aluminum and super alloy investment castings fasteners aluminum wheels integrated aluminum structural systems architectural extrusions and forgings and hard alloy extrusions these products which are used in the aerospace automotive building and construction commercial transportation power generation and industrial products end markets are sold directly to customers and through distributors 

on november 19 2014 after satisfying all customary closing conditions and receiving the required regulatory approvals alcoa completed the acquisition of firth rixson a global leader in aerospace jet engine components firth rixson manufactures rings forgings and metal products for the aerospace end market as well as other markets requiring highly engineered material applications this business generated sales of approximately 970 in 2014 and has 13 operating facilities in the united states united kingdom europe and asia employing approximately 2400 people combined the purpose of this acquisition is to strengthen alcoa’s aerospace business and position the company to capture additional aerospace growth with a broader range of highgrowth valueadd jet engine components alcoa expects thirdparty sales of the firth rixson business to increase to 1600 and 2000 by 2016 and 2019 respectively in executing its integration plan for firth rixson alcoa expects to realize annual cost savings of more than 100 by 2019 due to synergies derived from procurement and productivity improvements optimizing internal metal supply and leveraging alcoa’s global shared services this transaction is expected to be neutral to earnings in 2015 and accretive thereafter the operating results and assets and liabilities of firth rixson were included within the engineered products and solutions segment since the date of acquisition thirdparty sales and atoi of firth rixson from the acquisition date through december 31 2014 were 81 and 12 respectively 

in december 2014 alcoa signed a definitive agreement to acquire tital a privately held company based in germany tital’s business is composed primarily of aluminum and titanium investment casting products for the aerospace and defense end markets the purpose of this acquisition is to capture increasing demand for advanced jet engine components made of titanium establish titanium casting capabilities in europe and expand existing aluminum casting capacity the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of march 2015 at that time tital will be included within the engineered products and solutions segment tital generated sales of approximately 100 in 2013 and has approximately 650 employees 

  

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment increased 5 in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher volumes and the acquisition of firth rixson see above the higher volumes were mostly related to the commercial transportation and aerospace commercial end markets somewhat offset by lower volumes in the industrial gas turbine end market 

thirdparty sales for this segment improved 4 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely attributable to higher volumes related to the aerospace end market 

atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment climbed 41 in 2014 compared with 2013 mainly due to net productivity improvements across all businesses and overall higher volumes partially offset by higher costs primarily labor and unfavorable product mix 

atoi for this segment rose 114 in 2013 compared with 2012 principally the result of net productivity improvements across all businesses and the previously mentioned volume impact somewhat offset by higher costs including labor and research and development expenses and unfavorable priceproduct mix 

in 2015 the commercial aerospace end market is expected to remain strong driven by significant order backlog while improvement in the industrial gas turbine end market is anticipated as the market moves towards higher valueadd products also the building and construction end market is expected to improve through growth in north america for the nonresidential sector but will be somewhat offset by overall weakness in europe additionally stronger north america build rates in the commercial transportation end market will be offset by declines in europe and china furthermore thirdparty sales are expected to grow significantly due to the acquisition of firth rixson and the planned acquisition of tital see above and net productivity improvements across existing and newlyacquired businesses are anticipated

liquidity and capital resources 

alcoa maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet in 2014 as in the prior five years management initiated actions to significantly improve alcoa’s cost structure and liquidity providing the company with the ability to operate effectively such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures in 2015 this approach will continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures by a minimum of 500 

along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa’s operational and business needs over the next 12 months for an analysis of longterm liquidity see contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements below 

at december 31 2014 cash and cash equivalents of alcoa were 1877 of which 800 was held outside the united states alcoa has a number of commitments and obligations related to the company’s growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions resulting in the need for cash outside the united states as such management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions 

cash from operations 

cash provided from operations in 2014 was 1674 compared with 1578 in 2013 the increase of 96 or 6 was due to higher operating results net income plus net addback for noncash transactions in earnings and a positive change in noncurrent assets of 134 mostly offset by a negative change associated with working capital of 620 a negative change in noncurrent liabilities of 251 and higher pension contributions of 39 

the components of the negative change in working capital were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the higher pension contributions of 39 were principally driven by special termination benefits of 86 for employees affected by the 2013 shutdown of capacity at a smelter in canada 

on august 8 2014 the highway and transportation funding act hatfa was signed into law by the united states government hatfa in part provides temporary relief for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension plans 

  

related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 specifically hatfa modifies the interest rates that had been set in 2012 by the moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act this relief had an immediate impact on the calculation of the then remaining funding contributions in 2014 resulting in a reduction of 100 in minimum required pension funding 

in 2014 alcoa world alumina llc a majorityowned subsidiary of alcoa and alcoa inc paid a combined 88 to the united states government due to the resolution of a legal matter paid on january 22 2014 additionally another 74 will be paid in each of the four subsequent years 2015 paid on january 9 and 23 2015 through 2018 

cash provided from operations in 2013 was 1578 compared with 1497 in 2012 the increase of 81 or 5 was due to higher operating results net loss plus net add back for noncash impacts to earnings and lower pension contributions of 99 mostly offset by a negative change associated with all of the following working capital of 235 noncurrent assets of 162 and noncurrent liabilities of 128 

the lower pension contributions of 99 were principally driven by a change in minimum funding obligations for us pension plans due to enacted legislation in 2012 see below

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities environmental and litigation matters asset retirement obligations the testing of goodwill equity investments and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses to be divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

derivatives and hedging derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program for derivatives designated as fair value hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or 

  

other income or expense in the current period if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense 

alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing longterm debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges as a result the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense consistent with the underlying hedged item 

alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales cost of goods sold or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures generally not exceeding five years 

if no hedging relationship is designated the derivative is marked to market through earnings 

cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

  

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record an aro for the removal treatment transportation storage andor disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks polychlorinated biphenyls various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2014 ranges from less than 1 to 46 per structure 136 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has nine reporting units of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment the primary metals segment all goodwill was impaired in 2013 – see below the global rolled products segment and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil hereafter “sae” which is included in corporate more than 80 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs 1145 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1590 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment these amounts include an allocation of corporate’s goodwill in november 2014 alcoa acquired an aerospace business firth rixson see engineered products and solutions in segment information above and as a result recognized 1898 in goodwill this amount will be allocated between the afs and the alcoa forgings and extrusion reporting units both of which are part of the engineered products and solutions segment however none of this goodwill is reflected in the 1145 above for afs since the annual impairment review was completed prior to the acquisition 

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the existing twostep quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test 

alcoa’s policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test management will proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill this policy will result in each of the eight reporting units with goodwill being subjected to the twostep quantitative impairment test at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the 

  

type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2014 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for five reporting units the global rolled products segment and four of the five reporting units in the engineered products and solutions segment including afs and app management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the five reporting units were less than their carrying values as such no further analysis was required 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices production costs tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

during the 2014 annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for three reporting units as follows the alumina segment sae and one of the five reporting units in the engineered products and solutions segment the estimated fair values of these three reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value resulting in no impairment 

goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units except for the primary metals segment in 2013 see below and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test 

in 2013 for primary metals the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value as a result management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of primary metals’ goodwill the results of the secondstep analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero therefore in the fourth quarter of 2013 alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of 1731 1719 after noncontrolling interest as a result of the goodwill impairment there is no goodwill remaining for the primary metals reporting unit 

the impairment of primary metals’ goodwill resulted from several causes the prolonged economic downturn a disconnect between industry fundamentals and pricing that has resulted in lower metal prices and the increased cost of alumina a key raw material resulting from expansion of the alumina price index throughout the industry all of these factors exacerbated by increases in discount rates continue to place significant downward pressure on metal prices and operating margins and the resulting estimated fair value of the primary metals business as a result management decreased the nearterm and longterm estimates of the operating results and cash flows utilized in assessing primary 

  

metals’ goodwill for impairment the valuation of goodwill for the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is considered a level 3 fair value measurement which means that the valuation of the assets and liabilities reflect management’s own judgments regarding the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortia which are accounted for on the equity method the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking consumer products transportation insurance and pharmaceutical among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2014 2013 and 2012 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 400 480 and 415 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 460 and either a charge or credit of approximately 20 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fouryear average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on the annual 10year moving and 20year moving averages when developing this assumption management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2014 2013 and 2012 management used 800 850 and 850 as its expected longterm rate of return which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class these rates fell within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class in 2014 the decrease of 50 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return was due to a combination of a decrease in the 20year moving average of actual performance and lower future expected market returns at that time for 2015 management has determined that 775 will be the expected longterm rate of return the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return is due to lower future expected market returns 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 20 for 2014 

during 2014 an independent us organization that publishes standard mortality rates based on statistical analysis and studies issued updated mortality tables the rates within these standard tables are used by actuaries as one of the many assumptions when measuring a company’s projected benefit obligation for pension and other postretirement benefit plans the funded status of all of alcoa’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are measured as of december 31 each calendar year during the measurement process at the end of 2014 alcoa with the assistance of an external actuary considered the rates in the new mortality tables along with specific data related to alcoa’s retiree population to develop the mortalityrelated assumptions used to measure the benefit obligation of various us benefit plans as a result alcoa recognized a charge of approximately 100 65 aftertax in other comprehensive loss related to the updated mortality assumptions 

in 2014 a net charge of 99 69 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to an 80 basis point decrease in the discount rate and a change in the mortality assumption see above which was mostly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses in 2013 a net benefit of 876 531 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 65 basis point increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses in 2012 a net charge of 769 529 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 75 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility annual forfeiture rate and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

equity grants are issued in january each year as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2014 2013 and 2012 was 87 58 aftertax 71 48 aftertax and 67 46 aftertax respectively of this amount 15 14 and 13 in 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

  

most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not greater than 50 that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and alcoa’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

in 2013 alcoa recognized a 372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the united states of this amount a 237 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets related to a spanish consolidated tax group these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2016 for certain credits to an unlimited life for operating losses after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the tax benefit of these deferred tax assets this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business 2013 realized prices were the lowest since 2009 combined with prior year cumulative losses of the spanish consolidated tax group during 2014 the underlying value of the deferred tax assets decreased due to a remeasurement as a result of the enactment of new tax rates in spain beginning in 2015 see income taxes in earnings summary under results of operations above the sale of a member of the spanish consolidated tax group and a change in foreign currency exchange rates as a result the valuation allowance decreased by the same amount at december 31 2014 the amount of the valuation allowance was 163 this valuation allowance was reevaluated as of december 31 2014 and no change to the allowance was deemed necessary based on all available evidence the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result a portion or all of the allowance may be reversed based on changes in facts and circumstances 

the remaining 135 relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of available foreign tax credits in the united states these credits can be carried forward for 10 years and have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2023 as of december 31 2013 2015 to 2019 as of december 31 2014 after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the full tax benefit of these foreign tax credits this was primarily due to lower foreign sourced taxable income after consideration of tax planning strategies and after the inclusion of earnings from foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends this valuation allowance was reevaluated as of december 31 2014 and no change to the allowance was deemed necessary based on all available evidence the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result an increase or decrease to this allowance may result based on changes in facts and circumstances 

  

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

overview 

alcoa is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing alcoa’s innovative multimaterial products which include aluminum titanium and nickel are used worldwide in aircraft automobiles commercial transportation packaging building and construction oil and gas defense consumer electronics and industrial applications 

alcoa is also the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina combined through its active participation in all major aspects of the industry technology mining refining smelting fabricating and recycling aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily aluminum primary and fabricated and alumina represent approximately 80 of alcoa’s revenues and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa 

alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries based upon the country where the point of sale occurred the us and europe generated 51 and 26 respectively of alcoa’s sales in 2013 in addition alcoa has investments and 

  

operating activities in among others australia brazil china guinea iceland russia and saudi arabia all of which present opportunities for substantial growth governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates affect the results of operations in these countries 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals global rolled products and engineered products and solutions 

description of the business 

information describing alcoa’s businesses can be found on the indicated pages of this report 

 

 the following tables and related discussion of the company’s bauxite interests alumina refining and primary aluminum facilities and capacities global rolled products engineered products and solutions and corporate facilities provide additional description of alcoa’s businesses the alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac alcoa owns 60 and alumina limited owns 40 of these individual entities for more information on awac see exhibit nos 10a through 10f1 to this report 

bauxite interests 

aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust and is produced primarily from bauxite an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide commonly referred to as alumina aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina the company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the awac enterprise located in the countries listed in the table below as well as pursuant to both longterm and shortterm contracts and mining leases during 2013 alcoa consumed 41 million metric tons mt from awac and its own resources and 7 million mt from entities in which the company has an equity interest tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons bdmt unless otherwise stated see the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this section 

the company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from today for purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as feedstock to its refineries the company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves bauxite 

  

resources represent deposits for which tonnage densities shape physical characteristics grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits and include diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining metallurgical economic marketing legal environmental social and governmental factors alcoa employs a conventional approach including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing alcoa to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves 

the table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the company while the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for our mining locations given the company’s extensive bauxite resources the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the company’s rights to bauxite it is not costeffective to invest the significant resources necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the company rather bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future 

bauxite resource development guidelines 

alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with alcoa’s internal guidelines as administered by the alcoa ore reserve committee aorc the reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions alcoa does not use a price for bauxite alumina or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves the primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery in addition to these specifications a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material alcoa mining locations have annual infill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve classification of their bauxite

 sources and availability of raw materials 

the major raw materials purchased in 2013 for each of the company’s reportable segments are listed below 

 

 generally other materials are purchased from third party suppliers under competitivelypriced supply contracts or bidding arrangements the company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available 

  

for each metric ton of alumina produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

 for each metric ton of aluminum produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

 explanatory note certain aluminum produced by alcoa also includes alloying materials because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce alcoa’s various alloys providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful with the exception of a very small number of internally used products alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to an aluminum association standard the aluminum association of which alcoa is an active member uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types in general each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also have other constituents as well but of lesser amounts 

energy 

employing the bayer process alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power energy accounts for approximately 25 of the company’s total alumina refining production costs electric power accounts for approximately 26 of the company’s primary aluminum production costs alcoa generates approximately 20 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters and refineries 

north america – electricity 

the deschambault baie comeau and bécancour smelters in québec purchase electricity under existing contracts that run through 2015 which will be followed by longterm contracts with hydroquébec first executed in december 2008 revised twice in 2012 and 2013 and expiring in 2040 provided that alcoa completes the modernization of the baie comeau smelter by september 2019 the smelter located in baie comeau québec completed the permanent closure of its two remaining soderberg potlines in september 2013 consequently reducing its annual production by 105000 metric tons following this curtailment the baiecomeau smelter now purchases approximately 74 of its power needs under the hydroquébec contract and the remainder from a 40 owned hydroelectric generating company manicougan power limited partnership furthermore in october 2013 alcoa provided hydroquébec with advanced 

  

notification to reduce to close to zero its purchasing obligation under the power contracts for the three smelters effective at the end of 2014 alcoa’s provision of such advanced notification to hydroquébec does not require alcoa to reduce its electricity consumption accordingly however providing such notification ensures that alcoa would have the right to do so if it deems such an action to be necessary 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 29 of the power requirements for alcoa’s smelters operating in the us the company generally purchases power under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates the yadkin hydroelectric project consisting of four dams in north carolina and the warrick coalfired power plant located in indiana 

for several years apgi has been pursuing a new longterm license for the yadkin hydroelectric project from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc in 2007 apgi filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc a relicensing settlement agreement signed by a majority of interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues the national environmental policy act process is complete with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in april 2008 the remaining requirement for relicensing was the issuance by north carolina of the required water quality certification under section 401 of the clean water act north carolina’s department of environment and natural resources denr issued a section 401 water quality certification on may 7 2009 but it was appealed and has been stayed since late may 2009 pending substantive determination on the appeal in september 2012 apgi filed a new application for a 401 certificate seeking a fresh review of its application however on august 2 2013 the state of north carolina filed suit in state court seeking a declaratory ruling that it not apgi owns the yadkin riverbed beneath the hydroelectric project as well as a portion of the project dams upon the filing of the lawsuit the denr denied apgi’s 401 certificate asserting that it cannot review the application given the dispute over ownership of the lands and the project apgi has appealed that denial in the administrative court of north carolina and has also informed ferc of the appeal a necessary step to demonstrate that the relicensing proceeding remains pending before ferc apgi removed the riverbed lawsuit to federal court in 2013 

pending completion of the relicensing process apgi received yeartoyear license renewals from ferc starting in may 2008 and will continue to operate under annual licenses until a new section 401 certification is issued and the ferc relicensing process is complete since the permanent closure of the badin north carolina smelter power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing llc and then sold into the wholesale market proceeds from sales to the wholesale market are used to offset higher priced power contracts at other us operations 

apgi generates substantially all of the power used at the company’s warrick indiana smelter using nearby coal reserves since may 2005 alcoa has owned the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves with the friendsville mine being operated by vigo coal company inc the friendsville mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year in june 2011 the red brush west mine owned by alcoa and operated by vigo coal was opened and produced approximately 60000 tons per month over an eighteenmonth period but operation ceased in 2013 in the second quarter of 2013 liberty mine also owned by alcoa and operated by vigo coal began producing coal and is operating at a level of approximately one million tons per year friendsville and liberty mines together combine to supply 95 of the power plant’s future needs the balance of the coal used is royalty coal or purchased coal from the illinois basin 

in the state of washington alcoa’s wenatchee smelter operates under a contract with chelan county public utility district chelan pud under which alcoa receives approximately 26 of the hydropower output of chelan pud’s rocky reach and rock island dams 

starting on january 1 2013 the intalco smelter began receiving physical power from the bonneville power administration bpa pursuant to a new contract executed between alcoa and bpa under which alcoa receives physical power at the northwest power act mandated industrial firm power ip rate through september 30 2022 

prior to 2007 power for the rockdale smelter in texas was historically supplied from companyowned generating units and units owned by luminant generation company llc formerly txu generation company lp luminant 

  

both of which used lignite supplied by the company’s sandow mine upon completion of lignite mining in the sandow mine in 2005 lignite supply transitioned to the formerly alcoaowned three oaks mine the company retired its three whollyowned generating units at rockdale sandow units 1 2 and 3 in late 2006 and transitioned to an arrangement under which luminant is to supply all of the rockdale smelter’s electricity requirements under a longterm power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038 with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price in august 2007 luminant and alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which luminant has constructed and operates a new circulating fluidized bed power plant sandow unit 5 adjacent to the existing sandow unit 4 and in september 2007 on the sale of three oaks mine to luminant concurrent with entering into the agreements under which luminant constructed and operates sandow unit 5 alcoa and luminant entered into a power purchase agreement whereby alcoa purchased power from luminant that sandow unit 5 power purchase agreement was terminated by alcoa effective december 1 2010 in june 2008 alcoa temporarily idled half of the capacity at the rockdale smelter and in november 2008 curtailed the remainder of rockdale’s smelting capacity in late 2011 alcoa announced that it would permanently close two of the six idled potlines at its rockdale texas smelter demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in the first half of 2012 and were completed in 2013 in august 2012 alcoa and the lower colorado river authority lcra announced that they had entered into an agreement whereby alcoa would sell to lcra all of the real estate associated with the rockdale location along with all of alcoa’s surface and groundwater rights and certain plant and equipment assets other than the smelter and atomizer and assign alcoa’s power contracts with luminant to lcra after conducting due diligence associated with the proposed transaction lcra decided not to pursue the proposed transaction and allowed the agreement to terminate in may 2013 

in the northeast the purchased power contracts for both the massena east and massena west smelters in new york expired on december 31 2013 subject to their terms and conditions commencing on january 1 2014 the massena smelters receive physical power pursuant to a new thirtyyear energy contract executed between alcoa and the new york power authority nypa as amended in january 2011 the january 2011 amendment provides alcoa additional time to complete the design and engineering work for its massena east modernization plan implementation of the massena east modernization plan is subject to further approval of the alcoa board of directors alcoa announced on january 15 2014 the accelerated closure of the remaining potlines at its massena east smelter

 item 1a risk factors 

alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations including causing alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to alcoa or that alcoa currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods 

the aluminum industry and aluminum enduse markets are highly cyclical and are influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical and alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and aluminum enduse markets alcoa sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the commercial construction and transportation industries and the demand for our products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by our customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in the general us or worldwide economy currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond our control while alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum remain positive the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength pace or sustainability of the economic recovery and the effects of government intervention negative economic conditions such as another major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

marketdriven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by nonmarket forces or other impediments to production closures 

in response to marketdriven factors relating to the global supply and demand of aluminum alcoa has recently curtailed portions of its aluminum production certain other aluminum producers have independently undertaken to make cuts in production as well however the existence of nonmarket forces on global aluminum industry capacity such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry selfsufficiency may prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers’ smelters irrespective of their position on the industry cost curve other production cuts may be impeded by longterm contracts to buy power or raw materials if industry overcapacity persists due to the disruption by such nonmarket forces on the marketdriven balancing of the global supply and demand of aluminum the resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect the operating results of aluminum producers including alcoa 

a reduction in demand or a lack of increased demand for aluminum or aluminum products by china europe or a combined number of other countries may negatively impact alcoa’s results 

the aluminum industry’s demand is highly correlated to economic growth for example the european sovereign debt crisis had an adverse effect on european supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum products the chinese 

  

market is a significant source of global demand for commodities including aluminum a sustained slowdown in china’s economic growth and aluminum demand that is not offset by increased aluminum demand in emerging economies such as india brazil and several south east asian countries or the combined slowdown of other markets could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices a reduction in demand or a lack of increased demand in global markets could materially harm alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices and regional premiums 

the price of aluminum is frequently volatile and changes in response to general economic conditions expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories speculative trading in aluminum and the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets have also increased in recent years contributing to higher levels of price volatility in 2013 the lme price of aluminum reached a high of 2123 per metric ton and a low of 1695 per metric ton continued high lme inventories could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum declines in the lme price have had a negative impact on alcoa’s results of operations additionally alcoa’s results could be adversely affected by decreases in regional premiums that participants in the physical metal market pay for immediate delivery of aluminum which are part of the overall aluminum price a sustained weak aluminum pricing environment a deterioration in aluminum prices or a decrease in regional premiums could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts certain conditions could negatively affect alcoa’s results of operations including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if events such as those listed above were to occur the resulting high energy costs or the disruption of an energy source or the requirement to repay all or a portion of the benefit alcoa received under a power supply interruptibility regime could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business and results of operations 

alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects of decreases in commodity or lmelinked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations alcoa may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs 

  

through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results are affected by significant lag effects of declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in the lmelinked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period increases in the cost of raw materials or decreases in input costs that are disproportionate to concurrent sharper decreases in the price of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s operating results 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro and norwegian kroner may affect alcoa’s profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies while the company’s products are generally sold in us dollars 

alcoa may not be able to successfully realize goals established in each of its four business segments at the levels or by the dates targeted for such goals 

alcoa established targets for each of its four major business segments including the following 

 

  

  

  

 for more information regarding alcoa’s targets see “management review of 2013 and outlook for the future” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report there can be no assurance that any of these targets or other goals will be completed as anticipated market conditions or other factors may prevent alcoa from accomplishing its goals at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our securities 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from its growth projects or from its streamlining portfolio strategy 

alcoa’s growth projects include the joint venture with ma’aden in saudi arabia the automotive expansions in davenport iowa and alcoa tennessee the aluminum lithium capacity expansion in lafayette indiana at the alcoa technical center in pennsylvania and at the kitts green plant in the united kingdom and the china and russia growth projects although management believes that these projects will be beneficial to alcoa there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized adverse factors may prevent alcoa from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines 

alcoa has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders in addition alcoa may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities 

  

if the buyer fails to honor all commitments acquisitions also present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company and unanticipated costs and liabilities and the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully there can be no assurance that acquisitions and divestitures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to alcoa 

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future for example in december 2009 alcoa formed a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex including a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill in the kingdom of saudi arabia in november 2012 alcoa and china power investment corporation cpi established a joint venture company to produce highend fabricated aluminum products in china although the company has in connection with the saudi arabia joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the joint venture with ma’aden is subject to risks associated with large infrastructure construction projects there can be no assurance that the project as a whole will be completed within budget or that the project phases will be completed by their targeted completion dates or that it or alcoa’s other joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

alcoa faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1 business—competitive conditions of this report the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets including some that are subsidized in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets the willingness of customers to accept substitutes for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

any further downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings could limit alcoa’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs increase the pricing of its credit facilities adversely affect the market price of its securities trigger letter of credit or other collateral postings or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

alcoa’s longterm debt is currently rated bbb by standard and poor’s ratings services and bbb by fitch ratings bbb is the lowest level of investment grade rating in april 2013 both standard and poor’s and fitch lowered alcoa’s ratings outlook to negative in may 2013 moody’s investors service downgraded alcoa’s longterm debt rating from baa3 to ba1 which is below investment grade and changed the outlook from rating under review to stable there can be no assurance that one or more of these or other rating agencies will not take further negative actions with 

  

respect to alcoa’s ratings increased debt levels adverse aluminum market or macroeconomic conditions a deterioration in the company’s debt protection metrics a contraction in the company’s liquidity or other factors could potentially trigger such actions a rating agency may lower suspend or withdraw entirely a rating or place it on negative outlook or watch if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

as a result of the moody’s downgrade certain counterparties have required alcoa to post letters of credit or cash collateral and the cost of issuance of commercial paper has increased for more information regarding the effects of the downgrade on the company’s liquidity see “liquidity and capital resources—financing activities” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 

if standard  poor’s or fitch also downgrades alcoa’s credit rating below investment grade alcoa may be subject to additional requests for letters of credit or other collateral and exclusion from the commercial paper market for example under the project financings for the joint venture project in the kingdom of saudi arabia a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings below investment grade by at least two of the three rating agencies standard and poor’s moody’s and fitch would require alcoa to provide a letter of credit or fund an escrow account for a portion or all of alcoa’s remaining equity commitment to the joint venture for additional information regarding the project financings see note i to the consolidated financial statements any additional or further downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could also adversely impact the market price of alcoa’s securities adversely affect existing financing for example a downgrade by standard and poor’s or a further downgrade by moody’s would subject alcoa to higher costs under alcoa’s fiveyear revolving credit agreement and certain of its other revolving credit facilities limit access to the capital including commercial paper or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or fees on undrawn credit facilities result in vendors or counterparties seeking collateral or letters of credit from alcoa or otherwise impair alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from the change to index pricing of alumina 

alcoa has implemented a move to a pricing mechanism for alumina based on an index of alumina prices rather than a percentage of the lmebased aluminum price alcoa believes that this change more fairly reflects the fundamentals of alumina including raw materials and other input costs involved there can be no assurance that such index pricing ultimately will be accepted for all thirdparty shipments of alumina or that such index pricing will result in consistently greater profitability from sales of alumina 

alcoa’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by reductions in its capital expenditures 

alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in greenfield and brownfield projects and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities for 2014 generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending continues to be an alcoa target insufficient cash generation may negatively impact alcoa’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and growth capital projects over the long term alcoa’s ability to take advantage of improved aluminum or other market conditions may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions and the longterm value of its business could be adversely impacted the company’s position in relation to its competitors may also deteriorate 

alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates if alcoa’s interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions its growth could be constrained any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

alcoa’s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the us that have varying degrees of political and economic risk including brazil china europe guinea russia and the kingdom of saudi arabia risks 

  

include those associated with sovereign and private debt default political instability civil unrest expropriation nationalization renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements mining leases and permits commercial instability caused by corruption and changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition or operating results 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of alcoa’s intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt our business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 

alcoa faces global cybersecurity threats which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats directed at the company cyber attacks and security breaches may include but are not limited to attempts to access information computer viruses denial of service and other electronic security breaches 

we believe that alcoa faces a heightened threat of cyber attacks due to the industries we serve the locations of our operations and our technological innovations the company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past including breaches of our information technology systems in which information was taken and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication based on information known to date past attacks have not had a material impact on alcoa’s financial condition or results of operations however due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the scope and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted while the company continually works to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems or networks compromise confidential or otherwise protected information destroy or corrupt data or otherwise disrupt our operations the occurrence of such events could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties regulatory action loss of business potential liability and increased remediation costs any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition such attacks or breaches could require significant management attention and resources and result in the diminution of the value of our investment in research and development 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws antibribery laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts 

  

while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by us sites owned by our predecessors or sites that we may acquire in the future compliance with environmental health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

climate change climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia australia’s carbon pricing mechanism introduced in 2012 québec’s transition to a “cap and trade” system with compliance required beginning 2013 and the european union emissions trading scheme alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers or alcoa’s supply chain inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly from changes in costs of goods sold 

  

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect alcoa’s future profitability 

alcoa is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions alcoa’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions in addition the assumptions include assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of its tax exposures corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions significant changes to the us corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact positive or negative on alcoa’s effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

adverse decline in liability discount rate lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations or amount of pension funding contributions in future periods 

alcoa’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense alcoa records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations 

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate applied to plan liabilities and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets in addition alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how alcoa’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note w to the consolidated financial statements—pension and other postretirement benefits in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are impacted by different regulations and requirements the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities alcoa would contribute to the pension plans potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the moving ahead for progress in the 21st century act enacted in 2012 provides temporary relief for employers like alcoa who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average discount rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average discount rate for the two most recent years as currently is the case alcoa has elected this temporary relief and believes that it will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status to potential declines in discount rates over the next two to three years however higher than expected pension contributions due to a further decline in our funded status as a result of additional declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on our cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans adversely affecting alcoa’s liquidity and results of operations 

  

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

a significant portion of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates for more information see “employees” in part i item 1 business of this report the master collective bargaining agreement between alcoa and the united steelworkers which covers 10 locations and approximately 6100 us employees expires on may 15 2014 if a new longterm agreement is not reached work stoppage at some of the 10 locations could begin on may 16 2014 while alcoa was previously successful in renegotiating the agreement with the united steelworkers in june 2010 alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate this or other collective bargaining agreements in the us and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

alcoa’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

alcoa’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company or the industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoa’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

alcoa may not realize expected longterm benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies deployment of companywide business process models such as alcoa’s degrees of implementation process in which productivity ideas are executed in a series of steps and overhead cost reductions there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful or beneficial to alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments including advanced smelting process technologies such as inert anode and carbothermic technology alloy development engineered finishes and product design and manufacturing for more information on alcoa’s research and development programs see “research and development” in part i item 1 business of this report there can be no assurance that such developments or technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance further existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

italian energy matter 

as previously reported before 2002 alcoa purchased power in italy in the regulated energy market and received a drawback of a portion of the price of power under a special tariff in an amount calculated in accordance with a published resolution of the italian energy authority energy authority resolution n 2041999 “2041999” in 2001 the energy authority published another resolution which clarified that the drawback would be calculated in the same manner and in the same amount in either the regulated or unregulated market at the beginning of 2002 alcoa left the regulated energy market to purchase energy in the unregulated market subsequently in 2004 the energy authority introduced regulation no 1482004 which set forth a different method for calculating the special tariff that would result in a different drawback for the regulated and unregulated markets alcoa challenged the new regulation in the administrative court of milan and received a favorable judgment in 2006 following this ruling alcoa continued to receive the power price drawback in accordance with the original calculation method through 2009 when the european commission declared all such special tariffs to be impermissible “state aid” in 2010 the energy authority appealed the 2006 ruling to the consiglio di stato final court of appeal on december 2 2011 the consiglio di stato ruled in favor of the energy authority and against alcoa thus presenting the opportunity for the energy regulators to seek reimbursement from alcoa of an amount equal to the difference between the actual drawback amounts received over the relevant time period and the drawback as it would have been calculated in accordance with regulation 1482004 on february 23 2012 alcoa filed its appeal of the decision of the consiglio di stato this appeal was subsequently withdrawn in march 2013 on march 26 2012 alcoa received a letter from the agency cassa conguaglio per il settore eletrico ccse responsible for making and collecting payments on behalf of the energy authority demanding payment in the amount of approximately 110 million €85 million including interest by letter dated april 5 2012 alcoa informed ccse that it disputes the payment demand of ccse since i ccse was not authorized by the consiglio di stato decisions to seek payment of any amount ii the decision of the consiglio di stato has been appealed see above and iii in any event no interest should be payable on april 29 2012 law no 44 of 2012 “442012” came into effect changing the method to calculate the drawback on february 21 2013 alcoa received a revised request letter from ccse demanding alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl make a payment in the amount of 97 million €76 million including interest which reflects a revised calculation methodology by ccse and represents the high end of the range of reasonably possible loss associated with this matter of 0 to 97 million €76 million alcoa has rejected that demand and has formally challenged it through an appeal before the administrative court on april 5 2013 the administrative court scheduled a hearing for december 19 2013 which was subsequently postponed until april 17 2014 at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter 

european commission matters 

as previously reported in july 2006 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy to some energyintensive industries complied with european union eu state aid rules the italian power tariff extended the tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 alcoa had been incurring higher power costs at its smelters in italy subsequent to the tariff end date through the end of 2012 the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 prior to expiration of the tariff in 2005 alcoa had been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government the ec’s announcement expressed concerns about whether italy’s extension of the tariff beyond 2005 was compatible with eu legislation and potentially distorted competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs 

on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and therefore the italian government is to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest the amount of this recovery was to be based on a calculation prepared by the italian government see below in late 2009 after discussions with legal counsel and reviewing the bases on which the ec decided including the different considerations cited in the ec decision regarding alcoa’s two smelters in italy alcoa recorded a charge of 250 million €173 million which included 20 million €14 million to 

  

write off a receivable from the italian government for amounts due under the now expired tariff structure and 230 million €159 million to establish a reserve on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal of this decision with the general court of the eu alcoa will pursue all substantive and procedural legal steps available to annul the ec’s decision prior to 2012 alcoa was involved in other legal proceedings related to this matter that sought the annulment of the ec’s july 2006 decision to open an investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules and requested injunctive relief to suspend the effectiveness of the ec’s november 19 2009 decision however the decisions by the general court and subsequent appeals to the european court of justice resulted in the denial of these remedies 

in june 2012 alcoa received formal notification from the italian government with a calculated recovery amount of 375 million €303 million this amount was reduced by 65 million €53 million for amounts owed by the italian government to alcoa resulting in a net payment request of 310 million €250 million in a notice published in the official journal of the european union on september 22 2012 the ec announced that it had filed an action against the italian government on july 18 2012 to compel it to collect the recovery amount and on october 17 2013 the ecj ordered italy to so collect on september 27 2012 alcoa received a request for payment in full of the 310 million €250 million by october 31 2012 following discussions with the italian government regarding the timing of such payment alcoa paid the requested amount in five quarterly installments of 69 million €50 million beginning in october 2012 through december 2013 notwithstanding the payment request alcoa’s estimate of the most probable loss of the ultimate outcome of this matter and the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss which is 219 million €159 million to 418 million €303 million remains the 219 million €159 million the us dollar amount reflects the effects of foreign currency movements since 2009 recorded in 2009 at december 31 2013 alcoa no longer has a reserve for this matter instead alcoa has a noncurrent asset of 126 million €91 million reflecting the excess of the total of the five payments made to the italian government over the reserve alcoa recorded in 2009 the full extent of the loss will not be known until the final judicial determination which could be a period of several years 

as previously reported in january 2007 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules at the time the ec opened its investigation alcoa had been operating in spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies the investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the ec with respect to the energyintensive consumers the ec opened the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than a pool price mechanism therefore being in principle artificially below market conditions alcoa submitted comments in which the company provided evidence that prices paid by energyintensive consumers were in line with the market in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in the tariff system while alcoa does not believe that an unfavorable decision is probable management has estimated that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision could be approximately 95 million €70 million pretax also while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005 it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts on february 4 2014 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the electricity tariffs granted by spain for year 2005 do not constitute unlawful state aid 

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites the most significant of these matters including the remediation of the grasse river in massena ny are discussed in the environmental matters section of note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on pages 122126 

  

as previously reported in august 2005 dany lavoie a resident of baie comeau in the canadian province of québec filed a motion for authorization to institute a class action and for designation of a class representative against alcoa canada ltd alcoa limitée societe canadienne de metaux reynolds limitée and canadian british aluminum in the superior court of québec in the district of baie comeau plaintiff seeks to institute the class action on behalf of a putative class consisting of all past present and future owners tenants and residents of baie comeau’s st georges neighborhood he alleges that defendants as the present and past owners and operators of an aluminum smelter in baie comeau have negligently allowed the emission of certain contaminants from the smelter specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or “pahs” that have been deposited on the lands and houses of the st georges neighborhood and its environs causing damage to the property of the putative class and causing health concerns for those who inhabit that neighborhood plaintiff originally moved to certify a class action sought to compel additional remediation to be conducted by the defendants beyond that already undertaken by them voluntarily sought an injunction against further emissions in excess of a limit to be determined by the court in consultation with an independent expert and sought money damages on behalf of all class members in may 2007 the court authorized a class action suit to include only people who suffered property damage or personal injury damages caused by the emission of pahs from the smelter in september 2007 plaintiffs filed the claim against the original defendants which the court had authorized in may alcoa has filed its statement of defense and plaintiffs filed an answer to that statement alcoa also filed a motion for particulars with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiffs’ answer and a motion to strike with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiffs’ answer in late 2010 the court denied these motions the soderberg smelting process that plaintiffs allege to be the source of emissions of concern have ceased operations and are being dismantled no further formal court proceedings or discovery has occurred while technical advisors nominated by agreement of the parties confer on potential health impacts of prior emissions this protocol has been agreed to by the parties who have also advised the court regarding the process the plaintiffs have not quantified the damages sought without such amount and given the various damages alleged at this stage of the proceeding the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

as previously reported in january 2006 in musgrave v alcoa et al warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601ct0006 alcoa inc and a subsidiary were sued by an individual on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated claiming harm from alleged exposure to waste that had been disposed in designated pits at the squaw creek mine in the 1970s during february 2007 class allegations were dropped and the matter proceeded as an individual claim alcoa filed a renewed motion to dismiss arguing that the claims are barred by the indiana workers’ compensation act amended its answer to include indiana’s recreational use statute as an affirmative defense and filed a motion for summary judgment based on the recreational use statute the court granted alcoa’s motion to dismiss regarding plaintiffs’ occupationallyrelated claims and denied the motion regarding plaintiffs’ recreationallyrelated claims on january 17 2012 the court denied all outstanding motions with no opinion issued a jury trial commenced on april 10 2012 and on may 1 2012 the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants alcoa inc and its subsidiary the court entered its judgment on may 14 2012 on may 31 2012 plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on august 6 2013 the indiana court of appeals issued a unanimous opinion affirming the jury verdict in favor of alcoa the court of appeals also affirmed the trial court’s pretrial ruling dismissing mr musgrave’s workrelated exposure claims as barred by indiana’s workers’ compensation act the musgraves’ petition for rehearing filed on september 5 2013 was denied by the court of appeals on october 16 2013 on november 14 2013 plaintiffs filed a petition for review at the indiana supreme court a decision on allowing the appeal has not been rendered 

also as previously reported in october 2006 in barnett et al v alcoa and alcoa fuels inc warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601pl499 fortyone plaintiffs sued alcoa inc and a subsidiary asserting claims similar to the musgrave matter discussed above in november 2007 alcoa inc and its subsidiary filed motions to dismiss both the musgrave and barnett cases in october 2008 the warrick county circuit court granted alcoa’s motions to dismiss dismissing all claims arising out of alleged occupational exposure to wastes at the squaw creek mine but in november 2008 the trial court clarified its ruling indicating that the order does not dispose of plaintiffs’ personal injury claims based upon alleged “recreational” or nonoccupational exposure plaintiffs also filed a “second amended complaint” in response to the court’s orders granting alcoa’s motions to dismiss on july 7 2010 the court granted the parties’ joint motions for a general continuance of trial settings discovery in this matter is stayed pending 

  

the outcome of the musgrave matter the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss because plaintiffs have merely alleged that their medical condition is attributable to exposure to materials at the squaw creek mine but no further information is available due to the discovery stay 

as previously reported in 1996 alcoa acquired the fusina italy smelter and rolling operations and the portovesme italy smelter both of which are owned by alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl from alumix an entity owned by the italian government alcoa also acquired the extrusion plants located in feltre and bolzano italy at the time of the acquisition alumix indemnified alcoa for preexisting environmental contamination at the sites in 2004 the italian ministry of environment moe issued orders to alcoa trasformazioni srl and alumix for the development of a cleanup plan related to soil contamination in excess of allowable limits under legislative decree and to institute emergency actions and pay natural resource damages on april 5 2006 alcoa trasformazioni srl’s fusina site was also sued by the moe and minister of public works mopw in the civil court of venice for an alleged liability for environmental damages in parallel with the orders already issued by the moe alcoa trasformazioni srl appealed the orders defended the civil case for environmental damages which is still pending and filed suit against alumix as discussed below similar issues also existed with respect to the bolzano and feltre plants based on orders issued by local authorities in 2006 all the orders have been challenged in front of the administrative regional courts and all trials are still pending however in bolzano the municipality of bolzano withdrew the order and the regional administrative tribunal of veneto suspended the order in feltre most if not all of the underlying activities occurred during the ownership of alumix the governmental entity that sold the italian plants to alcoa 

as noted above in response to the 2006 civil suit by the moe and mopw alcoa trasformazioni srl filed suit against alumix claiming indemnification under the original acquisition agreement but brought that suit in the court of rome due to jurisdictional rules the court of rome has appointed an expert to assess the causes of the pollution in june 2008 the parties alcoa and now ligestra srl ligestra the successor to alumix signed a preliminary agreement by which they have committed to pursue a settlement and asked for a suspension of the technical assessment during the negotiations the court of rome accepted the request and postponed the technical assessment reserving its ability to fix the deadline depending on the development of negotiations alcoa and ligestra agreed to a settlement in december 2008 with respect to the feltre site ligestra paid the sum of 108 million euros and alcoa committed to clean up the site further postponements were granted by the court of rome and the next hearing is fixed for april 22 2014 in the meantime alcoa trasformazioni srl and ligestra reached a preliminary agreement for settlement of the liabilities related to fusina allocating 80 and 20 of the remediation costs to ligestra and alcoa respectively in january 2014 a final agreement with ligestra was signed and on february 5 2014 alcoa signed a final agreement with the moe and mopw settling all environmental issues at the fusina site as set out in the agreement between alcoa and ligestra those two parties will share the remediation costs and environmental damages claimed by the moe and mopw the remediation project filed by alcoa and ligestra has been approved by the moe to provide time for settlement with ligestra the moe and alcoa jointly requested and the civil court of venice has granted a series of postponements of hearings in the venice trial assuming that the case will be closed the next hearing is fixed for march 28 2014 when the case will be closed 

alcoa and ligestra have signed a similar agreement relating to the portovesme site however that agreement is contingent upon final acceptance of the proposed soil remediation project for portovesme that was rejected by the moe in the fourth quarter of 2013 alcoa intends to submit a revised proposal in 2014 alcoa is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss beyond what is described in footnote n to the consolidated financial statements for several reasons first the moe has approved the remediation plan for fusina only and certain costs relating to the remediation are not yet fixed in connection with the proposed plan for portovesme the company understands that the moe has substantial discretion in defining what must be managed under the italian soils law the availability of appropriate landfills must also be considered as well as the nature of these sites as a result the scope and cost of the final remediation plan remain uncertain for portovesme in addition even though the plan was rejected by the moe and the settlement with ligestra relating to portovesme has become void alcoa should be held responsible only for its share of pollution however the area is impacted by many sources of pollution as well as historical pollution consequently the allocation of liabilities would need a very complex technical evaluation by the authorities that has not yet been performed 

  

as previously reported on november 30 2010 alumínio received service of a lawsuit that had been filed by the public prosecutors of the state of pará in brazil in november 2009 the suit names the company and the state of pará which through its environmental agency had issued the operating license for the company’s new bauxite mine in juruti the suit concerns the impact of the project on the region’s water system and alleges that certain conditions of the original installation license were not met by the company in the lawsuit plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction suspending the operating license and ordering payment of compensation on april 14 2010 the court denied plaintiffs’ request alumínio presented its defense in march 2011 on grounds that it was in compliance with the terms and conditions of its operating license which included plans to mitigate the impact of the project on the region’s water system in april 2011 the state of pará defended itself in the case asserting that the operating license contains the necessary plans to mitigate such impact that the state monitors the performance of aluminio’s obligations arising out of such license that the licensing process is valid and legal and that the suit is meritless the company’s position is that any impact from the project had been fully repaired when the suit was filed the company also believes that jará lake has not been affected by any project activity and any evidence of pollution from the project would be unreliable following the preliminary injunction the plaintiffs have taken no further action the company is not certain whether or when the action will proceed given that this proceeding is in its preliminary stage and the current uncertainty in this case the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss

other contingencies 

in addition to the matters discussed above various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against alcoa including those pertaining to environmental product liability safety and health and tax matters while the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that the company’s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on the financial position of the company

management review of 2013 and outlook for the future 

in 2013 growth in global aluminum demand reached 7 which was consistent with management’s projection at the end of 2012 however lme pricing levels declined on average 9 yearoveryear the continued weakness in the primary aluminum market led management to review existing high cost capacity for potential curtailment or shut down resulting in 277 kmt of capacity taken offline in 2013 with another potential 183 kmt to be removed in 2014 additionally from a nonoperational perspective the outlook for the smelting operations led to two significant unusual noncash negative impacts to alcoa’s results related to the impairment of goodwill and the potential future realizability of certain deferred tax assets the company was able to more than offset cost headwinds with continued net productivity improvements across all operations additionally the midstream and downstream operations continue to grow revenue through share gains and innovation while generating significant profits for the company management continued its focus on liquidity and cash flows generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies overhead rationalization working capital and disciplined capital spending these actions enabled alcoa to decrease debt while maintaining a stable level of cash on hand resulting in a strengthened balance sheet 

the following financial information reflects some key measures of alcoa’s 2013 results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2014 management is projecting continued growth increase of 7 in the global consumption of primary aluminum consistent with that of the last two years all regions except europe are expected to have threetoeight percent increases in aluminum demand over 2013 with china 10 expected to have the highest growth rate in 2014 after considering forecasted added production along with few industrywide capacity curtailments management anticipates a balanced aluminum market for alumina growth in global consumption is estimated to be 9 and supply is expected to slightly exceed overall demand due to new capacity in australia saudi arabia and india combined with added production in china 

management also anticipates improved market conditions for valueadd products in the aerospace building and construction packaging and automotive global end markets despite declines in certain regions aerospace is expected to be driven by large commercial aircraft as well as strength in regional and business jets as it relates to building and 

  

construction awarded nonresidential contracts are up in north america while the decline in europe is slowing down the packaging market continues to see a conversion from steel cans to aluminum cans for existing products and the emergence of new products is increasing for automotive growth continues in both the us as automakers strive to meet stricter emissions regulations and china due to a higher percentage of the population driving automobiles conversely management expects a decline in the industrial gas turbine global end market due to pressure from low price coal in europe and rising gas prices in the us in the commercial transportation global end market growth in the us as orders and backlog have increased significantly is expected to be offset by declines in europe due to regulatory change in emissions requirements 

on a companywide basis management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2014 

 

  

  

 looking ahead over the next one to three years management will focus on new strategic targets that build on the ones established three years ago previously these targets included lowering alcoa’s refining and smelting operations on the cost curve to the 23rd from 30th and 41st from 51st percentiles respectively by 2015 and driving revenue growth while improving margins that exceed historical levels in the midstream increase of 2500 and downstream increase of 1600 operations by 2013 management made significant progress on the 2010 targets as described below 

at december 31 2013 alcoa’s refining operations were in the 27th percentile a threepercentage point improvement and smelting operations were in the 43rd percentile an eightpercentage point improvement on the respective cost curves in 2013 actions taken to improve alcoa’s position on the cost curve for both refining and smelting operations included productivity improvements which encompassed new initiatives as well as the full capitalization of initiatives implemented in 2012 additionally for the smelting operations management initiated a permanent shutdown of 146 kmt of capacity in canada and the us combined and a temporary curtailment of 131 kmt of capacity in brazil virtually all of which was completed during the second half of 2013 these decisions were based on a 460 kmt smelting capacity review initiated by management in may 2013 the review of the remaining 183 kmt is expected to be completed in the first half of 2014 see primary metals in segment information below 

the new targets for the refining and smelting operations are to further extend the 2015 target reductions on the cost curve by an additional twopercentage points and threepercentage points respectively by 2016 resulting in attaining the 21st percentile and 38th percentile respectively the full operation of the smelter and the refinery at the joint venture in saudi arabia is expected to provide a twopercentage point reduction on each of the respective cost curves additionally initiatives to drive further productivity improvements will continue 

the new targets for the midstream and downstream operations are to increase revenue while improving margins that meet or exceed historical levels by 1000 and 1200 respectively by 2016 of which 90 and 75 respectively is expected to be generated from innovation and share gains a portion of the revenue increase for the midstream operations is expected to be generated from the expansion of the rolling facilities in both davenport ia beginning in 2014 and in tennessee beginning in 2015 to meet rising us automotive demand due to changing emission regulations and the construction of the rolling mill as part of a joint venture in saudi arabia began in december 2013 additional automotive capacity by the end of 2014 for the downstream operations the expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in lafayette in beginning end of 2014 to meet the growing demand in the aerospace market is expected to contribute to the increase in revenue 

  

results of operations 

earnings summary 

loss from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2013 was 2285 or 214 per diluted share compared with income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa of 191 or 018 per share in 2012 the decrease of 2476 in the results from continuing operations was mostly due to an impairment of goodwill a discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets and charges for the resolution of a legal matter other significant changes in the results from continuing operations included the following lower realized prices for aluminum in the upstream and midstream businesses higher input costs across three of the four segments the absence of a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets and restructuring and other charges related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity these other changes were mostly offset by net productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements the absence of both a net charge for certain environmental remediation matters and a charge for the civil portion of a legal matter and stronger volumes in three of the four segments 

income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2012 was 191 or 018 per share compared with 614 or 055 per share in 2011 the decline of 423 in the results from continuing operations was primarily due to the following lower realized prices for aluminum and alumina higher input costs and charges for the civil portion of a legal matter and certain environmental remediation matters these items were partially offset by net productivity improvements a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets a decline in the results attributable to noncontrolling interests lower restructuring charges net favorable foreign currency movements lower income taxes due to a decline in operating results a favorable lifo last in first out impact and higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments 

net loss attributable to alcoa for 2013 was 2285 or 214 per share compared with net income attributable to alcoa of 191 or 018 per share in 2012 and net income attributable to alcoa of 611 or 055 per share in 2011 in 2011 net income of 611 included a loss from discontinued operations of 3 see loss from discontinued operations below 

sales— sales for 2013 were 23032 compared with sales of 23700 in 2012 a decline of 668 or 3 the decrease was primarily due to lower primary aluminum volumes including those related to curtailed and shutdown smelter capacity a decline in realized prices for aluminum driven by lower london metal exchange lme prices and unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices somewhat offset by higher volumes in the alumina midstream and downstream segments 

sales for 2012 were 23700 compared with sales of 24951 in 2011 a decrease of 1251 or 5 the decline was mainly the result of a drop in realized prices for aluminum and alumina driven by lower lme prices unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices and unfavorable foreign currency movements mostly due to a weaker euro somewhat offset by higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments and favorable product mix in the midstream segment 

cost of goods sold— cogs as a percentage of sales was 837 in 2013 compared with 861 in 2012 the percentage was positively impacted by net productivity improvements across all segments the absence of a net charge for five environmental remediation matters 194 net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and a positive impact related to the march 2012 fire at the cast house in massena ny insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012 these items were partially offset by the previously mentioned realized price impacts and higher input costs including those related to bauxite mining and planned maintenance outages at various power plants 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 861 in 2012 compared with 821 in 2011 the percentage was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower realized prices in the upstream and midstream segments higher input costs and a net charge for five environmental remediation matters 194 these items were somewhat offset by net 

  

productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and a change in lifo adjustments from unfavorable to favorable primarily due to lower prices for alumina and metal and lower costs for calcined coke 

selling general administrative and other expenses— sga expenses were 1008 or 44 of sales in 2013 compared with 997 or 42 of sales in 2012 the increase of 11 was principally the result of higher labor costs partially offset by a decrease in professional expenses and contract services and lower bad debt expense 

sga expenses were 997 or 42 of sales in 2012 compared with 1027 or 41 of sales in 2011 the decline of 30 was mostly due to lower stockbased compensation expense a decrease in bad debt expense due to the absence of charges for anticipated customer credit losses primarily related to those in europe a decline in travel expense and less spending across various other expenses these items were partially offset by higher pension costs due to the recognition of higher net actuarial losses and increased professional expenses due to consulting fees associated with productivity initiatives and higher legal expenses 

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 192 in 2013 compared with 197 in 2012 and 184 in 2011 the decrease in 2013 as compared to 2012 was mainly driven by lower spending related to inert anode and carbothermic technology for the primary metals segment and other various projects mostly offset by new spending related to an upgrade of a micromill™ in san antonio tx for the global rolled products segment this upgrade is expected to be completed by the end of 2015 and as a result the micromill™ will develop and qualify aluminum products for the automotive and packaging end markets the increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily caused by additional spending related to inert anode technology for the primary metals segment 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1421 in 2013 compared with 1460 in 2012 the decrease of 39 or 3 was mostly due to net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar particularly against the australian dollar and brazilian real a reduction in expense related to the permanent shutdown of smelter capacity in canada the us and italy that occurred mid 2013 and the absence of expense due to the divestiture of us hydroelectric power assets in late 2012 these declines were slightly offset by new depreciation associated with a hydroelectric power project in brazil machadinho in early 2013 there was a change in the legal structure of the entity that owned the project resulting in alcoa recording its 3099 share of the project’s assets directly whereas in 2012 alcoa’s share was recorded as an equity method investment 

the provision for dda was 1460 in 2012 compared with 1479 in 2011 the decrease of 19 or 1 was principally the result of the cessation of dda due to the decision at the end of 2011 to permanently shut down and demolish the smelter in tennessee see restructuring and other charges below and the absence of dda on various inuse assets that reached the end of their estimated useful life in 2011 these declines were partially offset by an increase related to assets placed into service associated with a new hydroelectric power project in brazil estreito and higher dda due to the capitalization of new haul roads and the writeoff of old haul roads no longer in use for mining sites in australia 

impairment of goodwill— in 2013 alcoa recognized an impairment of goodwill in the amount of 1731 1719 after noncontrolling interest related to the annual impairment review of the primary metals segment see goodwill in critical accounting policies and estimates below 

  

restructuring and other charges— restructuring and other charges for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2013 were comprised of the following 

 

 layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 

2013 actions in 2013 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 782 585 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 391 305 aftertax and noncontrolling interest related to a legal matter 245 183 aftertax for exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain structures at three smelter locations see below 87 61 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for layoff costs including the separation of approximately 1110 employees 340 in the primary metals segment 260 in the engineered products and solutions segment 250 in the global rolled products segment 85 in the alumina segment and 175 in corporate of which 590 relates to a global overhead reduction program and 9 in pension plan settlement charges related to previously separated employees 25 17 aftertax in net charges including 12 8 aftertax for asset impairments related to retirements andor the sale of previously idled structures 25 13 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for asset impairments related to the writeoff of capitalized costs for projects no longer being pursued due to the market environment a net charge of 17 12 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other miscellaneous items including 3 2 aftertax for asset impairments and 8 6 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of a number of small layoff reserves related to prior periods 

in may 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of i two potlines capacity of 105 kmtperyear that utilize soderberg technology at the smelter located in baie comeau québec canada remaining capacity of 280 kmtperyear composed of two prebake potlines and ii the smelter located in fusina italy capacity of 44 kmtperyear additionally in august 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline capacity of 41 kmtperyear that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east ny smelter remaining capacity of 84 kmtperyear composed of two soderberg potlines – see primary metals in segment information below the aforementioned soderberg lines at baie comeau and massena east were fully shut down by the end of september 2013 while the fusina smelter was previously temporarily idled in 2010 demolition and remediation activities related to all three facilities began in late 2013 and are expected to be completed by the end of 2014 massena east 2015 baie comeau and 2017 fusina 

the decisions on the soderberg lines for baie comeau and massena east are part of a 15month review of 460 kmt of smelting capacity initiated by management in may 2013 for possible curtailment while the decision on the fusina smelter is in addition to the capacity being reviewed factors leading to all three decisions were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution italy changed market fundamentals other existing idle capacity and restart costs the remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity subject to this review is expected to be completed during the first half of 2014 see primary metals in segment information below as such future restructuring charges may be recognized if the decision to shut down more capacity is made in 2014 

in 2013 exit costs related to these actions included 114 for the layoff of approximately 550 employees primary metals segment including 83 in pension costs accelerated depreciation of 58 baie comeau and asset impairments 

  

of 18 fusina and massena east representing the writeoff of the remaining book value of all related properties plants and equipment and 55 in other exit costs additionally in 2013 remaining inventories mostly operating supplies and raw materials were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 9 6 aftertax which was recorded in cost of goods sold on the statement of consolidated operations the other exit costs of 55 represent 48 in asset retirement obligations and 5 in environmental remediation both triggered by the decisions to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 2 in other related costs 

as of december 31 2013 approximately 1020 of the 1660 employees were separated the remaining separations for the 2013 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2014 in 2013 cash payments of 33 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2013 restructuring programs 

2012 actions in 2012 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 172 106 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 85 33 aftertax and noncontrolling interest related to the civil portion of a legal matter 47 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 800 employees 390 in the engineered products and solutions segment 250 in the primary metals segment 85 in the alumina segment and 75 in corporate including 10 7 aftertax for the layoff of an additional 170 employees related to the previously reported smelter curtailments in spain see 2011 actions below 30 30 aftertax in asset impairments and 6 6 aftertax for lease and contract termination costs due to a decision to exit the lithographic sheet business in bohai china 11 11 aftertax in costs to idle the portovesme smelter see 2011 actions below 10 8 aftertax in other asset impairments a net charge of 4 4 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other miscellaneous items and 21 15 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods including 10 7 aftertax related to the smelters in spain the reversal related to the smelters in spain is due to lower than expected costs based on agreements with employee representatives and the government as well as a reduction of 55 in the number of layoffs due to the anticipation of the restart of a portion of the previously curtailed capacity based on an agreement with the spanish government that will provide interruptibility rights ie compensation for power interruptions when grids are overloaded to the smelters during 2013 a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded at the end of 2011 see 2011 actions below and a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded during 2012 see above 

as of december 31 2013 the separations associated with 2012 restructuring programs were essentially complete in 2013 and 2012 cash payments of 17 and 16 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to the 2012 restructuring programs 

2011 actions in 2011 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 281 181 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 127 82 aftertax in asset impairments and 36 23 aftertax in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at two us locations see below 93 68 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 1600 employees 820 in the primary metals segment 470 in the global rolled products segment 160 in the alumina segment 20 in the engineered products and solutions segment and 130 in corporate including the effects of planned smelter curtailments see below 23 12 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other asset impairments including the writeoff of the carrying value of an idled structure in australia that processed spent pot lining and adjustments to the fair value of the one remaining foil location while it was classified as held for sale due to foreign currency movements 20 8 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for a litigation matter related to the former st croix location a net charge of 5 4 aftertax for other miscellaneous items and 23 16 aftertax for the reversal of previously recorded layoff reserves due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances including a change in plans for alcoa’s aluminum powder facility in rockdale tx 

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two us locations each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons the identified facilities are the smelter located in alcoa tn capacity of 215 kmtperyear and two potlines capacity of 76 kmtperyear at the smelter located in rockdale tx remaining capacity of 191 kmtperyear composed of four potlines demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in 2012 and are expected to be completed in 2015 for the tennessee smelter 

  

and in 2013 for the two potlines at the rockdale smelter essentially complete at december 31 2013 this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs the asset impairments of 127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties plants and equipment related to these facilities additionally remaining inventories mostly operating supplies were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 6 4 aftertax which was recorded in cost of goods sold on the statement of consolidated operations the other exit costs of 36 represent 18 11 aftertax in environmental remediation and 17 11 aftertax in asset retirement obligations both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 1 1 aftertax in other related costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme italy 150 kmtperyear avilés spain 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña spain 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear these curtailments were completed by the end of 2012 the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility which would result in future charges while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 as a result of these decisions alcoa recorded costs of 33 31 aftertax for the layoff of approximately 650 employees as alcoa engaged in discussions with the respective employee representatives and governments additional charges were recognized in 2012 see 2012 actions above 

as of december 31 2013 the separations associated with 2011 restructuring programs were essentially complete in 2013 and 2012 cash payments of 11 and 23 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to the 2011 restructuring programs 

alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense— interest expense was 453 in 2013 compared with 490 in 2012 the decrease of 37 or 8 was primarily due to a 7 lower average debt level which was mostly attributable to lower outstanding longterm debt due to the june 2013 repayment of 422 in 600 notes and payments associated with the loans supporting growth projects in brazil 

interest expense was 490 in 2012 compared with 524 in 2011 the decline of 34 or 6 was principally caused by the absence of a 41 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes 74 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a 33 gain for “inthemoney” interest rate swaps somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest 8 the decrease in capitalized interest was largely attributable to the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil as construction was nearly complete partially offset by an increase related to the aluminum complex in saudi arabia 

other income net— other income net was 25 in 2013 compared with 341 in 2012 the change of 316 was mainly the result of the absence of a 320 gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets see below also a higher 

  

equity loss 40 related to alcoa’s share of the joint venture in saudi arabia due to startup costs and a shutdown of one of the two smelter potlines due to a period of instability was partially offset by net favorable foreign currency movements 28 

other income net was 341 in 2012 compared with 87 in 2011 the increase of 254 was mostly due to a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets 320 see primary metals in segment information below and net favorable foreign currency movements 21 these two items were somewhat offset by lower equity income 43 largely attributable to alcoa’s share of expenses of the joint venture in saudi arabia and the absence of a discrete income tax benefit recognized by the consortium related to an investment in a natural gas pipeline in australia alcoa world alumina and chemicals’ share of the benefit was 24 the absence of a gain on the sale of land in australia 43 and a net unfavorable change in marktomarket derivative contracts 39 principally driven by the absence of a favorable change in an energy contract that expired in september 2011 

income taxes— alcoa’s effective tax rate was 236 in 2013 provision on a loss compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs by 586 points from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a 1731 impairment of goodwill see impairment of goodwill above and a 209 charge for a legal matter see restructuring and other charges above that are nondeductible for income tax purposes a 372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the us see income taxes in critical accounting policies and estimates below restructuring charges related to operations in canada benefit at a lower tax rate and italy no tax benefit see restructuring and other charges above and a 9 discrete income tax charge related to prior year taxes in spain and australia these items were slightly offset by an 18 discrete income tax benefit related to new us tax legislation 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions through 2013 two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted alcoa are the lookthrough rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit the expiration of these two provisions resulted in alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of 18 in 2012 as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment alcoa recognized the previously mentioned discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions for tax years beginning after december 31 2013 these two provisions once again expire absent a retroactive extension enacted in 2014 alcoa would recognize a higher income tax provision of 5 in 2014 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 500 provision on income in 2012 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax impact from the gain recognized on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets see primary metals in segment information below and an 8 discrete income tax charge related to prior year us taxes on certain depletable assets slightly offset by a 13 discrete income tax benefit related to a change in the legal structure of an investment 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 240 provision on income in 2011 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate mainly due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2014 will be approximately 45 however changes in the current economic environment tax legislation or rate changes currency fluctuations ability to realize deferred tax assets and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 

in december 2011 one of the company’s subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations during 2013 the application was amended and refiled and separately a similar application was filed for another one of the company’s subsidiaries in brazil if approved the tax rate for these subsidiaries will decrease significantly resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10year holiday period would be retroactively effective as of january 1 2013 additionally the net deferred tax asset of one of the subsidiaries would be remeasured 

  

at the lower rate in the period the holiday is approved the net deferred tax asset of the other subsidiary would not be remeasured since it could still be utilized against future earnings of the subsidiary not subject to the tax holiday this remeasurement would result in a decrease to that subsidiary’s net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of approximately 50 as of december 31 2013 alcoa’s subsidiaries’ applications are still pending 

noncontrolling interests— net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 41 in 2013 compared with net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 29 in 2012 the change of 70 was primarily due to the results of alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac which is owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited in 2013 the change in awac’s results was impacted by improved operating results and items related to a legal matter the increase in awac’s operating results was principally driven by net favorable foreign currency movements and net productivity improvements somewhat offset by an increase in input costs completely offsetting the improved operating results of awac was the difference between a 384 charge for a legal matter in 2013 and an 85 charge related to the civil portion of the same legal matter in 2012 a description of how these charges for this legal matter impacted noncontrolling interests follows 

the noncontrolling interest’s share of awac’s charge for a legal matter in 2013 and 2012 was 58 and 34 respectively in 2012 the 34 was based on the 40 ownership interest of alumina limited while in 2013 the 58 was based on 15 the application of a different percentage was due to the criteria in a 2012 allocation agreement between alcoa and alumina limited related to this legal matter being met additionally the 34 charge as well as costs related to this legal matter was retroactively adjusted to reflect the terms of the allocation agreement resulting in a credit to noncontrolling interests of 41 in summary noncontrolling interests included a charge of 17 and 34 related to this legal matter in 2013 and 2012 respectively 

net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was 29 in 2012 compared with net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 194 in 2011 the change of 223 was mostly due to lower earnings of awac the decline in awac’s earnings was attributed primarily to lower realized prices due to a decrease in contractual lmebased pricing higher input costs particularly caustic and fuel oil and an 85 charge for the civil portion of a legal matter 34 is noncontrolling interest’s share these items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar 

loss from discontinued operations— loss from discontinued operations in 2011 was 3 comprised of an additional loss of 3 5 pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion divested in june 2009 of the electrical and electronic solutions ees business as a result of a negotiated preliminary settlement related to claims filed in 2010 against alcoa by platinum equity in an insolvency proceeding in germany a net gain of 2 3 pretax related to both the wire harness and electrical portion and the electronics portion divested in december 2009 of the ees business for a number of small postclosing and other adjustments and a 2 2 pretax reversal of the gain recognized in 2006 related to the sale of the home exteriors business for an adjustment to an outstanding obligation which was part of the terms of sale 

segment information 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals global rolled products and engineered products and solutions segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges discontinued operations and other items including intersegment profit eliminations differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 

  

on january 1 2013 management revised the inventorycosting method used by certain locations within the global rolled products and engineered products and solutions segments which affects the determination of the respective segment’s profitability measure atoi management made the change in order to improve internal consistency and enhance industry comparability this revision does not impact the consolidated results of alcoa segment information for all prior periods presented was revised to reflect this change 

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 1217 in 2013 1357 in 2012 and 1885 in 2011 see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information the following discussion provides shipments sales and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2013 

alumina 

 

  this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide refinery system including the mining of bauxite which is then refined into alumina alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products a portion of this segment’s thirdparty sales are completed through the use of agents alumina traders and distributors slightly more than half of alcoa’s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment 

in 2013 alumina production increased by 276 kmt compared to 2012 the improvement was mostly the result of higher production in the atlantic refinery system primarily at the point comfort tx refinery 

in 2012 alumina production decreased by 144 kmt compared to 2011 the decline was mainly driven by lower production in the atlantic refinery system as a result of management’s plan to reduce annual production capacity by approximately 390 kmt this decision was made to align production with smelter curtailments initiated at the beginning of 2012 and to reflect prevailing market conditions the decrease at these refineries was partially offset by higher production at the pinjarra and kwinana refineries in australia due to system process improvements 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment improved 8 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely attributable to an increase of 7 in volume and positive impacts from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and spot pricing somewhat offset by a decrease in contractual lmebased pricing fewer sales subject to lme pricing and lower average lme prices for those sales subject to lme pricing 

thirdparty sales for this segment dropped 11 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily related to a 12 decline in realized prices driven by a decrease in contractual lmebased pricing slightly offset by realized benefits from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and from improved spot pricing 

  

intersegment sales for the alumina segment declined 3 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily the result of lower demand from the primary metals segment intersegment sales for this segment decreased 15 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to lower realized prices and decreased demand from the primary metals segment 

atoi for the alumina segment increased 169 in 2013 compared with 2012 mainly caused by net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar especially against the australian dollar and net productivity improvements these positive impacts were somewhat offset by cost increases for bauxite due to a new mining site in suriname and a crusher equipment move in australia rising natural gas prices in australia and higher maintenance costs in australia and latin america 

atoi for this segment dropped 517 in 2012 compared with 2011 mostly due to the previously mentioned lower realized prices higher input costs particularly caustic and fuel oil and the absence of a gain on the sale of land in australia 30 these negative impacts were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar especially against the brazilian real 

in 2014 the continued shift towards alumina index and spotpricing is expected to average 65 of thirdparty shipments also a higher equity loss related to preoperational rampup activities at the refinery in saudi arabia and overall higher energy prices in this segment’s refinery system are expected 

primary metals 

 

  this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide smelter system primary metals receives alumina mostly from the alumina segment and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa’s fabricating businesses as well as sold to external customers and traders results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess power are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buyresell activity primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales buyresell activity occurs when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 

in november 2012 alcoa completed the sale of its 351megawatt tapoco hydroelectric project “tapoco” to brookfield renewable energy partners for 597 in cash alcoa recognized a gain of 320 173 aftertax in other income net on the statement of consolidated operations of which a gain of 426 275 aftertax was reflected in the primary metals segment and a loss of 106 102 aftertax was reflected in corporate the amount in corporate represents the writeoff of goodwill and capitalized interest related to tapoco that were not included in the assets of the primary metals segment tapoco is a fourstation hydroelectric project located on the little tennessee and cheoah rivers in eastern tennessee and western north carolina the transaction included four generating stations and dams 86 miles of transmission lines and approximately 14500 acres of land associated with and surrounding tapoco the power generated by tapoco was 

  

primarily consumed by alcoa’s smelter in tennessee which was temporarily idled in 2009 and permanently shut down in 2011 since 2009 the power generated from tapoco was sold into the open market 

at december 31 2013 alcoa had 655 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4037 kmt in 2013 idle capacity increased 64 kmt compared to 2012 mostly due to the temporary curtailment of 131 kmt combined at two smelters in brazil partially offset by the permanent closure of the fusina smelter in italy 44 kmtperyear and the restart of a portion 27 kmt combined of the capacity that was temporary curtailed in 2012 related to the avilés and la coruña smelters in spain base capacity declined 190 kmt between december 31 2013 and 2012 due to the permanent closure of three potlines combined at smelters in canada and in the us and the previously mentioned permanent shutdown of the fusina smelter a detailed description of each of these actions follows 

the restarts in spain occurred in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime in the spanish power market in december 2012 the spanish government issued a ministerial order that modified the interruptibility regime previously in place in the spanish power market the interruptibility regime allows certain industrial customers who are willing to be subject to temporary interruptions in the supply of power to sell interruption rights to the high voltage transmission system operator in january 2013 alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell interruption services under the modified regime from its san ciprian avilés and la coruña smelters in spain the commitment is taken for a oneyear period which has since been extended until october 2014 in 2013 the spanish government notified the european commission of the modification in the interruptibility regime for review under european state aid rules 

in may 2013 alcoa announced that management will review 460 kmt of smelting capacity over a 15month period for possible curtailment this review is aimed at maintaining alcoa’s competitiveness despite falling aluminum prices and will focus on the highestcost smelting capacity and those plants that have longterm risk due to factors such as energy costs or regulatory uncertainty 

as part of this review also in may 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of two potlines 105 kmtperyear that utilize soderberg technology at the baie comeau smelter in quebec canada additionally in august 2013 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of one potline 41 kmtperyear that utilizes soderberg technology at the massena east ny plant the shutdown of these three lines was completed by the end of september 2013 the baie comeau smelter has a remaining capacity of 280 kmtperyear composed of two prebake potlines and the massena east smelter has a remaining capacity of 84 kmtperyear composed of two soderberg potlines 

also in august 2013 as part of this review management initiated the temporary curtailment of 97 kmt at the são luís smelter and 31 kmt at the poços de caldas smelter both in brazil this action was also completed by the end of september 2013 an additional 3 kmt was temporarily curtailed at the poços de caldas smelter by the end of 2013 

the remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity subject to this review is expected to be completed during the first half of 2014 see 2014 outlook below 

in june 2013 management decided to permanently close the fusina smelter as the underlying conditions that led to the idling of the smelter in 2010 have not fundamentally changed including low aluminum prices and the lack of an economically viable longterm power solution 

at december 31 2012 alcoa had 591 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4227 kmt in 2012 idle capacity decreased 53 kmt compared to 2011 due to the permanent shutdown of the smelter in tennessee 215 kmtperyear and two potlines at the smelter located in rockdale tx 76 kmtperyear mostly offset by the curtailment of the portovesme smelter in italy 150 kmtperyear and the temporary curtailment of a portion of the smelters in spain avilés 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear base capacity declined 291 kmt between december 31 2012 and 2011 due to the previously mentioned permanent shutdowns 

  

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the tennessee smelter and two potlines at the rockdale smelter remaining capacity of 191 kmtperyear composed of four potlines each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a full curtailment of the portovesme smelter and a partial curtailment at the avilés and la coruña smelters the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 

in 2013 aluminum production declined by 192 kmt mainly the result of the absence of production at the portovesme smelter fully curtailed at the end of 2012 the temporary curtailment of capacity at two smelters in brazil and the permanent shutdown of three potlines combined at smelters in canada and in the us 

in 2012 aluminum production decreased by 33 kmt mostly due to the previously mentioned curtailments at the portovesme avilés and la coruña smelters partially offset by the benefit of a full year of production related to capacity restarted in 2011 at the massena east 125 kmtperyear wenatchee wa 43 kmtperyear and ferndale wa intalco 47 kmtperyear smelters 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment declined 11 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to lower volumes including from the curtailed smelters in italy spain and brazil and the permanent shutdown of certain capacity in canada and the us also contributing to the decrease was a 4 decline in average realized prices somewhat offset by higher energy sales related to excess power mostly in brazil and favorable product mix the change in realized prices was driven by an 8 lower average lme price on 15day lag somewhat offset by higher regional premiums including an average of 12 in the us and 13 in europe 

thirdparty sales for this segment dropped 10 in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to a 12 decline in average realized prices driven by a 16 lower average lme price on 15day lag slightly offset by higher buyresell activity the us capacity restarted in 2011 contributed positively to thirdparty sales in 2012 but was completely offset by the curtailments of european capacity in 2012 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment declined 9 in 2013 compared with 2012 mainly the result of a decrease in both realized prices driven by a lower lme price and demand from the midstream and downstream businesses intersegment sales for this segment decreased 10 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to a decline in realized prices driven by a lower lme price 

atoi for the primary metals segment decreased 329 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily caused by a decline in realized prices the absence of a gain on the sale of tapoco see above higher costs for labor and transportation a higher equity loss related to the joint venture in saudi arabia due to startup costs and a shutdown of one of the two potlines due to a period of instability and costs related to planned maintenance outages at the anglesea power plant in australia and two us power plants these negative impacts were somewhat offset by lower costs for carbon and energy net productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar against most major currencies favorable product mix and a positive impact insurance recovery in 2013 plus the absence of business interruption and repair costs that occurred in 2012 related to the march 2012 fire at the massena west cast house 36 

atoi for this segment dropped 172 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally related to the previously mentioned decrease in realized prices higher costs particularly labor and other raw materials and an unfavorable impact as a 

  

result of business interruption and repair costs related to a fire in march 2012 at the massena west cast house 21 these negative impacts were partially offset by a gain on the sale of tapoco see above lower costs for alumina and energy net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar particularly against the euro and brazilian real and net productivity improvements 

in 2014 pricing is expected to follow a 15day lag on the lme also a higher equity loss related to startup activities at the smelter in saudi arabia will be fully operational in the second half of 2014 and overall higher energy prices in this segment’s smelting system are expected additionally the remaining 183 kmt of smelting capacity subject to the management review initiated in may 2013 will be completed in january 2014 management decided to permanently shut down the remaining 84 kmt at the massena east smelter 

global rolled products

thirdparty sales for the global rolled products segment declined 4 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily driven by unfavorable pricing mostly due to a decrease in metal prices and unfavorable product mix partially offset by increased demand volume improvements were mostly due to the packaging automotive and building and construction end markets partially offset by a decline in the industrial products end market especially in north america 

thirdparty sales for this segment decreased 3 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally caused by unfavorable pricing due to a decrease in metal prices and unfavorable foreign currency movements mostly due to a weaker euro somewhat offset by higher volumes and favorable product mix the higher volumes were largely attributable to the packaging automotive building and construction and aerospace end markets slightly offset by the industrial products end market 

atoi for the global rolled products segment declined 94 in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily attributable to a combination of unfavorable pricing and product mix higher input costs including metal premiums energy and labor and a negative impact from the timing lag in metal prices ie this segment realized a lower average metal price in sales compared to the average cost of the metal purchased these items were partially offset by net productivity improvements across most businesses 

atoi for this segment improved 86 in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly the result of net productivity improvements across all businesses favorable product mix and the previously mentioned higher volumes somewhat offset by higher input costs particularly labor and transportation 

  

in 2014 automotive demand is expected to remain strong for both auto and brazing sheet while industrial volumes are expected to strengthen with the recovering economies in the us and europe also volume and continued pricing pressures are expected to negatively impact the aerospace due to high original equipment manufacturer inventories and packaging end markets 

engineered products and solutions 

 

 this segment represents alcoa’s downstream operations and includes titanium aluminum and super alloy investment castings fasteners aluminum wheels integrated aluminum structural systems architectural extrusions and forgings and hard alloy extrusions these products which are used in the aerospace automotive building and construction commercial transportation power generation and industrial products end markets are sold directly to customers and through distributors

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment improved 4 in 2013 compared with 2012 largely attributable to higher volumes related to the aerospace end market 

thirdparty sales for this segment increased 3 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to higher volumes slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro the higher volumes were mostly related to the aerospace industrial gas turbine and commercial transportation end markets slightly offset by lower volumes from the building and construction end market 

atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment rose 114 in 2013 compared with 2012 principally the result of net productivity improvements across all businesses and the previously mentioned volume impact somewhat offset by higher costs including labor and research and development expenses and unfavorable priceproduct mix 

atoi for this segment climbed 75 in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to net productivity improvements in four of the five businesses and the previously mentioned higher volumes 

in 2014 the aerospace end market is expected to remain strong while the building and construction end market is expected to improve as the gradual recovery in north america continues and the decline in europe slows down also weaker global demand in the industrial gas turbine end market is anticipated while stronger north america build rates in the commercial transportation end market will be offset by declines in europe

along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa’s current operational and business needs for an analysis of longterm liquidity see contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements below 

at december 31 2013 cash and cash equivalents of alcoa were 1437 of which 544 was held outside the us alcoa has a number of commitments and obligations related to the company’s growth strategy in foreign jurisdictions resulting in the need for cash outside the us as such management does not have a current expectation of repatriating cash held in foreign jurisdictions 

cash from operations 

cash from operations in 2013 was 1578 compared with 1497 in 2012 the increase of 81 or 5 was largely attributable to higher operating results net loss plus net add back for noncash impacts to earnings and lower pension contributions of 99 mostly offset by a negative change associated with all of the following working capital of 235 noncurrent assets of 162 and noncurrent liabilities of 128 

the lower pension contributions were principally driven by a change in minimum funding obligations for us pension plans due to enacted legislation in 2012 see below 

the major components of the negative change in working capital were as follows an unfavorable change of 245 in receivables a negative change of 71 in inventories principally due to a lower lifo reserve a favorable change of 

  

53 in prepaid expenses and other current assets mostly caused by the sale of excess carbon credits in australia a positive change of 338 in accounts payable trade principally the result of timing of payments including a policy change in alcoa’s vendor payment process an unfavorable change of 252 in accrued expenses largely attributable to a decrease in deferred revenue and payments made to the italian government see below and a negative change of 58 in taxes including income taxes 

the unfavorable change in noncurrent assets was mostly related to an increase in deferred mining costs in australia and the absence of valueadded tax receipts in brazil the negative change in noncurrent liabilities was largely attributable to the absence of a net increase in the environmental reserve of 194 related to five remediation matters 

in 2014 alcoa world alumina llc a majorityowned subsidiary of alcoa and alcoa inc will pay a combined 88 to the united states government due to the resolution of a legal matter paid on january 22 2014 additionally another 74 will be paid in each of the four subsequent years 2015 through 2018 

cash from operations in 2012 was 1497 compared with 2193 in 2011 the decrease of 696 or 32 was primarily due to lower operating results higher pension contributions of 225 and an unfavorable change associated with working capital of 141 somewhat offset by a favorable change of 445 in noncurrent liabilities and a positive change of 163 in noncurrent assets 

the higher pension contributions were principally driven by the fact that in 2012 all contributions to the us pension plans were made in cash whereas in 2011 a 600 noncash contribution to the us pension plans was made in the form of company common stock 

the major components of the unfavorable change in working capital were as follows a favorable change of 219 in receivables primarily related to fewer uncollected receivables related to sales programs and lower customer sales a positive change of 435 in inventories mostly due to lower levels of onhand alumina and aluminum products and a decrease in the lme price of aluminum a negative change of 139 in prepaid expenses and other current assets largely attributable to the absence of a reduction in collateral posted related to marktomarket derivative contracts and an increase in both excess carbon emission credits and prepayments for natural gas in australia an unfavorable change of 406 in accounts payable trade principally the result of timing of payments a negative change of 150 in accrued expenses largely attributable to a payment made to the italian government see below a decrease in deferred revenue a payment made in the civil portion of a litigation matter see below and the absence of a charge related to the former st croix location and a negative change of 100 in taxes including income taxes mainly due to less income taxes caused by lower operating results somewhat offset by an income tax refund received for the carryback of a loss from a prior year in canada 

the favorable change in noncurrent liabilities was primarily caused by a net increase in the environmental reserve of 194 related to five remediation matters higher accrual for pension plans and an increase in deferred revenue related to a contract to deliver sheet and plate to a customer beginning in 2014 

in june 2012 alcoa received formal notification from the italian government requesting a net payment of 310 €250 related to a november 2009 european commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters alcoa commenced payment of the requested amount in five quarterly installments of 69 €50 beginning in october 2012 through december 2013

estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates among others the minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated 

  

to be 625 for 2014 625 for 2015 550 for 2016 440 for 2017 and 330 for 2018 these expected pension contributions reflect the impacts of the pension protection act of 2006 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 and the moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act the expected decline in pension contributions assumes that all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future other postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate 255 to 260 annually for years 2014 through 2018 and 240 annually for years 2019 through 2023 such payments will be slightly offset by subsidy receipts related to medicare part d which are estimated to be approximately 25 to 30 annually for years 2014 through 2023 alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2018 and 2023 respectively 

layoff and other restructuring payments expected to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to lease termination costs ongoing site remediation work and special termination benefit payments 

deferred revenue arrangements require alcoa to deliver alumina and sheet and plate to certain customers over the specified contract period through 2027 for an alumina contract and through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract while these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made 

uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december 31 2013 the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “thereafter” column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires then additional payments will not be necessary 

obligations for financing activities 

total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt including shortterm borrowings and longterm debt maturities for longterm debt extend to 2042 

alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock including dividends on preferred stock alcoa paid 132 in dividends to shareholders during 2013 because all dividends are subject to approval by alcoa’s board of directors amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred as of december 31 2013 there were 1071011162 and 546024 shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock respectively the annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of 375 per share and the annual common stock dividend is 012 per share 

obligations for investing activities 

capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of december 31 2013 funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects it is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources including cash provided from operations total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 1250 in 2014 

equity contributions represent alcoa’s committed investment related to a joint venture in saudi arabia alcoa is a participant in a joint venture to develop a new aluminum complex in saudi arabia comprised of a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill which will require the company to contribute approximately 1100 as of december 31 2013 alcoa has made equity contributions of 832 the timing of the amounts included in the preceding table may vary based on changes in anticipated construction schedules of the project 

payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds amounts 

  

are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur in connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in russia alcoa could be required to make contingent payments of approximately 50 through 2015 but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard 

offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2013 alcoa has maximum potential future payments for a guarantee issued on behalf of a third party of 542 this guarantee expires in 2019 and relates to project financing for the aluminum complex in saudi arabia in february 2013 a guarantee related to project financing for a hydroelectric power project in brazil was terminated as the outstanding debt of the consortium was repaid in full alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters outstanding debt workers compensation environmental obligations energy contracts and customs duties among others the total amount committed under these guarantees which expire at various dates between 2014 and 2022 was 370 at december 31 2013 

alcoa has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation energy contracts and leasing obligations the total amount committed under these letters of credit which automatically renew or expire at various dates mostly in 2014 was 333 at december 31 2013 alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters contract performance workers compensation environmentalrelated matters and customs duties the total amount committed under these bonds which automatically renew or expire at various dates mostly in 2014 was 170 at december 31 2013 

in march 2012 alcoa entered into an arrangement with a financial institution to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis the sale of such receivables is completed through the use of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity which is a consolidated subsidiary of alcoa this arrangement originally provided for minimum funding of 50 up to a maximum of 250 for receivables sold in may 2013 the arrangement was amended to increase the maximum funding to 500 and include two additional financial institutions on march 30 2012 alcoa initially sold 304 of customer receivables in exchange for 50 in cash and 254 of deferred purchase price under this arrangement alcoa received additional net cash funding of 5 388 in draws and 383 in repayments and 155 160 in draws and 5 in repayments in 2013 and 2012 respectively as of december 31 2013 and 2012 the deferred purchase price receivable was 248 and 18 respectively which was included in other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet the deferred purchase price receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur however as this is a revolving program the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable the net change in the deferred purchase price receivable was reflected in the increase decrease in receivables line item on the statement of consolidated cash flows this activity is reflected as an operating cash flow because the related customer receivables are the result of an operating activity with an insignificant shortterm interest rate risk in 2013 and 2012 the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase price receivable were 6985 and 6755 respectively and 3339 and 3321 respectively the gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collected under this program since its inception was 10324 and 9866 respectively alcoa services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates therefore no servicing asset or liability was recorded 

alcoa had three other arrangements each with a different financial institution to sell certain customer receivables outright without recourse on a continuous basis on march 22 2013 alcoa terminated these arrangements all receivables sold under these arrangements were collected as of march 31 2013 alcoa serviced the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates therefore no servicing asset or liability was recorded 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities environmental and litigation matters asset retirement obligations the testing of 

  

goodwill equity investments and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses to be divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

derivatives and hedging derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program for derivatives designated as fair value hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense 

alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing longterm debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges as a result the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense consistent with the underlying hedged item 

alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales cost of goods sold or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures generally not exceeding five years 

if no hedging relationship is designated the derivative is marked to market through earnings 

cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

  

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing andor method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record an aro for the removal treatment transportation storage andor disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks polychlorinated biphenyls various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2013 ranges from less than 1 to 52 per structure 131 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell or exit a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has nine reporting units of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment the primary metals segment the global rolled products segment and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil which is included in corporate more than 80 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to two reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs 1166 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1617 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment these amounts include an allocation of corporate’s goodwill 

  

in reviewing goodwill for impairment an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not greater than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the existing twostep quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test 

alcoa’s policy for its annual review of goodwill is to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test management will proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill this policy will result in each of the nine reporting units being subjected to the twostep quantitative impairment test at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2013 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for two reporting units the global rolled products segment and one of the five reporting units in the engineered products and solutions segment management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the two reporting units were less than their carrying values as such no further analysis was required 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a discounted cash flow dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices production costs tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

during the 2013 annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for seven reporting units as follows the primary metals segment the alumina segment the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and four of the five reporting units in the engineered products and solutions segment including 

  

afs and app the estimated fair values of the four engineered products and solutions businesses and the soft alloy extrusions business were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value resulting in no impairment 

during the 2012 annual testing of goodwill the estimated fair value of the alumina segment exceeded the carrying value by 7 in connection with the 2013 testing the estimated fair value of the alumina segment exceeded the carrying value by 18 this increase is attributable to several factors improved pricing due to the continued implementation of the alumina price index operating and productivity improvements in the business and a stronger us dollar all of which increased management’s estimates of operating results and cash flows used in assessing alumina’s goodwill for impairment these improvements were partially offset by an increase in the discount rate used in the dcf models unfavorable movements in one or more of these trends in the future could have a negative impact on the estimated fair value of the alumina segment 

for primary metals the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value as a result management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of primary metals’ goodwill the results of the secondstep analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero therefore in the fourth quarter of 2013 alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of 1731 1719 after noncontrolling interest as a result of the goodwill impairment there is no goodwill remaining for the primary metals reporting unit 

the impairment of primary metals’ goodwill results from several causes the prolonged economic downturn a disconnect between industry fundamentals and pricing that has resulted in lower metal prices and the increased cost of alumina a key raw material resulting from expansion of the alumina price index throughout the industry all of these factors exacerbated by increases in discount rates continue to place significant downward pressure on metal prices and operating margins and the resulting estimated fair value of the primary metals business as a result management decreased the nearterm and longterm estimates of the operating results and cash flows utilized in assessing primary metals’ goodwill for impairment the valuation of goodwill for the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is considered a level 3 fair value measurement which means that the valuation of the assets and liabilities reflect management’s own judgments regarding the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities 

goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company’s reporting units and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortia which are accounted for on the equity method the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with 

  

fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking consumer products transportation insurance and pharmaceutical among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2013 2012 and 2011 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 480 415 and 490 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 460 and either a charge or credit of 21 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fouryear average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on a combination of historical asset return information and forwardlooking returns by asset class as it relates to historical asset return information management focuses on the annual 10year moving and 20year moving averages when developing this assumption management also incorporates expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants as well as management’s own judgment 

for 2013 2012 and 2011 management used 850 as its expected longterm rate of return which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations as well as estimates of future returns by asset class this rate falls within the respective range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class for 2014 management determined that 800 will be the expected longterm rate of return the decrease of 50 basis points in the expected longterm rate of return is due to a combination of a decrease in the 20year moving average of actual performance and lower future expected market returns 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 18 for 2014 

in 2013 a net benefit of 876 531 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 65 basis point increase in the discount rate and the amortization of actuarial losses in 2012 a net charge of 769 529 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 75 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses in 2011 a net charge of 991 593 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to an 85 basis point 

  

decrease in the discount rate which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the amortization of actuarial losses 

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility annual forfeiture rate and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

equity grants are issued in january each year as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2013 2012 and 2011 was 71 48 aftertax 67 46 aftertax and 83 56 aftertax respectively of this amount 14 13 and 18 in 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not greater than 50 that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and alcoa’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance existing valuation allowances are reexamined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence if it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance if any is released deferred tax assets and liabilities are also remeasured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the granting and lapse of tax holidays 

in 2013 alcoa recognized a 372 discrete income tax charge for valuation allowances on certain deferred tax assets in spain and the us of this amount a 237 valuation allowance was established on the full value of the deferred tax assets related to a spanish consolidated tax group as of december 31 2013 these deferred tax assets have an expiration period ranging from 2014 to 2030 after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the tax benefit of these deferred tax assets this was mainly driven by a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business 2013 realized prices were the lowest since 2009 combined with prior year cumulative losses of the spanish consolidated tax 

  

group the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result a portion or all of the allowance may be reversed based on changes in facts and circumstances 

the remaining 135 relates to a valuation allowance established on a portion of available foreign tax credits in the us these credits can be carried forward for 10 years and as of december 31 2013 have an expiration period ranging from 2016 to 2023 after weighing all available positive and negative evidence as described above management determined that it was no longer more likely than not that alcoa will realize the full tax benefit of these foreign tax credits this was primarily due to lower foreign sourced taxable income after consideration of tax planning strategies and after the inclusion of earnings from foreign subsidiaries projected to be distributable as taxable foreign dividends similar to the outlook related to spain above lower levels of both distributable future foreign earnings and projected foreign sourced taxable income are principally attributable to a decline in the outlook of the primary metals business the need for this valuation allowance will be assessed on a continuous basis in future periods and as a result an increase or decrease to this allowance may result based on changes in facts and circumstances 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

overview 

alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina combined through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology mining refining smelting fabricating and recycling aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily aluminum and alumina represent more than 80 of alcoa’s revenues and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft automobiles commercial transportation packaging building and construction oil and gas defense consumer electronics and industrial applications 

alcoa is a global company operating in 30 countries based upon the country where the sale occurred the us and europe generated 52 and 25 respectively of alcoa’s sales in 2012 in addition alcoa has investments and operating activities in among others australia brazil china guinea iceland russia and the kingdom of saudi 

  

arabia all of which present opportunities for substantial growth governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates affect the results of operations in these countries 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals global rolled products and engineered products and solutions 

description of the business 

information describing alcoa’s businesses can be found on the indicated pages of this report 

 

 the following tables and related discussion of the company’s bauxite interests alumina refining and primary aluminum facilities and capacities global rolled products engineered products and solutions and corporate facilities provide additional description of alcoa’s businesses the alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac alcoa owns 60 and alumina limited owns 40 of these individual entities for more information on awac see exhibit nos 10a through 10f1 to this report 

bauxite interests 

aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust and is produced primarily from bauxite an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide commonly referred to as alumina aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina the company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the awac enterprise located in the countries listed in the table below as well as pursuant to both longterm and shortterm contracts and mining leases in 2012 alcoa consumed 45 million metric tons mt of bauxite from awac and its own resources 71 million mt from related third parties and 11 million mt from unrelated third parties tons of bauxite are reported as bone dry metric tons bdmt unless otherwise stated see the glossary of bauxite mining related terms at the end of this section 

the company has access to large bauxite deposit areas with mining rights that extend in most cases more than 20 years from today for purposes of evaluating the amount of bauxite that will be available to supply as feedstock to its refineries the company considers both estimates of bauxite resources as well as calculated bauxite reserves bauxite resources represent deposits for which tonnage densities shape physical characteristics grade and mineral content can be estimated with a reasonable level of confidence based on the amount of exploration sampling and testing 

  

information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops trenches pits workings and drill holes bauxite reserves represent the economically mineable part of resource deposits and include diluting materials and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined appropriate assessments and studies have been carried out to define the reserves and include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining metallurgical economic marketing legal environmental social and governmental factors alcoa employs a conventional approach including additional drilling with successive tightening of the drill grid with customized techniques to define and characterize its various bauxite deposit types allowing alcoa to confidently establish the extent of its bauxite resources and their ultimate conversion to reserves 

the table below only includes the amount of proven and probable reserves controlled by the company while the level of reserves may appear low in relation to annual production levels they are consistent with historical levels of reserves for our mining locations given the company’s extensive bauxite resources the abundant supply of bauxite globally and the length of the company’s rights to bauxite it is not costeffective to invest the significant resources necessary to establish bauxite reserves that reflect the total size of the bauxite resources available to the company rather bauxite resources are upgraded annually to reserves as needed by the location detailed assessments are progressively undertaken within a proposed mining area and mine activity is then planned to achieve a uniform quality in the supply of blended feedstock to the relevant refinery alcoa believes its present sources of bauxite on a global basis are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future 

bauxite resource development guidelines 

alcoa has developed best practice guidelines for bauxite reserve and resource classification at its operating bauxite mines alcoa’s reserves are declared in accordance with alcoa’s internal guidelines as administered by the alcoa ore reserve committee aorc the reported ore reserves set forth in the table below are those that alcoa estimates could be extracted economically with current technology and in current market conditions alcoa does not use a price for bauxite alumina or aluminum to determine its bauxite reserves the primary criteria for determining bauxite reserves are the feed specifications required by the customer alumina refinery in addition to these specifications a number of modifying factors have been applied to differentiate bauxite reserves from other mineralized material alcoa mining locations have annual infill drilling programs designed to progressively upgrade the reserve classification of their bauxite

 sources and availability of raw materials 

the major raw materials purchased in 2012 for each of the company’s reportable segments are listed below 

 

 generally other materials are purchased from third party suppliers under competitivelypriced supply contracts or bidding arrangements the company believes that the raw materials necessary to its business are and will continue to be available 

for each metric ton of alumina produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

   

for each metric ton of aluminum produced alcoa consumes the following amounts of the identified raw material inputs approximate range across relevant facilities 

 

 explanatory note certain aluminum produced by alcoa also includes alloying materials because of the number of different types of elements that can be used to produce alloy aluminum products providing a range of such elements would not be meaningful with the exception of a very small number of internally used products alcoa produces its alloys in adherence to an aluminum association standard the aluminum association of which alcoa is an active member uses a specific designation system to identify alloy types in general each alloy type has a major alloying element other than aluminum but will also have other constituents as well but of lesser amounts 

energy 

employing the bayer process alcoa refines alumina from bauxite ore alcoa then produces aluminum from the alumina by an electrolytic process requiring substantial amounts of electric power energy accounts for approximately 25 of the company’s total alumina refining production costs electric power accounts for approximately 26 of the company’s primary aluminum production costs alcoa generates approximately 20 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters and refineries 

north america – electricity 

the deschambault baie comeau and bécancour smelters in québec purchase electricity under existing contracts that run through 2015 which will be followed by longterm contracts with hydroquébec first executed in december 2008 revised in 2012 and expiring in 2040 provided that alcoa completes the modernization of the baie comeau smelter by september 2016 the smelter located in baie comeau québec has historically purchased approximately 65 of its power needs under the hydroquébec contract receiving the remainder from a 40 owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power limited partnership mplp beginning on january 1 2011 these percentages changed such that approximately 80 is sourced from hydroquébec with the remaining 20 from mplp 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 29 of the power requirements for alcoa’s smelters operating in the us the company generally purchases the remainder under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates the yadkin hydroelectric project consisting of four dams in north carolina in november 2012 apgi finalized the sale of its tapoco hydroelectric project to brookfield renewable energy partners 

the relicensing process continues for yadkin in 2007 apgi filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc a relicensing settlement agreement with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues the national environmental policy act process is complete with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in april 2008 the remaining requirement for the relicensing was the issuance by north carolina of the required water quality certification under section 401 of the clean water act the section 401 water quality certification was issued on may 7 2009 but was appealed and has been stayed since late may 2009 pending substantive determination on the appeal on december 1 

  

2010 apgi received notice from north carolina of its revocation of the section 401 water quality certification and apgi appealed the revocation in september 2012 the north carolina administrative law judge dismissed without prejudice the revocation appeal and apgi filed a new application for a 401 certificate this enables apgi to have a fresh start to the 401 application process and the state is required to act on the application within one year or it is deemed granted apgi received a yeartoyear license renewal from ferc in may 2008 and will continue to operate under annual licenses until a new section 401 certification is issued and the ferc relicensing process is complete since the permanent closure of the badin north carolina smelter power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing llc and then sold into the wholesale market proceeds from sales to the wholesale market are used to offset higher priced power contracts at other us operations 

apgi generates substantially all of the power used at the company’s warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves since may 2005 alcoa has owned the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves with the mine being operated by vigo coal company inc the mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year in june 2011 the red brush west mine owned by alcoa and operated by vigo coal was opened and produced approximately 60000 tons per month over an eighteenmonth period in 2012 the two owned mines provided approximately 85 of the warrick power plant’s requirements the balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration red brush west mine will halt production in the first quarter of 2013 liberty mine owned by alcoa and operated by vigo coal will begin producing coal in the second quarter of 2013 and will be a one million ton per year mine friendsville and liberty mines will combine to supply 95 of the power plant’s future needs 

in the state of washington alcoa’s wenatchee smelter operates under a contract with chelan county public utility district chelan pud under which alcoa receives approximately 26 of the hydropower output of chelan pud’s rocky reach and rock island dams 

for the period from december 22 2009 to december 31 2012 alcoa and the bonneville power administration bpa operated under a contract providing for the sale of physical power to the intalco smelter at the northwest power act mandated industrial firm power ip rate on january 1 2013 a new contract executed between alcoa and bpa became effective under which alcoa receives physical power at the ip rate through september 30 2022 

prior to 2007 power for the rockdale smelter in texas was historically supplied from companyowned generating units and units owned by luminant generation company llc formerly txu generation company lp luminant both of which used lignite supplied by the company’s sandow mine upon completion of lignite mining in the sandow mine in 2005 lignite supply transitioned to the formerly alcoaowned three oaks mine the company retired its three whollyowned generating units at rockdale sandow units 1 2 and 3 in late 2006 and transitioned to an arrangement under which luminant is to supply all of the rockdale smelter’s electricity requirements under a longterm power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038 with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price in august 2007 luminant and alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which luminant has constructed and operates a new circulating fluidized bed power plant sandow unit 5 adjacent to the existing sandow unit 4 and in september 2007 on the sale of three oaks mine to luminant concurrent with entering into the agreements under which luminant constructed and operates sandow unit 5 alcoa and luminant entered into a power purchase agreement whereby alcoa purchased power from luminant that sandow unit 5 power purchase agreement was terminated by alcoa effective december 1 2010 in june 2008 alcoa temporarily idled half of the capacity at the rockdale smelter and in november 2008 curtailed the remainder of rockdale’s smelting capacity in late 2011 alcoa announced that it would permanently close two of the six idled potlines at its rockdale texas smelter demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in the first half of 2012 and are expected to be completed in 2013 in august 2012 alcoa and the lower colorado river authority lcra announced that they had entered into an agreement whereby alcoa will sell to lcra all of the real estate associated with the rockdale location along with all of alcoa’s surface and groundwater rights and certain plant and equipment assets other than the smelter and atomizer and assign alcoa’s power contracts with luminant to lcra lcra is currently conducting due diligence associated with the proposed transaction if consummated closing is expected to occur prior to september 2013

europe – electricity 

until december 31 2005 the company purchased electricity for its smelters at portovesme and fusina italy under a power supply structure approved by the european commission ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government in 2005 italy granted an extension of the regulated electricity tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 in july 2006 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy complied with european union eu state aid rules on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in its investigation stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and ordered the italian government to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal against the decision of the ec with the european general court additionally on may 22 2010 alcoa filed an application for interim measures suspension of decision in connection with the ec at the european general court on july 12 2010 the european general court dismissed the request for interim measures due to lack of urgency alcoa appealed this ruling on september 10 2010 this appeal was dismissed by the european court of justice on december 16 2011 on february 25 2010 the italian government issued a decree law no3 2010 implementing a request from the electrical transmission system operator to reinforce the level of system security on the islands of sicily and sardinia the decree law provides the means for endconsumers to provide and be paid for interruptible services up to december 31 2012 on may 26 2010 the ec ruled that the scheme introduced by the decree law to be a “nonaid” alcoa applied for and gained rights to sell this service in sardinia from the portovesme smelter additional details about this matter are in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report on july 29 2010 alcoa reached agreement with a power supplier to enter into a new contract expiring on december 31 2012 this arrangement would have enabled operation of the portovesme smelter through december 31 2012 in january 2012 alcoa announced that it decided to curtail operations at its portovesme smelter this curtailment was completed in november 2012 this curtailment may lead to the permanent closure of the facility additionally in 2010 the fusina smelter was temporarily curtailed due to high energy costs as of june 30 2010 the fusina smelter was fully curtailed 

alcoa’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts the contracts that commenced in may 2009 expired on december 31 2012 and have been replaced with new bilateral contracts commencing on january 1 2013 the contracts for san ciprián and avilés smelters each have a 4 year term the contract for the la coruña smelter is for a single year prior to the establishment of power supply under the bilateral contracts alcoa was supplied under a regulated power tariff on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa operated in spain for more than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system a decision by the ec has not yet been made if the ec’s investigation concludes that 

  

the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts due to the high cost position of the la coruña and avilés smelters combined with rising raw material costs and falling aluminum prices in early january 2012 alcoa announced its intentions to partially and temporarily curtail its la coruña and avilés spain smelters the partial curtailments were completed in the first half of 2012 as a result of a modification to the load interruptibility regime currently in place in the spanish power market alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion 25000 mpty combined for avilés and la coruña of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime see the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section for more information 

in march 2009 alcoa and orkla asa exchanged respective stakes in the sapa ab and elkem aluminium ans companies pursuant to the exchange alcoa assumed 100 ownership of the two smelters in norway lista and mosjøen at the end of the first quarter of 2009 these smelters have longterm power arrangements in place which continue until at least 2019 

iceland – electricity 

alcoa’s fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland began operation in 2007 central to those operations is a fortyyear power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company built the kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter in late 2009 iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries both for a period of three years from 2010 through 2012 one tax is based on energy consumption the other is a prepayment of certain other charges and will be recoverable from 2013 through 2015 in 2012 iceland extended the energy consumption tax though 2015 

north america – natural gas 

in order to supply its refineries and smelters in the us and canada alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity and the interstate pipeline transportation are procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

australia – natural gas 

aofa holds a 20 equity interest in a consortium that bought the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to aofa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia aofa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries approximately 85 of aofa’s gas supplies are under longterm contract out to 2020 aofa is progressing multiple supply options to replace expiring contracts including investing directly in projects that have the potential to deliver costbased gas

 item 1a risk factors 

alcoa’s business financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following risks and uncertainties could materially harm our business financial condition or results of operations including causing alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements the following list of significant risk factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to alcoa or that alcoa currently deems immaterial also may materially adversely affect us in future periods 

  

the aluminum industry generally remains highly cyclical and is influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical and alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and aluminum enduse markets alcoa sells many products to industries that are cyclical such as the commercial construction and transportation industries and the demand for our products is sensitive to and quickly impacted by demand for the finished goods manufactured by our customers in these industries which may change as a result of changes in the general us or worldwide economy currency exchange rates energy prices or other factors beyond our control for example 2012 was a turbulent year in the world economy characterized by an uneven recovery in many regions and prolonged volatility and crisis in others namely europe and demand for aluminum was impacted by this turbulence while alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum remain positive the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength pace or sustainability of the economic recovery and the effects of government intervention negative economic conditions such as another major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

marketdriven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by nonmarket forces or other impediments to production closures 

in response to marketdriven factors relating to the global supply and demand of aluminum alcoa has recently curtailed portions of its aluminum production certain other aluminum producers have independently undertaken to make cuts in production as well however the existence of nonmarket forces on global aluminum industry capacity such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry selfsufficiency may prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers’ smelters irrespective of their position on the industry cost curve other production cuts may be impeded by longterm contracts to buy power or raw materials if industry overcapacity persists due to the disruption by such nonmarket forces on the marketdriven balancing of the global supply and demand of aluminum the resulting weak pricing environment and margin compression may adversely affect the operating results of aluminum producers including alcoa 

a reduction in demand or a lack of increased demand for aluminum by china europe or a combined number of other countries may negatively impact alcoa’s results 

the aluminum industry’s demand is highly correlated to economic growth for example the ongoing european sovereign debt crisis has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on european supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum products the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for commodities including aluminum a sustained slowdown in china’s economic growth and aluminum demand that is not offset by increased aluminum demand in emerging economies such as india brazil and several south east asian countries or the combined slowdown of other markets could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices a reduction in demand or a lack of increased demand in global markets could materially harm alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices 

the price of aluminum is frequently volatile and changes in response to general economic conditions expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets has also increased in recent years contributing to higher levels of price volatility in 2012 the lme price of aluminum reached a high of approximately 2300 per metric ton and a low of approximately 1800 per metric ton declines in the lme price have had a negative impact on alcoa’s results of operations continued high lme inventories could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum a sustained weak aluminum pricing environment or a deterioration in aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

  

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts certain conditions could negatively affect alcoa’s results of operations including the following 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if events such as those listed above were to occur the resulting high energy costs or the disruption of an energy source or the requirement to repay all or a portion of the benefit alcoa received under a power supply interruptibility regime could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business and results of operations 

alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects of decreases in commodity or lmelinked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations alcoa may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results are affected by significant lag effects of declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in the lmelinked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period increases in the cost of raw materials or decreases in input costs that are disproportionate to concurrent sharper decreases in the price of aluminum could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s operating results 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro and norwegian kroner may affect alcoa’s profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies while the company’s products are generally sold in us dollars 

  

alcoa may not be able to successfully realize goals established in each of its four business segments at the levels or by the dates targeted for such goals 

alcoa established targets for each of its four major business segments including the following 

 

  

  

  

 there can be no assurance that any of these initiatives will be completed as anticipated market conditions or other factors may prevent alcoa from accomplishing its goals at the levels or by the dates targeted if at all and failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or the market price of our securities 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from its growth projects or from its streamlining portfolio strategy 

alcoa’s growth projects include the joint venture with ma’aden in saudi arabia the completed são luís refinery expansion the juruti bauxite mine and the ongoing estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil the automotive expansion at the davenport iowa fabrication plant and the china and russia growth projects although management believes that these projects will be beneficial to alcoa there is no assurance that anticipated benefits will be realized adverse factors may prevent alcoa from realizing the benefits of its growth projects including unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or unexpected delays in target timelines 

alcoa has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to grow or streamline its portfolio alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders in addition alcoa may retain unforeseen liabilities for divested entities if the buyer fails to honor all commitments acquisitions also present significant challenges and risks including the effective integration of the business into the company and unanticipated costs and liabilities and the company may be unable to manage acquisitions successfully there can be no assurance that acquisitions and divestitures will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or that they will be beneficial to alcoa 

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future for example in december 2009 alcoa formed a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex including a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill in the kingdom of saudi arabia in november 2012 alcoa and china power investment corporation cpi established a joint venture company to produce highend fabricated aluminum products in china although the company has in connection with the saudi arabia joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances inherently involve special risks whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

  

   

  

 in addition the joint venture with ma’aden is subject to risks associated with large infrastructure construction projects including the consequences of noncompliance with the timeline and other requirements under the gas supply arrangements for the joint venture there can be no assurance that the project as a whole will be completed within budget or that the project phases will be completed by their targeted completion dates or that it or alcoa’s other joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

alcoa faces significant competition which may have an adverse effect on profitability 

as discussed in part i item 1 business—competitive conditions of this report the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets including some that are subsidized in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings could limit alcoa’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs adversely affect the market price of its existing securities or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

alcoa’s longterm debt is currently rated bbb with stable outlook by standard and poor’s ratings services and bbb with stable outlook by fitch ratings moody’s investors services rates alcoa’s longterm debt at baa3 but announced in december 2012 that it has placed alcoa’s credit ratings on review for possible downgrade there can be no assurance that any rating assigned by a rating agency will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant 

maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of alcoa’s financial strategy a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market price of its securities adversely affect existing financing limit access to the capital or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or impair its business financial condition and results of operations in addition under the project financings for the joint venture project in the kingdom of saudi arabia a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings below investment grade by at least two rating agencies would require alcoa to provide a letter of credit or fund an escrow account for a portion or all of alcoa’s remaining equity commitment to the joint venture for additional information regarding the project financings see note i to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

alcoa could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under committed credit facilities 

as discussed in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—liquidity and capital resources of this report alcoa has a committed revolving credit facility with financial institutions available for its use for which the company pays commitment fees the facility is provided by a syndicate of several financial institutions with each institution agreeing severally and not jointly to make revolving 

  

credit loans to alcoa in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement if one or more of the financial institutions providing the committed credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment the portion of the committed facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to the company 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from the change to index pricing of alumina 

alcoa has implemented a move to a pricing mechanism for alumina based on an index of alumina prices rather than a percentage of the lmebased aluminum price alcoa believes that this change expected to affect approximately 20 of annual contracts coming up for renewal each year will more fairly reflect the fundamentals of alumina including raw materials and other input costs involved there can be no assurance that such index pricing ultimately will be accepted or that such index pricing will result in consistently greater profitability from sales of alumina 

alcoa’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by reductions in its capital expenditures 

alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in greenfield and brownfield projects and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities for 2013 alcoa’s target is to generate positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending insufficient cash generation may negatively impact alcoa’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and growth capital projects over the long term alcoa’s ability to take advantage of improved aluminum market conditions may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions and the longterm value of its business could be adversely impacted the company’s position in relation to its competitors may also deteriorate 

alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates if alcoa’s interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions its growth could be constrained any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

alcoa’s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the us that have varying degrees of political and economic risk including china europe guinea russia and the kingdom of saudi arabia risks include those associated with sovereign and private debt default political instability civil unrest expropriation nationalization renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements mining leases and permits commercial instability caused by corruption and changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition or operating results 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

cyber attacks and security breaches may threaten the integrity of alcoa’s trade secrets intellectual property and other sensitive information disrupt our business operations and result in reputational harm and other negative consequences 

alcoa faces cybersecurity threats including threats to its information technology infrastructure and attempts to misappropriate or compromise its confidential information or that of third parties or create system disruptions the 

  

company has experienced cybersecurity attacks in the past that attempted to gain unauthorized access to its information systems to export companysensitive data and may experience them in the future potentially with more frequency or sophistication although its technology security measures have been able to prevent the majority of these attempts from being successful the company is aware of breaches of its systems in which information from its servers has been taken the company continues to investigate these incidents and based on the information known to date the company does not believe that the theft of the information is material to the company however the impact of these and other such attacks and the resulting damage may only be clear over time and after more intensive analysis in addition due to the evolving nature of cybersecurity threats the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted while we continually work to implement additional steps to safeguard our systems there is no assurance that we can prevent future breaches if alcoa is unable to detect or ward off attacks on its information systems or if an attack results in the theft of material companysensitive information such as intellectual property trade secrets product development data and other business development data or if an attack results in a material disruption of its systems alcoa’s business financial condition and reputation may be materially adversely affected additionally the company has been subject to attempts to disrupt its website through “denial of service” attacks although such attempts did not have a material negative impact on the company no assurance can be given that future attempts will not impact the company 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws antibribery laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts 

while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental laws may impose cleanup liability on owners and occupiers of contaminated property including past or divested properties regardless of whether the owners and occupiers caused the contamination or whether the activity that caused the contamination was lawful at the time it was conducted environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by us sites owned by our predecessors or sites 

  

that we may acquire in the future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to certain sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

climate change climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia australia’s carbon pricing mechanism introduced in 2012 quebec’s transition to a “cap and trade” system with compliance required in 2013 and european direct emission regulations expected by 2013 alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers or alcoa’s supply chain inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly from changes in costs of goods sold 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect alcoa’s future profitability 

alcoa is subject to income taxes in both the united states and various nonus jurisdictions and its domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions alcoa’s tax expense includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions including assessments of future earnings of the company that could impact the valuation of its deferred tax assets the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the overall profitability of the company changes in tax legislation and rates changes in generally accepted accounting principles changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of its tax exposures corporate tax reform and tax law changes continue to be analyzed in the united states and in many other jurisdictions significant changes to the us corporate tax system in particular could have a substantial impact positive and negative on alcoa’s effective tax rate cash tax expenditures and deferred tax assets and liabilities 

adverse changes in discount rates lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations or level of pension funding contributions in future periods 

alcoa’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense alcoa records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans reductions in the fair value of plan assets and other factors us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations 

  

these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the large decline in our funded status in 2008 due to the financial crisis generated significant unrecognized actuarial losses we anticipate that expense in future years will continue to be affected as the unrecognized losses are recognized in earnings in addition alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how alcoa’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under note w to the consolidated financial statements—pension and other postretirement benefits 

although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities alcoa would contribute to the pension plans potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status the recently enacted moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act provides temporary relief for employers like alcoa who sponsor defined benefit pension plans related to funding contributions under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 by allowing the use of a 25year average interest rate within an upper and lower range for purposes of determining minimum funding obligations instead of an average interest rate for the two most recent years as currently is the case alcoa has elected this temporary relief and believes that it will moderately reduce the cash flow sensitivity of the company’s us pension plans’ funded status to additional declines in discount rates over the next two to three years however higher than expected pension contributions due to a further decline in our funded status as a result of additional declines in the discount rate or lowerthanexpected investment returns on plan assets could have a material negative effect on our cash flows adverse capital market conditions could result in reductions in the fair value of plan assets and increase the company’s liabilities related to such plans adversely affecting alcoa’s liquidity and results of operations 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

a significant portion of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates while alcoa was successful in renegotiating the master collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers in june 2010 alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate other collective bargaining agreements in the us and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

alcoa’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

alcoa’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company or the industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoa’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

alcoa may not realize expected longterm benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies and deployment of companywide business process models 

  

such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there is no assurance that these initiatives will all be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode and carbothermic technology in addition to multialloy casting processes there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance further existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

further metals industry consolidation could impact alcoa’s business 

the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted alcoa’s business further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential 

litigation 

as previously reported along with various asbestos manufacturers and distributors alcoa and its subsidiaries as premises owners are defendants in several hundred active lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly as a result of occupational exposure to asbestos at various company facilities in addition an alcoa subsidiary company has been named along with a large common group of industrial companies in a pattern complaint where the company’s involvement is not evident since 1999 several thousand such complaints have been filed to date the subsidiary has been dismissed from almost every case that was actually placed in line for trial alcoa its subsidiaries and acquired companies all have had numerous insurance policies over the years that provide coverage for asbestos based claims many of these policies provide layers of coverage for varying periods of time and for varying locations alcoa has significant insurance coverage and believes that its reserves are adequate for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities the costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations cash flows and financial position of the company 

as previously reported in november 2006 in curtis v alcoa inc civil action no 306cv448 ed tenn a class action was filed by plaintiffs representing approximately 13000 retired former employees of alcoa or reynolds metals company and spouses and dependents of such retirees alleging violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa and the labormanagement relations act by requiring plaintiffs beginning january 1 2007 to pay health insurance premiums and increased copayments and coinsurance for certain medical procedures and prescription drugs plaintiffs alleged these changes to their retiree health care plans violated their rights to vested health care benefits plaintiffs additionally alleged that alcoa had breached its fiduciary duty to plaintiffs under erisa by misrepresenting to them that their health benefits would never change plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief back payment of benefits and attorneys’ fees alcoa had consented to treatment of plaintiffs’ claims as a class action during the fourth quarter of 2007 following briefing and argument the court ordered consolidation of the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction with trial certified a plaintiff class bifurcated and stayed the plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claims struck the plaintiffs’ jury demand but indicated it would use an advisory jury and set a trial date of september 17 2008 in august 2008 the court set a new trial date of march 24 2009 and subsequently the trial date was moved to september 22 2009 in june 2009 the court indicated that it would not use an advisory jury at trial trial in the matter was held over eight days commencing september 22 2009 and ending on october 1 2009 in federal court in knoxville tn before the honorable thomas phillips us district court judge at the conclusion of evidence the court set a posthearing briefing schedule for submission of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by the parties and for replies to the same post trial briefing was submitted on december 4 2009 

on march 9 2011 the court issued a judgment order dismissing plaintiffs’ lawsuit in its entirety with prejudice for the reasons stated in its findings of fact and conclusions of law on march 23 2011 plaintiffs filed a motion for clarification andor amendment of the judgment order which seeks among other things a declaration that plaintiffs’ 

  

retiree benefits are vested subject to an annual cap and an injunction preventing alcoa prior to 2017 from modifying the plan design to which plaintiffs are subject or changing the premiums and deductibles that plaintiffs must pay also on march 23 2011 plaintiffs filed a motion for award of attorneys’ fees and expenses alcoa filed its opposition to both motions on april 11 2011 on june 11 2012 the court issued its memorandum and order denying plaintiffs’ motion for clarification andor amendment to the original judgment order on july 6 2012 plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the court’s march 9 2011 judgment on july 12 2012 the trial court stayed alcoa’s motion for assessment of costs pending resolution of plaintiffs’ appeal the appeal is docketed in the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit as case number 125801 on august 29 2012 the trial court dismissed plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys’ fees without prejudice to refiling the motion following the resolution of the appeal at the sixth circuit court of appeals briefing on the appeal is complete and oral argument is scheduled for march 6 2013 

alba civil suit 

as previously reported on february 27 2008 alcoa inc alcoa received notice that aluminium bahrain bsc alba had filed suit against alcoa awa and william rice collectively the alcoa parties and others in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania the court civil action number 08299 styled aluminium bahrain bsc v alcoa inc alcoa world alumina llc william rice and victor phillip dahdaleh the complaint alleged that certain alcoa entities and their agents including victor phillip dahdaleh had engaged in a conspiracy over a period of 15 years to defraud alba the complaint further alleged that alcoa and its employees or agents 1 illegally bribed officials of the government of bahrain andor officers of alba in order to force alba to purchase alumina at excessively high prices 2 illegally bribed officials of the government of bahrain andor officers of alba and issued threats in order to pressure alba to enter into an agreement by which alcoa would purchase an equity interest in alba and 3 assigned portions of existing supply contracts between alcoa and alba for the sole purpose of facilitating alleged bribes and unlawful commissions the complaint alleged that alcoa and the other defendants violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and committed fraud alba claimed damages in excess of 1 billion alba’s complaint sought treble damages with respect to its rico claims compensatory consequential exemplary and punitive damages rescission of the 2005 alumina supply contract and attorneys’ fees and costs 

in response to a motion filed by the us department of justice doj on march 27 2008 see government investigations below the court ordered the alba civil suit administratively closed and stayed all discovery to allow the doj to fully conduct an investigation on november 8 2011 at alcoa’s request the court removed the case from administrative stay and ordered alba to file an amended complaint by november 28 2011 and a rico case statement 30 days thereafter for the limited purpose of allowing alcoa to move to dismiss alba’s lawsuit alcoa filed a motion to dismiss which was denied on june 11 2012 

during the second quarter of 2012 alcoa proposed to settle the suit by offering alba a cash payment of 45 million alcoa also offered alba a longterm alumina supply contract based on the cash offer alcoa recorded a 45 million 18 million aftertax and noncontrolling interest charge in the 2012 second quarter representing alcoa’s estimate of the minimum end of the range probable to settle the case and estimated an additional reasonably possible charge of up to 75 million to settle the suit 

on october 9 2012 the alcoa parties without admitting any liability entered into a settlement agreement with alba the agreement called for awa to pay alba 85 million in two equal installments onehalf at time of settlement and onehalf one year later and for the case against the alcoa parties to be dismissed with prejudice additionally awa and alba entered into a longterm alumina supply agreement on october 9 2012 pursuant to the settlement agreement awa paid alba 425 million and all claims against the alcoa parties were dismissed with prejudice under the agreement awa is obligated to pay an additional 425 million without interest or contingency on october 9 2013 based on the settlement agreement in the 2012 third quarter alcoa recorded a 40 million 15 million aftertax and noncontrolling interest charge in addition to the 45 million 18 million aftertax and noncontrolling interest charge it recorded in the 2012 second quarter in respect of the suit in addition based on an agreement between alcoa and alumina limited which holds a 40 equity interest in awa alcoa estimates an additional reasonably possible aftertax charge of between 25 million to 30 million to reallocate a portion of the 

  

costs including legal fees of the alba civil settlement from awa to alcoa but this would occur only if a settlement is reached with the doj and the securities and exchange commission the sec regarding their investigations see government investigations below 

government investigations 

as previously reported on february 26 2008 alcoa inc advised the doj and the sec that it had recently become aware of the claims by alba as alleged in the alba civil suit had already begun an internal investigation and intended to cooperate fully in any investigation that the doj or the sec may commence on march 17 2008 the doj notified alcoa that it had opened a formal investigation and alcoa has been cooperating with the government since that time 

alcoa is actively negotiating with the doj and the sec to reach a resolution of their investigations of the alba matter however alcoa has not reached any agreement with either agency given the uncertainty regarding whether a settlement can be reached and if reached on what terms alcoa is not able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss with regard to any such settlement if a settlement of the government investigations is reached alcoa believes that the settlement amount would be material to alcoa’s results of operations for the relevant fiscal period if a settlement cannot be reached alcoa will proceed to trial with the doj and the sec and under those circumstances is unable to predict an outcome or to estimate its reasonably possible loss there can be no assurance that the final outcome of the government’s investigations will not have a material adverse effect on alcoa 

derivative actions 

as previously reported on july 21 2008 the teamsters local 500 severance fund and the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority filed a shareholder derivative suit in the civil division of the court of common pleas of allegheny county pennsylvania against certain officers and directors of alcoa claiming breach of fiduciary duty gross mismanagement and other violations this derivative action stems from the civil litigation brought by alba against alcoa awa victor phillip dahdaleh and others and the subsequent investigation of alcoa by the doj and the sec with respect to alba’s claims this derivative action claims that the defendants caused or failed to prevent the matters alleged in the alba lawsuit the director defendants filed a motion to dismiss on november 21 2008 on september 3 2009 a hearing was held on alcoa’s motion and on october 12 2009 the court issued its order denying alcoa’s motion to dismiss but finding that a derivative action during the conduct of the doj investigation and pendency of the underlying complaint by alba would be contrary to the interest of shareholders and therefore stayed the case until further order of the court this derivative action is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

as previously reported on march 6 2009 the philadelphia gas works retirement fund filed a shareholder derivative suit in the civil division of the court of common pleas of philadelphia county pennsylvania this action was brought against certain officers and directors of alcoa claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other violations and is based on the allegations made in the previously disclosed civil litigation brought by alba against alcoa awa victor phillip dahdaleh and others and the subsequent investigation of alcoa by the doj and the sec with respect to alba’s claims this derivative action claims that the defendants caused or failed to prevent the conduct alleged in the alba lawsuit on august 7 2009 the director and officer defendants filed an unopposed motion to coordinate the case with the teamsters local 500 suit described immediately above in the allegheny county common pleas court the allegheny county court issued its order consolidating the case on september 18 2009 thereafter on october 31 2009 the court assigned this action to the commerce and complex litigation division of the allegheny court of common pleas and on november 20 2009 the court granted defendants’ motion to stay all proceedings in the philadelphia gas action until the earlier of the court lifting the stay in the teamsters derivative action or further order of the court in this action this derivative action is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss

as previously reported before 2002 alcoa purchased power in italy in the regulated energy market and received a drawback of a portion of the price of power under a special tariff in an amount calculated in accordance with a published resolution of the italian energy authority energy authority resolution n 2041999 2041999 in 2001 the energy authority published another resolution which clarified that the drawback would be calculated in the same manner and in the same amount in either the regulated or unregulated market at the beginning of 2002 alcoa left the regulated energy market to purchase energy in the unregulated market subsequently in 2004 the energy authority introduced regulation no 1482004 which set forth a different method for calculating the special tariff that would result in a different drawback for the regulated and unregulated markets alcoa challenged the new regulation in the administrative court of milan and received a favorable judgment in 2006 following this ruling alcoa continued to receive the power price drawback in accordance with the original calculation method through 2009 when the european commission declared all such special tariffs to be impermissible “state aid” in 2010 the energy authority appealed the 2006 ruling to the consiglio di stato final court of appeal on december 2 2011 the consiglio di stato ruled in favor of the energy authority and against alcoa thus presenting the opportunity for the energy regulators to seek reimbursement from alcoa of an amount equal to the difference between the actual drawback amounts received over the relevant time period and the drawback as it would have been calculated in accordance with regulation 1482004 on february 23 2012 alcoa filed its appeal of the decision of the consiglio di stato and that appeal remains pending on march 26 2012 alcoa received a letter from the agency cassa conguaglio per il settore eletrico ccse responsible for making and collecting payments on behalf of the energy authority demanding payment in the amount of approximately 110 million €85 million including interest by letter dated april 5 2012 alcoa informed ccse that it disputes the payment demand of ccse since i ccse was not authorized by the consiglio di stato decisions to seek payment of any amount ii the decision of the consiglio di stato has been appealed and that appeal remains pending and iii in any event no interest should be payable on april 29 2012 law no 44 of 2012 442012 came into effect changing the method to calculate the drawback alcoa believes that under 442012 its range of reasonably possible loss is from 0 to 50 million €39 million following the effectiveness of 442012 alcoa has received no further demands from ccse at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter 

european commission matters 

as previously reported in july 2006 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy to some energyintensive industries complies with european union eu state aid rules the italian power tariff extended the tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 alcoa has been incurring higher power costs at its smelters in italy subsequent to the tariff end date the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 prior to expiration of the tariff in 2005 alcoa had been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government the ec’s announcement expressed concerns about whether italy’s extension of the tariff beyond 2005 was compatible with eu legislation and potentially distorted competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs 

on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and therefore the italian government is to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest the amount of this recovery will be based on a calculation that 

  

is being prepared by the italian government see below in late 2009 after discussions with legal counsel and reviewing the bases on which the ec decided including the different considerations cited in the ec decision regarding alcoa’s two smelters in italy alcoa recorded a charge of 250 million €173 million which included 20 million €14 million to write off a receivable from the italian government for amounts due under the now expired tariff structure and 230 million €159 million to establish a reserve on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal of this decision with the general court of the eu alcoa will pursue all substantive and procedural legal steps available to annul the ec’s decision on may 22 2010 alcoa also filed with the general court a request for injunctive relief to suspend the effectiveness of the decision but on july 12 2010 the general court denied such request on september 10 2010 alcoa appealed the july 12 2010 decision to the european court of justice ecj this appeal was dismissed on december 16 2011 

in june 2012 alcoa received formal notification from the italian government with a calculated recovery amount of 375 million €303 million this amount was reduced by 65 million €53 million of amounts owed by the italian government to alcoa resulting in a net payment request of 310 million €250 million in a notice published in the official journal of the european union on september 22 2012 the ec announced that it had filed an action against the italian government on july 18 2012 to compel it to collect the recovery amount on september 27 2012 alcoa received a request for payment in full of the 310 million €250 million by october 31 2012 since then alcoa has been in discussions with the italian government regarding the timing of such payment alcoa commenced payment of the requested amount in five quarterly installments of 66 million €50 million paying the first installment on october 31 2012 it is possible that alcoa may be required to accelerate payment or pay in a lump sum notwithstanding the payment request or the timing of such payments alcoa’s estimate of the most probable loss of the ultimate outcome of this matter and the low end of the range of reasonably possible loss which is 209 million €159 million to 375 million €303 million remains the 209 million €159 million the us dollar amount reflects the effects of foreign currency movements since 2009 recorded in november 2009 at december 31 2012 alcoa’s reserve for this matter stands at 143 million €109 million reflecting the payment made in october 2012 the full extent of the loss will not be known until the final judicial determination which could be a period of several years 

separately on november 29 2006 alcoa filed an appeal before the general court formerly the european court of first instance seeking the annulment of the ec’s decision to open an investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules on march 25 2009 the general court denied alcoa’s appeal on may 29 2009 alcoa appealed the march 25 2009 ruling before the ecj the hearing of the may 29 2009 appeal was held on june 24 2010 on july 21 2011 the ecj denied alcoa’s appeal 

as previously reported in january 2007 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules at the time the ec opened its investigation alcoa had been operating in spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies the investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the ec with respect to the energyintensive consumers the ec opened the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than a pool price mechanism therefore being in principle artificially below market conditions alcoa submitted comments in which the company provided evidence that prices paid by energyintensive consumers were in line with the market in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in the tariff system while alcoa does not believe that an unfavorable decision is probable management has estimated that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision could be approximately 90 million €70 million pretax also while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005 it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts 

  

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites the most significant of these matters including the remediation of the grasse river in massena ny are discussed in the environmental matters section of note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on pages 119120 

as previously reported representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources trustees have asserted that alcoa and reynolds metals company reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa’s and reynolds’ operations at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal proceedings have not been instituted the company has continued to actively investigate these claims pursuant to an agreement entered into with the trustees in 1991 alcoa and reynolds had been working cooperatively with general motors corporation which is facing similar claims by the trustees to assess potential injuries to natural resources in the region with the bankruptcy of general motors in 2009 motors liquidation company mlc took over general motors’ liability in this matter in september 2009 mlc notified alcoa and the trustees that it would no longer participate in the cooperative process alcoa and the trustees agreed to continue to work together cooperatively without mlc to resolve alcoa’s and reynolds’ natural resources damages liability in this matter in january 2011 the trustees representing the united states the state of new york and the mohawk tribe and alcoa reached an agreement in principle to resolve the natural resource damage claims the parties have now finalized a consent decree which is in the process of being executed once fully executed the consent decree will need to be approved by the federal court following a minimum 30day public comment period 

as previously reported in august 2005 dany lavoie a resident of baie comeau in the canadian province of québec filed a motion for authorization to institute a class action and for designation of a class representative against alcoa canada ltd alcoa limitée societe canadienne de metaux reynolds limitée and canadian british aluminum in the superior court of québec in the district of baie comeau plaintiff seeks to institute the class action on behalf of a putative class consisting of all past present and future owners tenants and residents of baie comeau’s st georges neighborhood he alleges that defendants as the present and past owners and operators of an aluminum smelter in baie comeau have negligently allowed the emission of certain contaminants from the smelter specifically polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or “pahs” that have been deposited on the lands and houses of the st georges neighborhood and its environs causing damage to the property of the putative class and causing health concerns for those who inhabit that neighborhood plaintiff originally moved to certify a class action sought to compel additional remediation to be conducted by the defendants beyond that already undertaken by them voluntarily sought an injunction against further emissions in excess of a limit to be determined by the court in consultation with an independent expert and sought money damages on behalf of all class members in may 2007 the court authorized a class action suit to include only people who suffered property damage or personal injury damages caused by the emission of pahs from the smelter in september 2007 the plaintiff filed his claim against the original defendants which the court had authorized in may alcoa has filed its statement of defense and plaintiff has filed an answer to that statement alcoa also filed a motion for particulars with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiff’s answer and a motion to strike with respect to certain paragraphs of plaintiff’s answer in late 2010 the court denied these motions while no further formal proceedings have occurred alcoa has reviewed technical data provided by the plaintiffs and is preparing to provide its own analysis to the plaintiffs the action continues in the discovery phase the plaintiffs have not quantified the damages sought without such amount and given the various damages alleged at this stage of the proceeding the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

as previously reported in january 2006 in musgrave v alcoa et al warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601ct0006 alcoa inc and a subsidiary were sued by an individual on behalf of himself and all persons similarly situated claiming harm from alleged exposure to waste that had been disposed in designated pits at 

  

the squaw creek mine in the 1970s during february 2007 class allegations were dropped and the matter proceeded as an individual claim alcoa filed a renewed motion to dismiss arguing that the claims are barred by the indiana workers’ compensation act amended its answer to include indiana’s recreational use statute as an affirmative defense and filed a motion for summary judgment based on the recreational use statute the court granted alcoa’s motion to dismiss regarding plaintiffs’ occupationallyrelated claims and denied the motion regarding plaintiffs’ recreationallyrelated claims on january 17 2012 the court denied all outstanding motions with no opinion issued a jury trial commenced on april 10 2012 and on may 1 2012 the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants alcoa inc and its subsidiary the court entered its judgment on may 14 2012 on may 31 2012 plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal plaintiffs’ brief was filed on january 25 2013 alcoa’s response is due by march 29 all subsequent briefing replies are to be completed by april 2 2013 

also as previously reported in october 2006 in barnett et al v alcoa and alcoa fuels inc warrick circuit court county of warrick indiana 87c010601pl499 fortyone plaintiffs sued alcoa inc and a subsidiary asserting claims similar to the musgrave matter discussed above in november 2007 alcoa inc and its subsidiary filed motions to dismiss both the musgrave and barnett cases in october 2008 the warrick county circuit court granted alcoa’s motions to dismiss dismissing all claims arising out of alleged occupational exposure to wastes at the squaw creek mine but in november 2008 the trial court clarified its ruling indicating that the order does not dispose of plaintiffs’ personal injury claims based upon alleged “recreational” or nonoccupational exposure plaintiffs also filed a “second amended complaint” in response to the court’s orders granting alcoa’s motions to dismiss on july 7 2010 the court granted the parties’ joint motions for a general continuance of trial settings discovery in this matter is stayed pending the outcome of the musgrave matter the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss because plaintiffs have merely alleged that their medical condition is attributable to exposure to materials at the squaw creek mine but no further information is available due to the discovery stay 

as previously reported in 1996 alcoa acquired the fusina italy smelter and rolling operations and the portovesme italy smelter both of which are owned by alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl from alumix an entity owned by the italian government alcoa also acquired the extrusion plants located in feltre and bolzano italy at the time of the acquisition alumix indemnified alcoa for preexisting environmental contamination at the sites in 2004 the italian ministry of environment moe issued orders to alcoa trasformazioni srl and alumix for the development of a cleanup plan related to soil contamination in excess of allowable limits under legislative decree and to institute emergency actions and pay natural resource damages on april 5 2006 alcoa trasformazioni srl’s fusina site was also sued by the moe and minister of public works mopw in the civil court of venice for an alleged liability for environmental damages in parallel with the orders already issued by the moe alcoa trasformazioni srl appealed the orders defended the civil case for environmental damages which is still pending and filed suit against alumix as discussed below similar issues also existed with respect to the bolzano and feltre plants based on orders issued by local authorities in 2006 all the orders have been challenged in front of the administrative regional courts and all trials are still pending however in bolzano the municipality of bolzano withdrew the order and the regional administrative tribunal of veneto suspended the order in feltre most if not all of the underlying activities occurred during the ownership of alumix the governmental entity that sold the italian plants to alcoa 

as noted above in response to the 2006 civil suit by the moe and mopw alcoa trasformazioni srl filed suit against alumix claiming indemnification under the original acquisition agreement but brought that suit in the court of rome due to jurisdictional rules the court of rome has appointed an expert to assess the causes of the pollution in june 2008 the parties alcoa and now ligestra srl ligestra the successor to alumix signed a preliminary agreement by which they have committed to pursue a settlement and asked for a suspension of the technical assessment during the negotiations the court of rome accepted the request and postponed the technical assessment reserving its ability to fix the deadline depending on the development of negotiations alcoa and ligestra agreed to a settlement in december 2008 with respect to the feltre site ligestra paid the sum of 108 million euros and alcoa committed to clean up the site further postponements were granted by the court of rome and the next hearing was fixed for november 2011 the trial was then suspended under the joint request of the parties and was to be restarted in 2012 the parties applied for a new postponement that was granted by the court and a new hearing was fixed for 

  

december 3 2013 in the meantime in december 2009 alcoa trasformazioni srl and ligestra reached an initial agreement for settlement of the liabilities related to fusina the settlement would also allow alcoa to settle the 2006 civil suit by the moe and mopw for the environmental damages pending before the civil court of venice the agreement outlines an allocation of payments to the moe for emergency action and natural resource damages and the scope and costs for a proposed soil remediation in february 2011 a further and more detailed settlement relating to fusina was reached allocating 80 and 20 of the remediation costs to ligestra and alcoa respectively later in 2011 alcoa and ligestra signed a similar agreement relating to the portovesme site the agreements are contingent upon final acceptance of the remediation project by the moe a proposed soil remediation project for portovesme was formally presented to the moe in june 2012 to provide time for settlement with ligestra the minister of environment and alcoa jointly requested and the civil court of venice has granted a series of postponements of hearings in the venice trial assuming that the case will be closed the last hearing was fixed for march 25 2013 alcoa is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss beyond what is described in footnote n for several reasons first the moe has not yet approved the remediation plans the company understands that the moe has substantial discretion in defining what must be managed under the italian soils law the availability of appropriate landfills must also be considered as well as the nature of these sites as a result the scope and cost of the final remediation plans remain uncertain secondly in the case in which the plan is not approved and the settlement with ligestra becomes void alcoa should be held responsible only for its share of pollution but the area is impacted by many sources of pollution as well as historical pollution consequently the allocation of liabilities would need a very complex technical evaluation by the authorities that has not yet been performed 

as previously reported on november 30 2010 alcoa alumínio sa alumínio received service of a lawsuit that had been filed by the public prosecutors of the state of pará in brazil in november 2009 the suit names the company and the state of pará which through its environmental agency had issued the operating license for the company’s new bauxite mine in juruti   the suit concerns the impact of the project on the region’s water system and alleges that certain conditions of the original installation license were not met by the company in the lawsuit plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction suspending the operating license and ordering payment of compensation on april 14 2010 the court denied plaintiffs’ request alumínio presented its defense in march 2011 on grounds that it was in compliance with the terms and conditions of its operating license which included plans to mitigate the impact of the project on the region’s water system in april 2011 the state of pará defended itself in the case asserting that the operating license contains the necessary plans to mitigate such impact that the state monitors the performance of aluminio’s obligations arising out of such license that the licensing process is valid and legal and that the suit is meritless the company’s position is that any impact from the project had been fully repaired when the suit was filed the company also believes that jará lake has not been affected by any project activity and any evidence of pollution from the project would be unreliable following the preliminary injunction the plaintiffs have taken no further action the company is not certain whether or when the action will proceed given that this proceeding is in its preliminary stage and the current uncertainty in this case the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

as previously reported by an amended complaint filed april 21 2005 alcoa global fasteners inc was added as a defendant in orange county water district ocwd v northrop corporation et al civil action 04cc00715 superior court of california county of orange ocwd alleges contamination or threatened contamination of a drinking water aquifer by alcoa certain of the entities that preceded alcoa at the same locations as property owners andor operators and other current and former industrial and manufacturing businesses that operated in orange county in past decades ocwd seeks to recover the cost of aquifer remediation and attorney’s fees trial on statutory nonjury claims commenced on february 10 2012 and continued through september 2012 when the case was submitted to the court for decision on december 11 2012 the court issued its tentative ruling in the matter dismissing plaintiff ocwd’s remaining statutory claims against all defendants the court’s tentative ruling also invited further briefing on the decision and it is subject to modification on january 21 2013 defendants filed a joint brief responding to ten specific questions posed by the court’s tentative ruling the joint brief argued that the court should make further findings of fact and law in favor of the defendants in response to the ten questions alcoa global fasteners inc also filed a separate brief on two of the questions arguing that the court should determine that it is neither a cause of ground water contamination nor a cause of plaintiffs’ incurred costs a hearing is scheduled on february 28 2013 a final decision 

  

will be announced thereafter remaining in the case at this time are common law trespass and nuisance claims for a phase 2 trial which has not been scheduled ocwd has asserted a total remedy cost of at least 150 million plus attorneys’ fees however the amount in controversy at this stage is limited to sums already expended by the ocwd approximately 4 million the court has indicated that it is not likely to grant the ocwd’s request for declaratory relief as to future sums the ocwd expends alcoa believes that it is not responsible for any contamination as alleged in the complaint or that if any liability were to be established its liability would be insignificant while the court has issued a tentative decision on the statutory claims it is not possible at this time to reasonably predict the court’s final determination as to this stage of the proceedings nor any claims presented to a jury in the future nor the impact of claims presented against third party defendants and it is therefore not possible to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss for this matter a similar matter orange county water district v sabic et al civil action 30200800078246 superior court of california county of orange was filed against alcoa global fasteners inc on june 23 2008 this matter also alleges contamination or threatened contamination of a drinking water aquifer by alcoa and others a trial has been set for 2013 alcoa believes that it is not responsible for any contamination as alleged in the complaint or that if any liability were to be established its liability would be insignificant plaintiff orange county water district has made a statutory settlement demand to alcoa and other similar demands to certain other defendants the demand to alcoa is 25 million and is being evaluated

abednego  as previously reported on january 14 2010 alcoa was served with a complaint involving approximately 2900 individual persons claimed to be residents of st croix who are alleged to have suffered personal injury or property damage from hurricane georges or winds blowing material from the property since the time of the hurricane this complaint abednego et al v alcoa et al was filed in the superior court of the virgin islands st croix division the complaint names as defendants the same entities as were sued in the february 1999 action earlier described and have added as a defendant the current owner of the alumina facility property in february 2010 alcoa and sca removed the case to the federal court for the district of the virgin islands subsequently plaintiffs filed motions to remand the case to territorial court as well as a third amended complaint and defendants have moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted on march 17 2011 the court granted plaintiffs’ motion to remand to territorial court thereafter alcoa filed a motion for allowance of appeal the motion was denied on may 18 2011 the parties await assignment of the case to a trial judge

other contingencies 

in addition to the matters discussed above various other lawsuits claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against alcoa including those pertaining to environmental product liability safety and health and tax matters while the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist therefore it is possible that the company’s liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters however based on facts currently available management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect individually or in the aggregate on the financial position of the company

management review of 2012 and outlook for the future 

at the end of 2011 management had projected growth in global aluminum demand of 7 for 2012 in the first half of the year demand was on course however a slowdown in growth in china in the second half resulted in an actual growth rate of 6 additionally lme pricing levels declined on average 16 yearoveryear mainly due to macroeconomic events including significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many european countries and the us fiscal cliff the company also faced significant headwinds for certain costs including maintenance supplies and services labor especially in emerging markets transportation costs mostly fuel oil and higher pension costs consequently the 2012 operating results of the company’s upstream businesses declined compared with 2011 partially offsetting this decrease was the company’s midstream and downstream businesses achieving their highest profitability ever driven by net productivity improvements and higher volumes management continued its relentless focus on liquidity and cash flows generating incremental improvements in procurement efficiencies overhead rationalization working capital and disciplined capital spending these actions enabled alcoa to decrease debt while maintaining a stable level of cash on hand

 in 2013 management is projecting continued growth increase of 7 in the global consumption of primary aluminum consistent with that of 2012 all regions except north america are expected to have onetothree percentage point increases in aluminum demand over 2012 with china 11 and india 9 expected to have the highest growth rates in 2013 however added production along with few industrywide capacity curtailments will result in supply slightly exceeding demand for primary aluminum for alumina growth in global consumption is estimated to be 9 and overall demand is expected to slightly exceed supply management also anticipates improved market conditions for aluminum products in all major global end markets particularly aerospace despite declines in certain regions relative to input costs labor and maintenance expenses will continue to be a challenge however management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2013 

 

  

  

 looking ahead over the next one to three years management will continue to focus on its aggressive strategic targets established two years ago these targets include lowering alcoa’s refining and smelting operations on the cost curve to the 23rd from 30th and 41st from 51st percentiles respectively by 2015 and driving revenue growth in the 

  

midstream increase of 2500 and downstream increase of 1600 operations by 2013 in conjunction with the revenue targets management is committed to improving margins that will exceed historical levels in the midstream and downstream operations management has made significant progress on these targets as described below 

in 2012 actions taken to improve alcoa’s position on the cost curve for both refining and smelting operations included production curtailments of 390 kmt of the atlantic refinery system the creep of lowcost capacity at the refineries in australia full or partial curtailment of 240 kmt of smelting capacity in europe and the permanent closure of 291 kmt of smelting capacity in the us the near fullstartup of the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil and new energy contracts for two us smelters additionally the aluminum complex in saudi arabia continues to be on target as first production from the smelter occurred in december 2012 and the mine and refinery are expected to commence in 2014 at december 31 2012 alcoa’s refining operations were in the 30th percentile and smelting operations were in the 47th percentile a fourpercentage point improvement on the respective cost curves 

the midstream and downstream operations both achieved margins that exceeded historical levels for the second year in a row and are making progress against the respective revenue growth targets the midstream operations will continue to build on this success in 2013 through expansion of the rolling facilities in davenport ia to meet rising us automotive demand due to changing emissions regulations and volume growth in russia and china including emerging markets like consumer electronics the downstream operations will extend their profitable growth in 2013 through continued innovative solutions to meet a widerange of customer needs as well as expansion of aluminum lithium capabilities in lafayette in to meet the growing demand in the aerospace market and the opening of a forged wheels facility in suzhou china that will serve the commercial transportation market 

results of operations 

earnings summary 

income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2012 was 191 or 018 per diluted share compared with 614 or 055 per share in 2011 the decline of 423 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following lower realized prices for aluminum and alumina higher input costs and charges for litigation and environmental remediation matters these items were partially offset by net productivity improvements a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets a decline in the results attributable to noncontrolling interests lower restructuring charges net favorable foreign currency movements lower income taxes due to a decline in operating results a favorable lifo last in first out impact and higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments 

income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2011 was 614 or 055 per share compared with 262 or 025 per share in 2010 the improvement of 352 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum stronger volumes in the midstream and downstream segments net productivity improvements and a net favorable change in marktomarket derivative contracts these items were partially offset by higher input costs net unfavorable foreign currency movements higher income taxes due to better operating results and additional restructuring charges 

net income attributable to alcoa for 2012 was 191 or 018 per share compared with 611 or 055 per share in 2011 and 254 or 024 per share in 2010 in 2011 net income of 611 included a loss from discontinued operations of 3 and in 2010 net income of 254 included a loss from discontinued operations of 8 

in 2011 alcoa restarted the following previously curtailed production capacity in the us massena east ny 125 kmtperyear wenatchee wa 43 kmtperyear and ferndale wa intalco 47 kmtperyear 11 kmt more than previously planned these restarts occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers as a result of these restarts aluminum production increased by approximately 150 kmt during 2011 and by 215 kmt in 2012 

  

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the smelter located in tennessee 215 kmtperyear and two potlines capacity of 76 kmtperyear at the smelter located in rockdale tx remaining capacity of 191 kmtperyear composed of four potlines this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme italy 150 kmtperyear avilés spain 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña spain 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear these curtailments were completed by the end of 2012 the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 

in december 2012 the spanish government issued a ministerial order that modified the interruptibility regime previously in place in the spanish power market the interruptibility regime allows certain industrial customers who are willing to be subject to temporary interruptions in the supply of power to sell interruption rights to the high voltage transmission system operator in january 2013 alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell interruption services under the modified regime from its san ciprian avilés and la coruña smelters in spain the commitment is taken for a oneyear period alcoa understands that the spanish government intends to notify the european commission of the modification in the interruptibility regime for review under european state aid rules as a result of the modification to the interruptibility regime alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion 25 kmt combined for avilés and la coruña of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 in order to meet the requirements of the modified interruptibility regime 

sales— sales for 2012 were 23700 compared with sales of 24951 in 2011 a decrease of 1251 or 5 the decline was mainly the result of a drop in realized prices for aluminum and alumina driven by lower london metal exchange lme prices unfavorable pricing in the midstream segment due to a decrease in metal prices and unfavorable foreign currency movements mostly due to a weaker euro somewhat offset by higher volumes in the midstream and downstream segments and favorable product mix in the midstream segment 

sales for 2011 were 24951 compared with sales of 21013 in 2010 an improvement of 3938 or 19 the increase was primarily due to a rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum better pricing in the midstream segment and higher volumes in the primary metals segment and virtually all businesses in the midstream and downstream segments 

cost of goods sold— cogs as a percentage of sales was 864 in 2012 compared with 821 in 2011 the percentage was negatively impacted by the previously mentioned lower realized prices in the upstream and midstream segments higher input costs a net charge for adjustments to certain environmental reserves 194 and a charge for a civil litigation reserve 85 these items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and a change in lifo adjustments from unfavorable to favorable primarily due to lower prices for alumina and metal and lower costs for calcined coke 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 821 in 2011 compared with 817 in 2010 the percentage was negatively impacted by higher energy and raw materials costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar mostly offset by the previously mentioned higher realized prices and net productivity improvements 

selling general administrative and other expenses— sga expenses were 997 or 42 of sales in 2012 compared with 1027 or 41 of sales in 2011 the decline of 30 was mostly due to lower stockbased compensation expense a decrease in bad debt expense see below a decline in travel expense and less spending across various other expenses these items were partially offset by higher pension costs due to the recognition of higher net actuarial losses and increased professional expenses due to consulting fees associated with productivity initiatives and higher legal expenses 

  

sga expenses were 1027 or 41 of sales in 2011 compared with 961 or 46 of sales in 2010 the increase of 66 was principally the result of higher labor costs and an increase in bad debt expense the increase in labor costs was the result of a higher average employee base and a higher cost of employee benefits the higher bad debt expense was caused by charges for anticipated customer credit losses primarily related to those in europe 

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 197 in 2012 compared with 184 in 2011 and 174 in 2010 the increase in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily caused by additional spending related to inert anode technology for the primary metals segment the increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 was mainly driven by incremental increases across various expenses necessary to support rd activities 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1460 in 2012 compared with 1479 in 2011 the decrease of 19 or 1 was principally the result of the cessation of dda due to the decision at the end of 2011 to permanently shut down and demolish the smelter in tennessee see restructuring and other charges below and the absence of dda on various inuse assets that reached the end of their estimated useful life in 2011 partially offset by an increase related to assets placed into service associated with a new hydroelectric power facility in brazil and higher dda due to the capitalization of new haul roads and the writeoff of old haul roads no longer in use for mining sites in australia 

the provision for dda was 1479 in 2011 compared with 1450 in 2010 the increase of 29 or 2 was mostly due to a portion of the assets placed into service in mid2011 related to a new hydroelectric power facility in brazil along with a number of small increases at various locations 

restructuring and other charges— restructuring and other charges for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2012 were comprised of the following 

 

 layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 

2012 actions— in 2012 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 87 73 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 47 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 800 employees 390 in the engineered products and solutions segment 250 in the primary metals segment 85 in the alumina segment and 75 in corporate including 10 7 aftertax for the layoff of an additional 170 employees related to the previously reported smelter curtailments in spain see 2011 actions below 30 30 aftertax in asset impairments and 6 6 aftertax for lease and contract termination costs due to a decision to exit the lithographic sheet business in bohai china 11 11 aftertax in costs to idle the portovesme smelter see 2011 actions below 10 8 aftertax in other asset impairments a net charge of 4 4 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other miscellaneous items and 21 15 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of a number of layoff reserves related to prior periods including 10 7 aftertax related to the smelters in spain the reversal related to the smelters in spain is due to lower than expected costs based on agreements with employee representatives and the government as well as a reduction of 55 in the number of layoffs due to the anticipation of the restart of a portion of the previously curtailed capacity based on an agreement with the spanish government that will provide interruptibility rights ie compensation for power interruptions when grids are overloaded to the smelters during 2013 a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded at the end of 2011 see 2011 actions below and a portion of this reversal relates to layoff costs recorded during 2012 see above 

  

as of december 31 2012 approximately 270 of the 800 employees were separated the remaining separations for the 2012 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2013 in 2012 cash payments of 16 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2012 restructuring programs 

2011 actions— in 2011 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 281 181 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 127 82 aftertax in asset impairments and 36 23 aftertax in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at two us locations see below 93 68 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 1600 employees 820 in the primary metals segment 470 in the global rolled products segment 160 in the alumina segment 20 in the engineered products and solutions segment and 130 in corporate including the effects of planned smelter curtailments see below 23 12 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other asset impairments including the writeoff of the carrying value of an idled structure in australia that processed spent pot lining and adjustments to the fair value of the one remaining foil location while it was classified as held for sale due to foreign currency movements 20 8 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for a litigation matter related to the former st croix location a net charge of 5 4 aftertax for other small items and 23 16 aftertax for the reversal of previously recorded layoff reserves due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances including a change in plans for alcoa’s aluminum powder facility in rockdale tx 

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two us locations each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons the identified facilities are the smelter located in alcoa tn capacity of 215 kmtperyear and two potlines capacity of 76 kmtperyear at the smelter located in rockdale tx remaining capacity of 191 kmtperyear composed of four potlines demolition and remediation activities related to these actions began in 2012 and are expected to be completed in 2015 for the tennessee smelter and in 2013 for the two potlines at the rockdale smelter this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs the asset impairments of 127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties plants and equipment related to these facilities additionally remaining inventories mostly operating supplies were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 6 4 aftertax which was recorded in cost of goods sold on the accompanying statement of consolidated operations the other exit costs of 36 represent 18 11 aftertax in environmental remediation and 17 11 aftertax in asset retirement obligations both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 1 1 aftertax in other related costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme italy 150 kmtperyear avilés spain 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña spain 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear these curtailments were completed by the end of 2012 the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility which would result in future charges while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 as a result of these decisions alcoa recorded costs of 33 31 aftertax for the layoff of approximately 650 employees as alcoa engaged in discussions with the respective employee representatives and governments additional charges were recognized in 2012 see 2012 actions above 

as of december 31 2012 approximately 895 of the 1475 employees were separated the total number of employees associated with the 2011 restructuring programs was updated to reflect changes in plans agreement related to the smelters in spain – see 2012 actions above better than expected operating performance at certain locations and natural attrition the remaining separations for the 2011 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2013 in 2012 and 2011 cash payments of 23 and 24 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to the 2011 restructuring programs 

2010 actions— in 2010 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 207 130 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 127 80 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in 

  

asset impairments and 46 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at five us locations see below 43 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 875 employees 625 in the engineered products and solutions segment 75 in the primary metals segment 60 in the alumina segment 25 in the global rolled products segment and 90 in corporate 22 14 aftertax in net charges including 12 8 aftertax for asset impairments related to divested and to be divested businesses automotive castings global foil transportation products europe and packaging and consumer for among other items the settlement of a contract with a former customer foreign currency movements working capital adjustments and a tax indemnification 2 2 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for various other exit costs and 33 24 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the reversal of prior periods’ layoff reserves including a portion of those related to the portovesme smelter in italy due to the execution of a new power agreement 

in early 2010 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the following structures each of which was previously temporarily idled for different reasons the eastalco smelter located in frederick md capacity of 195 kmtperyear the smelter located in badin nc capacity of 60 kmtperyear an aluminum fluoride plant in point comfort tx a paste plant and cast house in massena ny and one potline at the smelter in warrick in capacity of 40 kmtperyear this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals cost competitiveness other existing idle capacity required future capital investment and restart costs as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs the asset impairments of 127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties plants and equipment related to these facilities additionally remaining inventories mostly operating supplies were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 8 5 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which was recorded in cost of goods sold on the accompanying statement of consolidated operations the other exit costs of 46 represent 30 19 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in asset retirement obligations and 14 9 aftertax in environmental remediation both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 2 1 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in other related costs 

as of december 31 2012 the separations associated with 2010 restructuring programs were essentially complete in 2012 and 2011 cash payments of 3 and 7 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to 2010 restructuring programs 

alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense— interest expense was 490 in 2012 compared with 524 in 2011 the decline of 34 or 6 was principally caused by the absence of a 41 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes see below somewhat offset by lower capitalized interest 8 the decrease in capitalized interest was largely attributable to the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil as construction nears completion partially offset by an increase related to the aluminum complex in saudi arabia 

interest expense was 524 in 2011 compared with 494 in 2010 the increase of 30 or 6 was primarily due to a 41 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes 74 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a 33 gain for “inthemoney” interest rate swaps somewhat offset by the absence of a 14 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes 42 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a 28 gain for “inthemoney” interest rate swaps 

  

other income expenses net— other income net was 341 in 2012 compared with 87 in 2011 the increase of 254 was mostly due to a gain on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets 320 see primary metals in segment information below and net favorable foreign currency movements 21 these two items were somewhat offset by lower equity income 43 largely attributable to alcoa’s share of expenses of the joint venture in saudi arabia and the absence of a discrete income tax benefit recognized by the consortium related to an investment in a natural gas pipeline in australia see below the absence of a gain on the sale of land see below and a net unfavorable change in marktomarket derivative contracts 39 principally driven by the absence of a favorable change in an energy contract that expired in september 2011 

other income net was 87 in 2011 compared with other expenses net of 5 in 2010 the change of 92 was mainly the result of a net favorable change of 89 in marktomarket derivative contracts a gain of 43 from the sale of land in australia and higher equity income from an investment in a natural gas pipeline in australia due to the recognition of a discrete income tax benefit by the consortium alcoa world alumina and chemicals’ share of the benefit was 24 slightly offset by a decrease in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance 

income taxes— alcoa’s effective tax rate was 500 in 2012 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the tax impact from the gain recognized on the sale of us hydroelectric power assets see primary metals in segment information below and an 8 discrete income tax charge related to prior year us taxes on certain depletable assets slightly offset by a 13 discrete income tax benefit related to a change in the legal structure of an investment 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 240 in 2011 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate mainly due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 269 in 2010 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions a 57 discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available a 24 discrete income tax benefit related to a canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in us dollars and a 13 net discrete income tax benefit for various other items partially offset by a 79 discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and a 19 discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities this amount represents a decrease to alcoa’s unrecognized tax benefits 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2013 will be approximately 30 however changes in the current economic environment tax legislation or rate changes currency fluctuations ability to realize deferred tax assets and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law and extended through 2013 various expired or expiring temporary business tax provisions two specific temporary business tax provisions that expired in 2011 and impacted alcoa are the lookthrough rule for payments between related controlled foreign corporations and the research and experimentation credit the expiration of these two provisions resulted in alcoa recognizing a higher income tax provision of 18 in 2012 as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment alcoa will recognize an 18 discrete income tax benefit in 2013 related to the 2012 tax year to reflect the extension of these provisions 

in december 2011 one of the company’s subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations if approved the tax rate for this subsidiary will decrease significantly resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10year holiday period would be effective as of january 1 2013 additionally the net deferred tax asset of the subsidiary would be remeasured at the lower rate in the period the holiday is approved this remeasurement would result in a decrease to the net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of approximately 60 to 120 as of december 31 2012 alcoa’s subsidiary’s application is still pending 

  

noncontrolling interests— net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was 29 in 2012 compared with net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 194 in 2011 the change of 223 was mostly due to lower earnings at alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac which is owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited the decline in earnings at awac were attributed primarily to lower realized prices due to a decrease in contractual lmebased pricing higher input costs particularly caustic and fuel oil and a charge for a litigation reserve of 34 these items were somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 194 in 2011 compared with 138 in 2010 the increase of 56 was largely the result of higher earnings at awac the improved earnings at awac were mainly driven by higher realized prices partially offset by higher input costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 

loss from discontinued operations— loss from discontinued operations in 2011 was 3 comprised of an additional loss of 3 5 pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion divested in june 2009 of the electrical and electronic solutions ees business as a result of a negotiated preliminary settlement related to claims filed in 2010 against alcoa by platinum equity in an insolvency proceeding in germany a net gain of 2 3 pretax related to both the wire harness and electrical portion and the electronics portion divested in december 2009 of the ees business for a number of small postclosing and other adjustments and a 2 2 pretax reversal of the gain recognized in 2006 related to the sale of the home exteriors business for an adjustment to an outstanding obligation which was part of the terms of sale 

loss from discontinued operations in 2010 was 8 comprised of an additional loss of 6 9 pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of 2 4 pretax related to the electronics portion of the ees business for the settling of working capital which was not included in the divestiture transaction 

segment information 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals global rolled products and engineered products and solutions segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges discontinued operations and other items including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 1369 in 2012 1893 in 2011 and 1424 in 2010 see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information the following discussion provides shipments sales and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2012 

alumina 

 

   

this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide refinery system including the mining of bauxite which is then refined into alumina alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products a portion of this segment’s thirdparty sales are completed through the use of agents alumina traders and distributors slightly more than half of alcoa’s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment 

in 2012 alumina production decreased by 144 kmt compared to 2011 the decline was mainly driven by lower production in the atlantic refinery system as a result of management’s plan to reduce annual production capacity by approximately 390 kmt this decision was made to align production with smelter curtailments initiated at the beginning of 2012 and to reflect prevailing market conditions the decrease at these three refineries was partially offset by higher production at the pinjarra and kwinana refineries in australia due to system process improvements 

in 2011 alumina production increased by 564 kmt compared to 2010 the improvement was mostly the result of higher production at the são luís brazil refinery as the rampup of the 2100 kmt expanded capacity the alumina segment’s share is approximately 1100 kmtperyear that began in late 2009 continued through 2011 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment dropped 11 in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily related to a 15 decline in realized prices driven by a decrease in contractual lmebased pricing slightly offset by realized benefits from moving customer contracts to alumina index pricing and from improved spot pricing thirdparty sales for this segment improved 23 in 2011 compared with 2010 largely attributable to a 21 increase in realized prices driven by the movement of customer contracts to alumina index pricing benefits from improved spot prices and improved pricing from lmebased contracts 

intersegment sales for the alumina segment decreased 15 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to lower realized prices and decreased demand from the primary metals segment intersegment sales for this segment climbed 23 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily the result of higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the primary metals segment 

atoi for the alumina segment dropped 517 in 2012 compared with 2011 mostly due to the previously mentioned lower realized prices higher input costs particularly caustic and fuel oil and the absence of a gain on the sale of land in australia 30 somewhat offset by net productivity improvements and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar especially against the brazilian real 

atoi for this segment increased 306 in 2011 compared with 2010 mainly caused by the significant improvement in realized prices and a gain on the sale of land in australia 30 partially offset by considerably higher input costs particularly related to caustic and fuel oil and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar especially against the australian dollar 

in 2013 the continued shift towards alumina index or spot pricing is expected to average 48 of thirdparty sales while those still contractually linked to the lme will follow a 30day lag additionally net productivity improvements are expected to continue 

primary metals 

 

   

this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide smelter system primary metals receives alumina mostly from the alumina segment and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa’s fabricating businesses as well as sold to external customers aluminum traders and commodity markets results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess power are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buyresell activity primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales buyresell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 

in november 2012 alcoa completed the sale of its 351megawatt tapoco hydroelectric project “tapoco” to brookfield renewable energy partners for 597 in cash alcoa recognized a gain of 320 173 aftertax in other income net on the accompanying statement of consolidated operations of which a gain of 426 275 aftertax was reflected in the primary metals segment and a loss of 106 102 aftertax was reflected in corporate the amount in corporate represents the writeoff of goodwill and capitalized interest related to tapoco that were not included in the assets of the primary metals segment tapoco is a fourstation hydroelectric project located on the little tennessee and cheoah rivers in eastern tennessee and western north carolina the transaction included four generating stations and dams 86 miles of transmission lines and approximately 14500 acres of land associated with and surrounding tapoco the power generated by tapoco was primarily consumed by alcoa’s smelter in tennessee which was temporarily idled in 2009 and permanently shut down in 2011 since 2009 the power generated from tapoco was sold into the open market 

at december 31 2012 alcoa had 591 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4227 kmt in 2012 idle capacity decreased 53 kmt compared to 2011 due to the permanent shutdown of the smelter in tennessee 215 kmtperyear and two potlines at the smelter located in rockdale tx 76 kmtperyear mostly offset by the curtailment of the portovesme smelter in italy 150 kmtperyear and the temporarily curtailment of a portion of the smelters in spain avilés 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear additionally base capacity declined 291 kmt between december 31 2012 and 2011 due to the previously mentioned permanent shutdowns 

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the tennessee smelter and two potlines at the rockdale smelter remaining capacity of 191 kmtperyear composed of four potlines each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a full curtailment of the portovesme smelter and a partial curtailment at the avilés and la coruña smelters the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions were the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 

at december 31 2011 alcoa had 644 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4518 kmt in 2011 idle capacity decreased 234 kmt compared to 2010 due to the full restart of previously curtailed production capacity in the us massena east ny 125 kmtperyear wenatchee wa 43 kmtperyear and ferndale wa intalco 47 kmtperyear 11 kmt more than previously planned these restarts occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers as a result of these restarts aluminum production increased by approximately 150 kmt during 2011 and by 215 kmt in 2012 

in 2012 aluminum production decreased by 33 kmt mostly due to the previously mentioned curtailments at the portovesme avilés and la coruña smelters partially offset by the benefit of a full year of production related to the capacity restarted in 2011 at the massena east wenatchee and ferndale smelters in 2011 aluminum production 

  

improved by 189 kmt mainly the result of the previously mentioned restarted capacity at massena east ferndale and wenatchee as well as higher production at the avilés smelter where production had been previously halted due to torrential flooding in 2010 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment dropped 10 in 2012 compared with 2011 mainly due to a 12 decline in average realized prices driven by 16 lower average lme prices slightly offset by higher buyresell activity the us capacity restarted in 2011 contributed positively to thirdparty sales in 2012 but was completely offset by the curtailments of european capacity in 2012 thirdparty sales for this segment improved 17 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a 12 rise in average realized prices driven by 10 higher average lme prices higher volumes largely attributable to the previously mentioned restarted us capacity and increased revenue from the sale of excess power 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment decreased 10 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally due to a decline in realized prices driven by a lower lme intersegment sales for this segment rose 23 in 2011 compared with 2010 mainly the result of an improvement in realized prices driven by the higher lme and an increase in buyresell activity 

atoi for the primary metals segment dropped 172 in 2012 compared with 2011 principally related to the previously mentioned decrease in realized prices higher costs particularly labor and other raw materials and an unfavorable impact as a result of business interruption and repair costs related to a fire in march 2012 at the massena west ny cast house 21 partially offset by a gain on the sale of tapoco see above lower costs for alumina and energy net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar particularly against the euro and brazilian real and net productivity improvements 

atoi for this segment declined 7 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily caused by significantly higher input costs including carbon alumina and energy and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar virtually offset by improved realized prices net productivity improvements and higher excess power sales 

in 2013 pricing is anticipated to follow a 15day lag on the lme and net productivity improvements are expected to continue also alcoa’s share of startup costs for the smelter in saudi arabia will negatively impact results additionally planned maintenance for power plants during the first half of the year and higher energy costs are expected furthermore in january 2013 alcoa applied for and was granted rights to sell power interruption services from its san ciprian avilés and la coruña smelters in spain for a oneyear period as a result alcoa has commenced the restart of a portion 25 kmt combined for avilés and la coruña of the capacity previously curtailed in the first half of 2012 in order to meet the requirements of the interruption services see the earnings summary section above for additional information

liquidity and capital resources 

alcoa maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet in 2012 as in the prior three years management initiated actions to significantly improve alcoa’s cost structure and liquidity providing the company with the ability to operate effectively as the global economy continues to recover from the economic downturn that began in 2008 such actions include procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements and maintaining a sustainable level of capital expenditures in 2013 this approach will continue with the ultimate goal of generating cash from operations that exceeds capital expenditures 

along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa’s current operational and business needs for an analysis of longterm liquidity see contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements

cash from operations 

cash from operations in 2012 was 1497 compared with 2193 in 2011 the decrease of 696 or 32 was primarily due to lower operating results higher pension contributions of 225 and a lower net cash inflow associated with working capital of 36 somewhat offset by a higher cash inflow of 425 in noncurrent liabilities and a positive change of 163 in noncurrent assets 

the higher pension contributions were principally driven by the fact that in 2012 all contributions to the us pension plans were made in cash whereas in 2011 a 600 noncash contribution to the us pension plans was made in the form of company common stock 

the major components of the lower net cash inflow in working capital were as follows a favorable change of 219 in receivables primarily related to fewer uncollected receivables related to sales programs and lower customer sales a positive change of 435 in inventories mostly due to lower levels of onhand alumina and aluminum products and a decrease in the lme price of aluminum a negative change of 74 in prepaid expenses and other current assets largely attributable to the absence of a reduction in collateral posted related to marktomarket derivative contracts and an increase in both excess carbon emission credits and prepayments for natural gas in australia somewhat offset by an income tax refund received for the carryback of a loss from a prior year in canada an unfavorable change of 406 in accounts payable trade principally the result of timing of payments and receipt of vendor invoices a higher outflow of 45 in accrued expenses largely attributable to a payment made to the italian government see below a decrease in deferred revenue the absence of a charge related to the former st croix location somewhat offset by an increase in the litigation reserve 425 – see below and a negative change of 165 in taxes including income taxes mainly due to less income taxes caused by lower operating results 

the higher cash inflow in noncurrent liabilities was primarily caused by an increase in certain environmental reserves of 194 higher accrual for pension plans and an increase in deferred revenue related to a contract to deliver sheet and plate to a customer beginning in 2014 

in june 2012 alcoa received formal notification from the italian government requesting a net payment of 310 €250 related to a november 2009 european commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters alcoa has been in discussions with the italian government regarding the timing of such payment alcoa commenced payment of the requested amount in five quarterly installments of 66 €50 paying the first installment on october 31 2012 it is possible that alcoa may be required to accelerate payment or pay in a lump sum

on october 9 2012 alcoa world alumina llc a majorityowned subsidiary of alcoa paid 425 to the plaintiff of a civil litigation matter pursuant to a settlement agreement another 425 is scheduled to be paid on october 9 2013 

cash from operations in 2011 was 2193 compared with 2261 in 2010 the decline of 68 or 3 was largely attributable to higher pension contributions of 223 a lower net cash inflow associated with working capital of 206 an additional cash outflow of 71 in noncurrent assets and a lower cash inflow of 36 in noncurrent liabilities mostly offset by better operating results 

the higher pension contributions were principally driven by cash contributions made to us pension plans towards maintaining an approximately 80 funded status 

  

the major components of the lower net cash inflow in working capital were as follows an additional outflow of 122 in inventories mostly due to higher production as a result of increased demand and rising input costs a higher inflow of 47 in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily driven by the absence of collateral posted related to a marktomarket energy contract that ended in september 2011 an additional inflow of 66 in accounts payable trade principally the result of higher purchasing needs and timing of vendor payments a lower outflow of 201 in accrued expenses mostly related to fewer cash payments for restructuring programs and the absence of a reduction in collateral held related to marktomarket energy contracts and a smaller inflow of 385 in taxes including income taxes mainly due to the absence of a 347 federal income tax refund for the carryback of alcoa’s 2009 net loss to prior tax years

interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december 31 2012 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2042 the effect of outstanding interest rate swaps which are accounted for as fair value hedges are included in interest related to total debt as of december 31 2012 these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on 200 of debt through 2018 as the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 

estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates among others the minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated to be 460 for 2013 575 for 2014 535 for 2015 465 for 2016 and 445 for 2017 these expected pension contributions reflect the impacts of the pension protection act of 2006 the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 and the moving ahead for progress in the 21 st century act pension contributions are expected to continue to decline if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future other postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate 270 to 285 annually for years 2013 through 2017 and 240 annually for years 2018 through 2022 such payments will be slightly offset by subsidy receipts related to medicare part d which are estimated to be approximately 30 to 35 annually for years 2013 through 2022 alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2017 and 2022 respectively 

layoff and other restructuring payments expected to be paid within one year primarily relate to severance costs amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to lease termination costs special termination benefit payments and ongoing site remediation work 

deferred revenue arrangements require alcoa to deliver alumina and sheet and plate to certain customers over the specified contract period through 2027 for an alumina contract and through 2020 for a sheet and plate contract while these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made 

uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december 31 2012 the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “thereafter” column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires then additional payments will not be necessary 

obligations for financing activities 

total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt including shortterm borrowings and longterm debt maturities for longterm debt extend to 2042 

alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock including dividends on preferred stock alcoa paid 131 in dividends to shareholders during 2012 because all dividends are subject to approval by alcoa’s board of directors amounts are not included in the preceding table unless such authorization has occurred as of december 31 2012 there were 1067211953 and 546024 shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock respectively the annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of 375 per share and the annual common stock dividend is 012 per share 

obligations for investing activities 

capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of december 31 2012 funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects it is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources including cash provided from operations total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 1550 in 2013 

  

equity contributions represent alcoa’s committed investment related to a joint venture in saudi arabia in december 2009 alcoa signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new aluminum complex in saudi arabia comprised of a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill which will require the company to contribute approximately 1100 over a fiveyear period 2010 through 2014 as of december 31 2012 alcoa has made equity contributions of 661 the timing of the amounts included in the preceding table may vary based on changes in anticipated construction schedules of the project 

payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur in connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in russia alcoa could be required to make contingent payments of approximately 50 through 2015 but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard 

offbalance sheet arrangements at december 31 2012 alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of 621 these guarantees expire in 2015 through 2019 and relate to project financing for a hydroelectric power project in brazil and the aluminum complex in saudi arabia alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to tax matters outstanding debt workers compensation environmental obligations energy contracts and customs duties among others the total amount committed under these guarantees which expire at various dates between 2013 and 2017 was 494 at december 31 2012 

alcoa has outstanding letters of credit primarily related to workers’ compensation energy contracts and leasing obligations the total amount committed under these letters of credit which automatically renew or expire at various dates mostly in 2013 was 299 at december 31 2012 alcoa also has outstanding surety bonds primarily related to tax matters contract performance workers compensation environmentalrelated matters and customs duties the total amount committed under these bonds which automatically renew or expire at various dates mostly in 2013 and 2014 was 193 at december 31 2012 

alcoa has three arrangements each with a different financial institution to sell certain customer receivables outright without recourse on a continuous basis as of december 31 2012 sold receivables which were derecognized from the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of 37 under the three arrangements combined were uncollected alcoa services the customer receivables for the financial institutions at market rates therefore no servicing asset or liability was recorded 

on march 30 2012 alcoa finalized a oneyear arrangement with a financial institution to sell certain customer receivables without recourse on a revolving basis the sale of such receivables is completed through the use of a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity which is a consolidated subsidiary of alcoa this arrangement provides for minimum funding of 50 up to a maximum of 250 for receivables sold alcoa initially sold 304 of customer receivables in exchange for 50 in cash and 254 of deferred purchase price under this arrangement alcoa received additional cash funding of 155 throughout 2012 as of december 31 2012 the deferred purchase price receivable was 18 which was included in other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet the deferred purchase price receivable is reduced as collections of the underlying receivables occur however as this is a revolving program the sale of new receivables will result in an increase in the deferred purchase price receivable the net change in the deferred purchase price receivable was reflected in the decrease in receivables line item on the statement of consolidated cash flows this activity is reflected as an operating cash flow because the related customer receivables are the result of an operating activity with an insignificant shortterm interest rate risk in 2012 the gross cash outflows and inflows associated with the deferred purchase price receivable were 3339 and 3321 respectively the gross amount of receivables sold and total cash collections under this program since its inception was 3339 and 3116 respectively alcoa services the customer receivables for the financial institution at market rates therefore no servicing asset or liability was recorded 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for 

  

derivatives and hedging activities environmental and litigation matters asset retirement obligations the testing of goodwill equity investments and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses to be divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

derivatives and hedging derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program for derivatives designated as fair value hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense 

alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing longterm debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges as a result the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense consistent with the underlying hedged item 

alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales cost of goods sold or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures generally not exceeding five years 

if no hedging relationship is designated the derivative is marked to market through earnings 

cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

  

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record an aro for the removal treatment transportation storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks polychlorinated biphenyls various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2012 ranges from less than 1 to 52 per structure 132 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has nine reporting units of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment the primary metals segment the global rolled products segment and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil which is included in corporate almost 90 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs 1160 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1628 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment and primary metals 1748 these amounts include an allocation of corporate’s goodwill 

  

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance for testing goodwill for impairment see the recently adopted accounting guidance section of note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the existing twostep quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test 

in the 2011 fourth quarter in conjunction with management’s annual review of goodwill alcoa early adopted the new guidance as a result alcoa instituted a policy for its annual review of goodwill to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test management will proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill this policy will result in each of the nine reporting units being subjected to the twostep quantitative impairment test at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit this would be 2011 and 2010 in which the estimated fair values of three and nine reporting units respectively were substantially in excess of their carrying values and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2012 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for six reporting units management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the six reporting units were less than their carrying values as such no further analysis was required 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

  

during the 2012 annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for three reporting units as follows the primary metals segment the alumina segment and the global rolled products segment for global rolled products the estimated fair value exceeded carrying value by more than 150 resulting in no impairment for primary metals and alumina the estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by 92 and 74 respectively resulting in no impairment these two reporting units have goodwill of 1748 and 171 respectively in developing the fair value of these reporting units the company estimates future cash flows using lme forward curve pricing and operating cost assumptions management believes are reasonable based on expected and historical performance the following could have a negative impact on the estimated fair values of primary metals and alumina a significant protracted decrease in lme and alumina prices decrease in longterm profitability decrease in the longterm demand for aluminum substantial reductions in alcoa’s end markets and volume assumptions and an increase in discount rates 

as part of the 2012 annual review of goodwill management considered the market capitalization of alcoa’s common stock in relation to the company’s total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2012 the market capitalization of alcoa’s common stock was 9263 while this amount is less than the company’s total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2012 the estimated aggregate fair value of alcoa’s reporting units was substantially in excess of the aforementioned market capitalization amount in management’s judgment the main reason for the difference between alcoa’s market capitalization and total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2012 is significantly lower commodity prices for aluminum management believes these commodity prices are being adversely impacted by turmoil in the macroeconomic environment which do not necessarily reflect aluminum industry fundamentals for example there was and continues to be significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many european countries this uncertainty has affected the liquidity of many companies that either operate or are located in europe although alcoa has not been impacted significantly additionally during 2012 there was great concern over what was labeled the fiscal cliff in the us and a slowdown in the growth of china the combination of this economic uncertainty and the continuing decline in commodity prices caused the price of alcoa’s common stock to remain depressed as a result management believes the quoted market price of alcoa’s common stock does not fully reflect the underlying value of the future aggregate cash flows of the company’s reporting units accordingly management does not believe that the comparison of alcoa’s market capitalization and total shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2012 is an indication that goodwill is impaired 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortia which are accounted for on the equity method the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

  

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking manufacturing transportation insurance and pharmaceutical among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2012 2011 and 2010 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 415 490 and 575 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 475 and either a charge or credit of 19 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fouryear average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forwardlooking returns by asset class as described below 

prior to developing the expected longterm rate of return for calendar year 2009 management focused on historical actual returns annual 10year moving and 20year moving averages when developing this assumption based on that process management utilized 9 for the expected longterm rate of return for several years through 2008 for calendar year 2009 the expected longterm rate of return was reduced to 875 due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn this was supported by the fact that in 2008 the 10year moving average of actual performance fell below 9 for the first time in 20 years although the 20year moving average continued to exceed 9 

for calendar year 2010 management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management’s own judgment management considered this forwardlooking analysis as well as the historical return information and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar 2010 would remain at 875 which was between the 20year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class 

for calendar year 2012 and 2011 management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis based on strategic asset allocation changes and estimates of future returns by asset class management used 850 as its expected longterm rate of return for both years this rate again falls within the range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class 

for calendar year 2013 management used the same methodology as it did for 2012 and 2011 and determined that 850 will be the expected longterm rate of return 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 16 for 2013 

  

in 2012 a net charge of 769 529 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 75 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs in 2011 a net charge of 991 593 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to an 85 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs in 2010 a net charge of 216 138 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive income primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs additionally in 2010 a charge of 2 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility annual forfeiture rate and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

equity grants are issued in january each year as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2012 2011 and 2010 was 67 46 aftertax 83 56 aftertax and 84 57 aftertax respectively of this amount 13 18 and 19 in 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and the company’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to 

  

uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

 kingdom of saudi arabia joint venture 

in december 2009 alcoa and saudi arabian mining company ma’aden entered into an agreement setting forth the terms of a joint venture between them to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the kingdom of saudi arabia in its initial phases the complex will include a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million mtpy an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 18 million mtpy an aluminum smelter with an initial capacity of ingot slab and billet of 740000 mtpy and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380000 mtpy the mill is expected to focus initially on the production of sheet end and tab stock for the manufacture of aluminum cans and potentially other products to serve the construction automotive and other industries 

the refinery smelter and rolling mill will be established within the new industrial zone of ras al khair formerly ras az zawr on the east coast of the kingdom of saudi arabia first production from the aluminum smelter and rolling mill is anticipated in 2013 and first production from the mine and refinery is expected in 2014 

total capital investment is expected to be approximately 108 billion sar 405 billion ma’aden owns a 749 interest in the joint venture alcoa owns a 251 interest in the smelter and rolling mill with the awac group having a 251 interest in the mine and refinery for additional information regarding the joint venture see the equity investments section of note i to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data

 as noted above alcoa and ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves the development of an alumina refinery in the kingdom of saudi arabia initial capacity of the refinery is expected to be 18 million mtpy first production is expected in 2014 for additional information regarding the joint venture see the equity investments section of note i to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

the 21 million mtpy expansion of the alumar consortium alumina refinery in são luís maranhão completed by the end of 2009 has increased the refinery’s nameplate capacity to approximately 35 million mtpy with alcoa’s share of such capacity more than doubling to 189 million mtpy based on its 54 ownership stake through alumínio and awac 

in november 2005 alcoa world alumina llc awa llc and rio tinto alcan inc signed a basic agreement with the government of guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 15 million mtpy alumina refinery in guinea in 2006 the basic agreement was approved by the guinean national assembly and was promulgated into law the basic agreement was originally set to expire in november 2008 but has been extended to november 2012 prefeasibility studies were completed in 2008 additional feasibility study work was completed in 2011 and further activities are planned for 2012 

in september 2006 alcoa received environmental approval from the government of western australia for expansion of the wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 47 million mtpy a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy this approval has a term of 5 years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before alcoa can seek construction approval for the project the project was suspended in november 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure longterm energy supply in western australia these constraints continue and as such the project remains under suspension alcoa is therefore seeking an extension of the 2006 environmental approval for the expansion for a further 5 years with a formal determination expected in spring of 2012 

in 2008 awac signed a cooperation agreement with vietnam national coalminerals industries group vinacomin in which they agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study of the gia nghia bauxite mine and alumina refinery project located in dak nong province in vietnam’s central highlands with first stage capacity expected to be between 10 and 15 million mtpy the cooperation between awac and vinacomin on gia nghia is subject to approval by the government of vietnam if established the gia nghia venture is expected to be 51 owned by vinacomin 40 by awac and 9 by others

consortia in which alumínio participates have received concessions for the pai querê hydropower project in southern brazil alumínio’s share is 35 and the santa isabel hydropower project in northern brazil alumínio’s share is 20 development of these concessions has not yet begun 

europe – electricity 

until december 31 2005 the company purchased electricity for its smelters at portovesme and fusina italy under a power supply structure approved by the european commission ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government in 2005 italy granted an extension of the regulated electricity tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 in july 2006 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy complied with 

  

european union eu state aid rules on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in its investigation stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and ordered the italian government to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal against the decision of the ec with the european general court additionally on may 22 2010 alcoa filed an application for interim measures suspension of decision in connection with the ec at the european general court on july 12 2010 the european general court dismissed the request for interim measures due to lack of urgency alcoa appealed this ruling on september 10 2010 this appeal was dismissed by the european court of justice on december 16 2011 on february 25 2010 the italian government issued a decree law no3 2010 implementing a request from the electrical transmission system operator to reinforce the level of system security on the islands of sicily and sardinia the decree law provides the means for endconsumers to provide and be paid for interruptible services up to december 31 2012 on may 26 2010 the ec ruled that scheme introduced by the decree law to be a “nonaid” alcoa applied for and gained rights to sell this service in sardinia from the portovesme smelter additional details about this matter are in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report on july 29 2010 alcoa reached agreement with a power supplier to enter into a new contract expiring on december 31 2012 this arrangement would have enabled operation of the portovesme smelter through december 31 2012 in january 2012 alcoa announced that it decided to curtail operations at its portovesme smelter this curtailment is expected to be completed in the first half of 2012 this curtailment may lead to the permanent closure of the facility additionally in 2010 the fusina smelter was temporarily curtailed due to high energy costs as of june 30 2010 the fusina smelter was fully curtailed 

alcoa’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that commenced in may 2009 and are due to expire on december 31 2012 prior to the establishment of power supply under the bilateral contracts alcoa was supplied under a regulated power tariff on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa operated in spain for more than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system a decision by the ec has not yet been made if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts due to an uncompetitive energy position combined with rising raw material costs and falling aluminum prices in early january 2012 alcoa announced its intentions to partially and temporarily curtail its la coruña and avilés spain smelters the curtailments are expected to be complete by the first half of 2012 

in march 2009 alcoa and orkla asa exchanged respective stakes in the sapa ab and elkem aluminium ans companies pursuant to the exchange alcoa assumed 100 ownership of the two smelters in norway lista and mosjøen at the end of the first quarter of 2009 these smelters have longterm power arrangements in place which continue until at least 2019 

iceland – electricity 

alcoa’s fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland began operation in 2007 central to those operations is a 40year power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company built the kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter in late 2009 iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries both for a period of three years from 2010 through 2012 one tax is based on energy consumption the other is a prepayment of certain other charges and will be recoverable from 2013 through 2015 

north america – natural gas 

in order to supply its refineries and smelters in the us and canada alcoa generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity and the interstate 

  

pipeline transportation are procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

australia – natural gas 

alcoa of australia aofa holds a 20 equity interest in a consortium that bought the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia aofa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries approximately 85 of aofa’s gas supplies are under longterm contract out to 2020 aofa is progressing multiple supply options to replace expiring contracts including investing directly in projects that have the potential to deliver costbased gas 

patents trade secrets and trademarks 

the company believes that its domestic and international patent trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage the company’s rights under its patents as well as the products made and sold under them are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment the patents owned by alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques alcoa’s business as a whole is not however materially dependent on any single patent trade secret or trademark 

the company has a number of trade secrets mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets the company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits 

the company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served examples include the name “alcoa” and the alcoa symbol for aluminum products howmet metal castings huck ® fasteners kawneer ® building panels and durabright ® wheels with easyclean surface treatments the company’s rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment 

competitive conditions 

alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and nonaluminum businesses competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets price quality and service are the principal competitive factors in alcoa’s markets where aluminum products compete with other materials – such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications magnesium titanium composites and plastics for aerospace and defense applications – aluminum’s diverse characteristics particularly its light weight recyclability and flexibility are also significant factors for alcoa’s segments that market products under alcoa’s brand names brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

research and development 

alcoa a technology leader in the aluminum industry engages in research and development programs that include process and product development and basic and applied research expenditures for research and development rd activities were 184 million in 2011 174 million in 2010 and 169 million in 2009

 item 1a risk factors 

alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed separately in this report the following are the most significant factors that could cause alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

the aluminum industry generally remains highly cyclical and is influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in global economic conditions and aluminum enduse markets demand for our products is sensitive to these fluctuations for example 2011 was a turbulent year in the world economy characterized by an uneven recovery in many regions and prolonged volatility and crisis in others namely europe demand for aluminum started strong at the beginning of the year but weakened in the second half while alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum remain bright the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength pace or sustainability of the economic recovery and the effects of government intervention another major economic downturn a prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business or financial condition or results of operations 

  

marketdriven balancing of global aluminum supply and demand may be disrupted by nonmarket forces or other impediments to production closures 

alcoa and certain other aluminum producers have recently announced independent plans to cut aluminum production capacity for alcoa these decisions were a function of marketdriven factors however the existence of nonmarket forces on global aluminum industry capacity such as political pressures in certain countries to keep jobs or to maintain or further develop industry selfsufficiency may prevent or delay the closure or curtailment of certain producers’ smelters irrespective of their position on the industry cost curve other production cuts may be impeded by longterm contracts to buy power or raw materials persistent industry overcapacity may result in a weak pricing environment and margin compression for aluminum producers including alcoa 

a reduction in demand or a lack of increased demand for aluminum by china europe or a combined number of other countries may negatively impact alcoa’s results 

the aluminum industry’s demand is highly correlated to economic growth the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for commodities including aluminum a sustained slowdown in china’s economic and aluminum demand growth that is not offset by increased aluminum demand growth in other emerging economies such as india brazil and several south east asian countries or the combined slowdown in other markets could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices the european sovereign debt crisis could have an adverse effect on european supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum products 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices 

the price of aluminum is frequently volatile and changes in response to general economic conditions expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories the influence of hedge funds and other financial institutions participating in commodity markets has also increased in recent years contributing to higher levels of price volatility in 2011 the lme price reached a high in excess of 2700 per metric ton and by the end of the year declined to below 2000 per metric ton this decline had a negative impact on alcoa’s results in the second half of the year continued high lme inventories could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum a sustained weak aluminum pricing environment or a deterioration in aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts the following factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects for decreases in commodity or lmelinked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations are affected by changes in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and 

  

smelting locations higher than expected input costs could lead to underperformance alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results are affected by significant lag effects for declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in lmelinked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar euro and norwegian kroner may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies whereas products are generally sold in us dollars 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from its growth projects or streamlining portfolio strategy 

alcoa’s growth projects include the ma’aden joint venture the nowcompleted são luís refinery expansion the greenfield juruti bauxite mine the ongoing estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil and the china and russia growth projects management believes that these projects will be beneficial to alcoa however there is no assurance that these benefits will be realized whether due to unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or other factors or that the remaining construction startup activities and testing on the estreito project will be completed as planned by the targeted completion date 

alcoa has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to streamline and grow its portfolio there can be no assurance that such actions will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or beneficial to alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met in addition acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions successfully alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses or operations including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders 

alcoa may not be able to successfully realize goals established in each of its four business segments or by the dates targeted for such goals 

alcoa has announced targets for each of its four major business segments including the following 

 

  

  

  

 there can be no assurance that all of these initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that alcoa will be able to successfully realize these goals at the targeted levels or by the projected dates 

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future for example in december 2009 alcoa announced that it formed a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex including a bauxite mine alumina 

  

refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill in the kingdom of saudi arabia in 2011 alcoa entered into a memorandum of understanding followed by a letter of intent with china power investment corporation cpi which provides a framework for the creation of a joint venture entity with plans to target growth in the chinese automotive aerospace packaging and consumer electronic markets although the company has in relation to the ma’aden joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances necessarily involve special risks whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the joint venture with ma’aden is subject to risks associated with large infrastructure construction projects including the consequences of noncompliance with the timeline and other requirements under the gas supply arrangements for the joint venture also while financing is in place for the project there can be no guaranteed assurance that the project as a whole will be completed within budget or that the project phases will be completed by their targeted completion dates or that it or alcoa’s other joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

alcoa faces significant competition 

as discussed in part i item 1 business – competitive conditions of this report the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets including some that are subsidized in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

further metals industry consolidation could impact alcoa’s business 

the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted alcoa’s business further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict 

failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings could limit alcoa’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs adversely affect the market price of its existing securities or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

currently alcoa’s longterm debt is rated bbb with stable outlook by standard and poor’s ratings services baa3 with stable outlook by moody’s investors services and bbb with stable outlook by fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating assigned will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of alcoa’s financial strategy a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market price of its securities adversely affect existing financing limit access to the capital or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

  

in addition under the project financings for the joint venture project in the kingdom of saudi arabia a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings below investment grade by at least two rating agencies would require alcoa to provide a letter of credit or fund an escrow account for a portion or all of alcoa’s remaining equity commitment to the joint venture for additional information regarding the project financings see note i to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

alcoa could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under committed credit facilities 

as discussed in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources of this report alcoa has a committed revolving credit facility with financial institutions available for its use for which the company pays commitment fees the facility is provided by a syndicate of several financial institutions with each institution agreeing severally and not jointly to make revolving credit loans to alcoa in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement if one or more of the financial institutions providing the committed credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment the portion of the committed facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to the company 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from the change to index pricing of alumina 

alcoa has implemented a move to a pricing mechanism for alumina based on an index of alumina prices rather than a percentage of the lmebased aluminum price alcoa believes that this change expected to affect approximately 20 of annual contracts coming up for renewal each year will more fairly reflect the fundamentals of alumina including raw materials and other input costs involved there can be no assurance that such index pricing ultimately will be accepted or that such index pricing will result in consistently greater profitability from sales of alumina 

alcoa’s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries and regions outside the us having varying degrees of political and economic risk including china europe guinea russia and the kingdom of saudi arabia among others risks include those associated with sovereign and private debt default political instability civil unrest expropriation nationalization renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements mining leases and permits commercial instability caused by corruption and changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition or operating results 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs 

  

associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws antibribery laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by us sites owned by our predecessors or sites that we may acquire in the future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to several sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

climate change climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia australia’s carbon tax effective in 2012 quebec’s transition to a “cap and trade” system with compliance required in 2013 and european direct emission regulations expected by 2013 alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers or alcoa’s supply chain inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly from changes in costs of goods sold 

  

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

adverse changes in discount rates lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations or level of pension funding contributions in future periods 

alcoa’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense alcoa records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate and the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets the large decline in our funded status in 2008 due to the financial crisis generated significant unrecognized actuarial losses we anticipate that expense in future years will continue to be affected as the unrecognized losses are recognized in earnings in addition alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how alcoa’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement benefits accounting policies see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under note w to the consolidated financial statements—pension and other postretirement benefits although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities alcoa would contribute to the pension plans potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status higher than expected potential contributions due to a further decline in our funded status either by an additional decline in discount rates or a lower than expected investment return on plan assets could adversely affect our cash flows 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

a significant portion of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates while alcoa was successful in renegotiating the master collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers in june 2010 alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate other collective bargaining agreements in the us and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

alcoa’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

alcoa’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company and industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoa’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors and other labor market inadequacies may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

alcoa may not realize expected longterm benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies and deployment of companywide business process models such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a 

  

common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there is no assurance that these initiatives will all be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode and carbothermic technology in addition to multialloy casting processes there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

alcoa’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by reductions in its capital expenditures 

alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in greenfield and brownfield projects and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities for 2012 alcoa has targeted generating positive cash flow from operations that will exceed capital spending insufficient cash generation may negatively impact alcoa’s ability to fund as planned its sustaining and growth capital projects over the long term alcoa’s ability to take advantage of forecasted global demand growth for aluminum may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions and the longterm value of its business could be adversely impacted the company’s position in relation to its competitors may also deteriorate 

alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates if alcoa’s interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions its growth could be constrained any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance further existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

cyber attacks may threaten the integrity of alcoa’s trade secrets and sensitive intellectual property 

the company has identified attempts to gain unauthorized access through the internet to our information systems the purpose of these attempts appears to have been to establish command and control and then export companysensitive data to our knowledge no such attack was ultimately successful however the success of such attacks and the resulting damage may only be clear over time and after intensive analysis should such an attack succeed the impact may be material to the company in terms of lost intellectual property trade secrets product development data and other business development data

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential 

litigation 

as previously reported along with various asbestos manufacturers and distributors alcoa and its subsidiaries as premises owners are defendants in several hundred active lawsuits filed on behalf of persons alleging injury predominantly as a result of occupational exposure to asbestos at various company facilities in addition an alcoa subsidiary company has been named along with a large common group of industrial companies in a pattern complaint where the company’s involvement is not evident since 1999 several thousand such complaints have been filed to date the subsidiary has been dismissed from almost every case that was actually placed in line for trial alcoa its subsidiaries and acquired companies all have had numerous insurance policies over the years that provide coverage for asbestos based claims many of these policies provide layers of coverage for varying periods of time and for varying locations alcoa has significant insurance coverage and believes that its reserves are adequate for its known asbestos exposure related liabilities the costs of defense and settlement have not been and are not expected to be material to the results of operations cash flows and financial position of the company 

  

as previously reported in november 2006 in curtis v alcoa inc civil action no 306cv448 ed tenn a class action was filed by plaintiffs representing approximately 13000 retired former employees of alcoa or reynolds metals company and spouses and dependants of such retirees alleging violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa and the labormanagement relations act by requiring plaintiffs beginning january 1 2007 to pay health insurance premiums and increased copayments and coinsurance for certain medical procedures and prescription drugs plaintiffs alleged these changes to their retiree health care plans violated their rights to vested health care benefits plaintiffs additionally alleged that alcoa had breached its fiduciary duty to plaintiffs under erisa by misrepresenting to them that their health benefits would never change plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief back payment of benefits and attorneys’ fees alcoa had consented to treatment of plaintiffs’ claims as a class action during the fourth quarter of 2007 following briefing and argument the court ordered consolidation of the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction with trial certified a plaintiff class bifurcated and stayed the plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claims struck the plaintiffs’ jury demand but indicated it would use an advisory jury and set a trial date of september 17 2008 in august 2008 the court set a new trial date of march 24 2009 and subsequently the trial date was moved to september 22 2009 in june 2009 the court indicated that it would not use an advisory jury at trial trial in the matter was held over eight days commencing september 22 2009 and ending on october 1 2009 in federal court in knoxville tn before the honorable thomas phillips us district court judge at the conclusion of evidence the court set a posthearing briefing schedule for submission of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by the parties and for replies to the same post trial briefing was submitted on december 4 2009 on march 9 2011 the court issued a judgment order dismissing plaintiffs’ lawsuit in its entirety with prejudice for the reasons stated in its findings of fact and conclusions of law on march 23 2011 plaintiffs filed a motion for clarification andor amendment of the judgment order which seeks among other things a declaration that plaintiffs’ retiree benefits are vested subject to an annual cap and an injunction preventing alcoa prior to 2017 from modifying the plan design to which plaintiffs are subject or changing the premiums and deductibles that plaintiffs must pay also on march 23 2011 plaintiffs filed a motion for award of attorney’s fees and expenses alcoa filed its opposition to both motions on april 11 2011 the time for plaintiffs to appeal from the court’s march 9 2011 judgment will not begin until the court disposes of these motions 

as previously reported on february 27 2008 alcoa inc received notice that aluminium bahrain bsc alba had filed suit against alcoa inc and alcoa world alumina llc collectively “alcoa” and others in the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania the “court” civil action number 08299 styled aluminium bahrain bsc v alcoa inc alcoa world alumina llc william rice and victor phillip dahdaleh the complaint alleges that certain alcoa entities and their agents including victor phillip dahdaleh have engaged in a conspiracy over a period of 15 years to defraud alba the complaint further alleges that alcoa and its employees or agents 1 illegally bribed officials of the government of bahrain and or officers of alba in order to force alba to purchase alumina at excessively high prices 2 illegally bribed officials of the government of bahrain and or officers of alba and issued threats in order to pressure alba to enter into an agreement by which alcoa would purchase an equity interest in alba and 3 assigned portions of existing supply contracts between alcoa and alba for the sole purpose of facilitating alleged bribes and unlawful commissions the complaint alleges that alcoa and the other defendants violated the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico and committed fraud alba’s complaint seeks compensatory consequential exemplary and punitive damages rescission of the 2005 alumina supply contract and attorneys’ fees and costs alba seeks treble damages with respect to its rico claims 

on february 26 2008 alcoa inc had advised the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec that it had recently become aware of these claims had already begun an internal investigation and intended to cooperate fully in any investigation that the doj or the sec may commence on march 17 2008 the doj notified alcoa that it had opened a formal investigation and alcoa has been cooperating with the government 

in response to a motion filed by the doj on march 27 2008 the court ordered the suit filed by alba to be administratively closed and that all discovery be stayed to allow the doj to fully conduct an investigation without the interference and distraction of ongoing civil litigation the court further ordered that the case will be reopened at the close of the doj’s investigation on november 8 2011 at alcoa’s request the court removed the case from administrative stay and ordered alba to file an amended complaint by november 28 2011 and a rico case statement 

  

30 days thereafter for the limited purpose of allowing alcoa to move to dismiss alba’s lawsuit pursuant to the november 8 2011 order briefing on the motion to dismiss is to be completed by march 2012 separately the doj’s and sec’s investigations are ongoing while alcoa has been engaged in dialogue with both the doj and sec it is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss with regard to any of the governmental or private party matters discussed above but such losses may be material in a particular period to alcoa’s results of operations 

as previously reported on july 21 2008 the teamsters local 500 severance fund and the southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority filed a shareholder derivative suit in the civil division of the court of common pleas of allegheny county pennsylvania against certain officers and directors of alcoa claiming breach of fiduciary duty gross mismanagement and other violations this derivative action stems from the civil litigation brought by alba against alcoa awa victor phillip dahdaleh and others and the subsequent investigation of alcoa by the doj and the sec with respect to alba’s claims this derivative action claims that the defendants caused or failed to prevent the matters alleged in the alba lawsuit the director defendants filed a motion to dismiss on november 21 2008 on september 3 2009 a hearing was held on alcoa’s motion and on october 12 2009 the court issued its order denying alcoa’s motion to dismiss but finding that a derivative action during the conduct of the doj investigation and pendency of the underlying complaint by alba would be contrary to the interest of shareholders and therefore stayed the case until further order of the court this derivative action is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

as previously reported on march 6 2009 the philadelphia gas works retirement fund filed a shareholder derivative suit in the civil division of the court of common pleas of philadelphia county pennsylvania this action was brought against certain officers and directors of alcoa claiming breach of fiduciary duty and other violations and is based on the allegations made in the previously disclosed civil litigation brought by alba against alcoa awa victor phillip dahdaleh and others and the subsequent investigation of alcoa by the doj and the sec with respect to alba’s claims this derivative action claims that the defendants caused or failed to prevent the conduct alleged in the alba lawsuit on august 7 2009 the director and officer defendants filed an unopposed motion to coordinate the case with the teamsters local 500 suit described immediately above in the allegheny county common pleas court the allegheny county court issued its order consolidating the case on september 18 2009 thereafter on october 31 2009 the court assigned this action to the commerce and complex litigation division of the allegheny court of common pleas and on november 20 2009 the court granted defendants’ motion to stay all proceedings in the philadelphia gas action until the earlier of the court lifting the stay in the teamsters derivative action or further order of the court in this action this derivative action is in its preliminary stages and the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss 

before 2002 alcoa purchased power in italy in the regulated energy market and received a drawback of a portion of the price of power under a special tariff in an amount calculated in accordance with a published resolution of the italian energy authority energy authority resolution n 2041999 in 2001 the energy authority published another resolution which clarified that the drawback would be calculated in the same manner and in the same amount in either the regulated or unregulated market at the beginning of 2002 alcoa left the regulated energy market to purchase energy in the unregulated market subsequently in 2004 the energy authority introduced regulation no 1482004 which set forth a different method for calculating the special tariff that would result in a different drawback for the regulated and unregulated markets alcoa challenged the new regulation in the administrative court of milan and received a favorable judgment in 2006 following this ruling alcoa continued to receive the power price drawback in accordance with the original calculation method through 2009 when the european commission declared all such special tariffs to be impermissible “state aid” in 2010 the energy authority appealed the 2006 ruling to the consiglio di stato final court of appeal on december 2 2011 the consiglio di stato ruled in favor of the energy authority and against alcoa thus presenting the opportunity for the energy regulators to seek reimbursement from alcoa of an amount equal to the difference between the actual drawback amounts received over the relevant time period and the drawback as it would have been calculated in accordance with regulation 1482004 any such reimbursement would have to be made by way of a separate claim to alcoa from the energy authorities and thus far no such claim has been presented at this time the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome for this matter 

  

european commission matters 

as previously reported in july 2006 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy to some energyintensive industries complies with european union eu state aid rules the italian power tariff extended the tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 alcoa has been incurring higher power costs at its smelters in italy subsequent to the tariff end date the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 prior to expiration of the tariff in 2005 alcoa had been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government the ec’s announcement expressed concerns about whether italy’s extension of the tariff beyond 2005 was compatible with eu legislation and potentially distorted competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs 

on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and therefore the italian government is to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest the amount of this recovery will be based on a calculation that is being prepared by the italian government pending formal notification from the italian government alcoa estimates that a payment in the range of 300 to 500 million will be required the timing of such payment is uncertain in late 2009 after discussions with legal counsel and reviewing the bases on which the ec decided including the different considerations cited in the ec decision regarding alcoa’s two smelters in italy alcoa recorded a charge of 250 million including 20 million to write off a receivable from the italian government for amounts due under the now expired tariff structure on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal of this decision with the general court of the eu alcoa will pursue all substantive and procedural legal steps available to annul the ec’s decision on may 22 2010 alcoa also filed with the general court a request for injunctive relief to suspend the effectiveness of the decision but on july 12 2010 the general court denied such request on september 10 2010 alcoa appealed the july 12 2010 decision to the european court of justice ecj this appeal was dismissed on december 16 2011 

on march 23 2011 the ec announced that it has decided to refer the italian government to the ecj for failure to comply with the ec’s november 19 2009 decision 

separately on november 29 2006 alcoa filed an appeal before the general court formerly the european court of first instance seeking the annulment of the ec’s decision to open an investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules on march 25 2009 the general court denied alcoa’s appeal on may 29 2009 alcoa appealed the march 25 2009 ruling before the ecj the hearing of the may 29 2009 appeal was held on june 24 2010 on july 21 2011 the ecj denied alcoa’s appeal 

as previously reported in january 2007 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules at the time the ec opened its investigation alcoa had been operating in spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies the investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the ec with respect to the energyintensive consumers the ec opened the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than a pool price mechanism therefore being in principle artificially below market conditions alcoa submitted comments in which the company provided evidence that prices paid by energyintensive consumers were in line with the market in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in the tariff system while alcoa does not believe that an unfavorable decision is probable management has estimated that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision could be approximately 90 million €70 million pretax also while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be 

  

assessed for the year 2005 it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts 

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites the most significant of these matters including the remediation of the grasse river in massena ny are discussed in the environmental matters section of note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on pages 114117

as previously reported in 1996 alcoa acquired the fusina italy smelter and rolling operations and the portovesme italy smelter both of which are owned by alcoa’s subsidiary alcoa trasformazioni srl from alumix an entity owned by the italian government alcoa also acquired the extrusion plants located in feltre and bolzano italy at the time of the acquisition alumix indemnified alcoa for preexisting environmental contamination at the sites in 2004 the italian ministry of environment moe issued orders to alcoa trasformazioni srl and alumix for the development of a cleanup plan related to soil contamination in excess of allowable limits under legislative decree and to institute emergency actions and pay natural resource damages on april 5 2006 alcoa trasformazioni srl’s fusina site was also sued by the moe and minister of public works mopw in the civil court of venice for an alleged liability for environmental damages in parallel with the orders already issued by the moe alcoa trasformazioni srl appealed the orders defended the civil case for environmental damages which is still pending and filed suit against alumix as discussed below similar issues also existed with respect to the bolzano and feltre plants based on orders issued by local authorities in 2006 all the orders have been challenged in front of the administrative regional courts and all trials are still pending however in bolzano the municipality of bolzano withdrew the order and the regional administrative tribunal of veneto suspended the order in feltre most if not all of the underlying activities occurred during the ownership of alumix the governmental entity that sold the italian plants to alcoa

overview 

our business 

alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina combined through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology mining refining smelting fabricating and recycling aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily based on market supply and demand aluminum and alumina represent more than 80 of alcoa’s revenues and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft automobiles commercial transportation packaging building and construction oil and gas defense consumer electronics and industrial applications 

  

alcoa is a global company operating in 31 countries based upon the country where the point of sale occurred the us and europe generated 49 and 27 respectively of alcoa’s sales in 2011 in addition alcoa has investments and operating activities in among others australia brazil china guinea iceland russia and saudi arabia all of which present opportunities for substantial growth governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates affect the results of operations in these countries 

management review of 2011 and outlook for the future 

at the end of 2010 management had projected growth in global aluminum demand of 12 for 2011 while demand started strong in the year it weakened in the second half resulting in an estimated actual growth rate of 10 additionally lme pricing levels declined steadily from the peak reached in mid2011 resulting in a more than 27 decrease by the end of the year the company also faced demand destruction for aluminum end products in europe and significant headwinds for certain input costs during 2011 despite these challenges the 2011 financial results of alcoa improved over 2010 due in large part to the decisions made by management at the beginning of 2011 management continued its previous actions from its twoyear cash sustainability program which began in 2009 to achieve targets related to procurement efficiencies overhead rationalization and working capital improvements additionally management planned to further improve alcoa’s liquidity position by maintaining a consistent level of capital expenditures with that of 2010 refinancing longterm debt set to mature during 2013 and contributing equity to satisfy a large portion of the company’s 2011 obligation to its us pension plans 

the following financial information reflects some key metrics of alcoa’s 2011 results 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 management is projecting continued growth increase of 7 in the global consumption of primary aluminum in 2012 but at a slower pace than 2011 china and india are expected to have doubledigit increases in aluminum demand while russia and brazil are expected to have 4 to 5 increases in aluminum consumption rates such growth along with industrywide capacity curtailments will result in demand exceeding supply for primary aluminum for alumina growth in global consumption is estimated to be 9 and overall supply and demand are expected to be balanced management also anticipates improved market conditions for aluminum products in most major global end markets particularly aerospace and automotive on the cost side energy prices and certain raw materials are expected to continue to be a challenge management has established and is committed to achieving the following specific goals in 2012 

 

  

  

   

looking ahead over the next two to four years management will continue to focus on its aggressive strategic targets established at the end of 2010 these targets include lowering alcoa’s refining and smelting operations on the cost curve to the 23rd from 30th and 41st from 51st percentiles respectively by 2015 and driving revenue growth in the midstream increase of 2500 and downstream increase of 1600 operations by 2013 in conjunction with the revenue targets management is committed to improving margins that will exceed historical levels in the midstream and downstream operations in 2011 production significantly improved at the juruti bauxite mine development nameplate capacity was achieved for the são luís refinery expansion and a part of the estreito hydroelectric power project became operational these developments along with the planned full or partial curtailment of 240 kmt of smelting capacity in europe and the full startup of estreito both expected to occur in 2012 and the completion of the aluminum complex in saudi arabia by 2014 will help improve the company’s position on the cost curve the midstream and downstream operations both achieved margins that exceeded historical levels and approximately 50 of the respective revenue growth targets in 2011 the midstream operations will continue to build on this success in 2012 through continued volume growth in russia and china including emerging markets like consumer electronics and expansion of the rolling mill in davenport ia to meet rising us automotive demand due to changing emissions regulations the downstream operations will further their accomplishments in 2012 through continued innovative solutions to meet a widerange of customer needs 

results of operations 

earnings summary 

income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2011 was 614 or 055 per diluted share compared with 262 or 025 per share in 2010 the improvement of 352 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum stronger volumes in the midstream and downstream segments net productivity improvements and a net favorable change in marktomarket derivative contracts partially offset by higher input costs net unfavorable foreign currency movements higher income taxes due to better operating results and additional restructuring charges 

income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2010 was 262 or 025 per share compared with a loss from continuing operations of 985 or 106 per share in 2009 the improvement of 1247 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following increases in realized prices for alumina and aluminum ongoing net costs savings and productivity improvements across all segments and the absence of both a charge associated with a european commission electricity pricing matter in italy and a loss on the sale of an equity investment partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements higher energy costs unfavorable changes in lifo last in first out inventories additional depreciation charges and operating costs for growth projects and the absence of gains on the exchange of equity interests and on the acquisition of bauxite and refinery interests 

net income attributable to alcoa for 2011 was 611 or 055 per share compared with net income of 254 or 024 per share in 2010 and a net loss of 1151 or 123 per share in 2009 in 2011 net income of 611 included a loss from discontinued operations of 3 and in 2010 and 2009 net income of 254 and net loss of 1151 included a loss from discontinued operations of 8 and 166 respectively 

in march 2009 management initiated a series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve alcoa’s cost structure and liquidity operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from 017 per share to 003 per share which began with the dividend paid on may 25 2009 and the issuance of 1725 million shares of common stock and 575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded 1438 in net proceeds in january 2010 management initiated further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in 2009 but to improve on them throughout 2010 also a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa’s alumina and aluminum products in 2011 management continued its previous actions to maintain the achieved procurement and overhead savings from the past two years and to further improve cash with working capital initiatives additionally maintaining a level of capital expenditures consistent with that of 2010 was planned during 2012 management plans to continue the actions from 

  

the past three years to achieve additional procurement and overhead savings to further improve on working capital and to maintain a consistent level of capital expenditures 

in late 2008 management made the decision to reduce alcoa’s aluminum and alumina production in response to the then global economic downturn as a result of this decision reductions of 750 kmt or 18 of annualized output from alcoa’s global smelting system were implemented includes previous curtailment at rockdale tx in june 2008 accordingly reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by 1500 kmtperyear across the global refining system the aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early 2009 as planned smelters in rockdale 267 kmtperyear and tennessee 215 kmtperyear were fully curtailed while another 268 kmtperyear was partially curtailed at various other locations the refinery in point comfort tx was partially curtailed by approximately 1500 kmtperyear between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 384 kmtperyear remains curtailed as of december 31 2011 in mid2009 further action became necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the massena east ny smelter 125 kmtperyear and partially curtail the suralco suriname refinery 870 kmtperyear 793 kmtperyear remains curtailed as of december 31 2011 

in 2011 alcoa restarted the following previously curtailed production capacity in the us massena east 125 kmtperyear wenatchee wa 43 kmtperyear and ferndale wa intalco 47 kmtperyear 11 kmt more than previously planned these restarts increased aluminum production by approximately 150 kmt during 2011 and are expected to increase aluminum production by 215 kmt on an annual basis in 2012 and beyond and occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the smelter located in tennessee and two potlines capacity of 76 kmtperyear at the smelter located in rockdale four potlines remain this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme italy 150 kmtperyear avilés spain 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña spain 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear these curtailments are expected to be completed in the first half of 2012 the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions are the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 

sales— sales for 2011 were 24951 compared with sales of 21013 in 2010 an improvement of 3938 or 19 the increase was primarily due to a rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum better pricing in the midstream segment and higher volumes in the primary metals segment and virtually all businesses in the midstream and downstream segments 

sales for 2010 were 21013 compared with sales of 18439 in 2009 an improvement of 2574 or 14 the increase was mainly driven by a rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum as a result of significantly higher lme prices favorable pricing in the midstream segment and sales from the smelters in norway acquired on march 31 2009 increase of 332 slightly offset by the absence of sales from divested businesses transportation products europe and most of global foil decrease of 175 and unfavorable mix in the downstream segment 

cost of goods sold— cogs as a percentage of sales was 821 in 2011 compared with 817 in 2010 the percentage was negatively impacted by higher energy and raw materials costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar mostly offset by the previously mentioned higher realized prices and net productivity improvements 

  

cogs as a percentage of sales was 817 in 2010 compared with 917 in 2009 the percentage was positively impacted by the significant rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum net cost savings and productivity improvements across all segments and the absence of a charge related to a european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 somewhat offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar unfavorable lifo adjustments as a result of the considerable rise in lme prices and a significantly smaller reduction in lifo inventory quantities increases in energy costs and higher operating costs for brazil growth projects placed in service 

selling general administrative and other expenses— sga expenses were 1027 or 41 of sales in 2011 compared with 961 or 46 of sales in 2010 the increase of 66 was principally the result of higher labor costs and an increase in bad debt expense the increase in labor costs was the result of a higher average employee base and a higher cost of employee benefits the higher bad debt expense was caused by charges for anticipated customer credit losses primarily related to those in europe 

sga expenses were 961 or 46 of sales in 2010 compared with 1009 or 55 of sales in 2009 the decline of 48 was mostly due to reductions in expenses for contractors and consultants lower deferred compensation as a result of a decline in plan performance and decreases in bad debt expense and information technology expenditures an increase in labor costs principally due to higher annual incentive and performance compensation and employee benefits costs employer matching savings plan contributions for us salaried participants were suspended during 2009 somewhat offset the aforementioned expense reductions 

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 184 in 2011 compared with 174 in 2010 and 169 in 2009 the increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 and in 2010 as compared to 2009 was mainly driven by incremental increases across varying expenses necessary to support rd activities 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1479 in 2011 compared with 1450 in 2010 the increase of 29 or 2 was mostly due to a portion of the assets placed into service in mid2011 related to a new hydroelectric power facility in brazil along with a number of small increases at various locations 

the provision for dda was 1450 in 2010 compared with 1311 in 2009 the increase of 139 or 11 was principally the result of the assets placed into service during the second half of 2009 related to the juruti bauxite mine development and são luís refinery expansion in brazil the smelters in norway acquired on march 31 2009 the new bohai china flatrolled product facility and a highquality coated sheet line at the samara russia facility slightly offset by the cessation in dda due to the decision in early 2010 to permanently shut down and demolish two us smelters see restructuring and other charges below 

restructuring and other charges— restructuring and other charges for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2011 were comprised of the following 

 

 layoff costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 

  

2011 actions— in 2011 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 281 181 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 127 82 aftertax in asset impairments and 36 23 aftertax in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at two us locations see below 93 68 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 1600 employees 820 in the primary metals segment 470 in the flatrolled products segment 160 in the alumina segment 20 in the engineered products and solutions segment and 130 in corporate including the effects of planned smelter curtailments see below 23 12 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for other asset impairments including the writeoff of the carrying value of an idled structure in australia that processed spent pot lining and adjustments to the fair value of the one remaining foil location while it was classified as held for sale due to foreign currency movements 20 8 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for a litigation matter related to the former st croix location a net charge of 5 4 aftertax for other small items and 23 16 aftertax for the reversal of previously recorded layoff reserves due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances including a change in plans for alcoa’s aluminum powder facility in rockdale tx 

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two us locations each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons the identified facilities are the smelter located in alcoa tn capacity of 215 kmtperyear and two potlines capacity of 76 kmtperyear at the smelter located in rockdale tx remaining capacity of 191 kmtperyear composed of four potlines demolition and remediation activities related to these actions will begin in the first half of 2012 and are expected to be completed in 2015 for the tennessee smelter and in 2013 for the two potlines at the rockdale smelter this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs the asset impairments of 127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties plants and equipment related to these facilities additionally remaining inventories mostly operating supplies were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 6 4 aftertax which was recorded in cogs the other exit costs of 36 represent 18 11 aftertax in environmental remediation and 17 11 aftertax in asset retirement obligations both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 1 1 aftertax in other related costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme italy 150 kmtperyear avilés spain 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña spain 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear these curtailments are expected to be completed in the first half of 2012 the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions are the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 as a result of these decisions alcoa recorded costs of 33 31 aftertax for the layoff of approximately 650 employees as alcoa engages in discussions with the respective employee representatives and governments additional charges may be recognized in 2012 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 380 of the 1600 employees were terminated the remaining terminations for the 2011 restructuring programs are expected to be completed by the end of 2012 in 2011 cash payments of 24 were made against layoff reserves related to the 2011 restructuring programs 

2010 actions— in 2010 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 207 130 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 127 80 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in asset impairments and 46 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in other exit costs related to the permanent shutdown and planned demolition of certain idled structures at five us locations see below 43 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 875 employees 625 in the engineered products and solutions segment 75 in the primary metals segment 60 in the alumina segment 25 in the flatrolled products segment and 90 in corporate 22 14 aftertax in net charges including 12 8 aftertax for asset impairments related to divested and to be divested businesses automotive castings global foil transportation products europe and packaging and consumer for among other items the settlement of a contract with a former customer foreign

in early 2010 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of the following structures each of which was previously temporarily idled for different reasons the eastalco smelter located in frederick md capacity of 195 kmtperyear the smelter located in badin nc capacity of 60 kmtperyear an aluminum fluoride plant in point comfort tx a paste plant and cast house in massena ny and one potline at the smelter in warrick in capacity of 40 kmtperyear this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals cost competitiveness other existing idle capacity required future capital investment and restart costs as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs the asset impairments of 127 represent the write off of the remaining book value of properties plants and equipment related to these facilities additionally remaining inventories mostly operating supplies were written down to their net realizable value resulting in a charge of 8 5 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which was recorded in cogs the other exit costs of 46 represent 30 19 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in asset retirement obligations and 14 9 aftertax in environmental remediation both triggered by the decision to permanently shut down and demolish these structures and 2 1 aftertax and noncontrolling interests in other related costs 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 790 of the 875 employees were terminated the remaining terminations are expected to be completed by the end of 2012 in 2011 and 2010 cash payments of 7 and 21 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to 2010 restructuring programs 

2009 actions— in 2009 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 237 151 aftertax and noncontrolling interests which were comprised of the following components 177 121 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for the layoff of approximately 6600 employees 2980 in the engineered products and solutions segment 2190 in the flatrolled products segment 1080 in the primary metals segment 180 in the alumina segment and 170 in corporate to address the impact of the global economic downturn on alcoa’s businesses and a 9 6 aftertax curtailment charge due to the remeasurement of pension plans as a result of the workforce reductions 41 20 aftertax in adjustments to the global foil and transportation products europe businesses held for sale due to unfavorable foreign currency movements for both businesses and a change in the estimated fair value for the global foil business and 13 11 aftertax in other asset impairments 18 12 aftertax for the writeoff of previously capitalized thirdparty costs related to potential business acquisitions due to the adoption of changes to accounting for business combinations net charges of 19 10 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for various other items such as accelerated depreciation and lease termination costs for shutdown facilities and 40 29 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances 

as of december 31 2011 approximately 5700 of the 6000 employees were terminated the total number of employees associated with 2009 restructuring programs was updated in 2010 to reflect changes in plans eg the previously mentioned new power agreement at the portovesme smelter in italy – see 2010 actions above natural attrition and other factors the remaining terminations are expected to be completed by the end of 2012 in 2011 and 2010 cash payments of 13 and 60 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to 2009 restructuring programs 

  

alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense— interest expense was 524 in 2011 compared with 494 in 2010 the increase of 30 or 6 was primarily due to a 41 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes 74 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a 33 gain for “inthemoney” interest rate swaps somewhat offset by the absence of a 14 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes 42 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a 28 gain for “inthemoney” interest rate swaps 

interest expense was 494 in 2010 compared with 470 in 2009 the increase of 24 or 5 was principally caused by a 69 decline in interest capitalized mainly the result of placing the juruti and são luís growth projects in service during the second half of 2009 and a 14 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes 42 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a 28 gain for “inthemoney” interest rate swaps mostly offset by a 7 lower average debt level primarily due to the absence of commercial paper resulting from alcoa’s improved liquidity position and lower amortization expense of financing costs principally related to the fees paid fully amortized in october 2009 for the former 1900 364day senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

other income expenses net— other income net was 87 in 2011 compared with other expenses net of 5 in 2010 the change of 92 was mainly the result of a net favorable change of 89 in marktomarket derivative contracts a gain of 43 from the sale of land in australia and higher equity income from an investment in a natural gas pipeline in australia due to the recognition of a discrete income tax benefit by the consortium alcoa world alumina and chemicals’ share of the benefit was 24 slightly offset by a decrease in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance 

other expenses net was 5 in 2010 compared with other income net of 161 in 2009 the change of 166 was mostly due to the absence of a 188 gain on the elkemsapa ab exchange transaction a 92 gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and a 22 gain on the sale of property in vancouver wa net foreign currency losses and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance partially offset by the absence of both a 182 realized loss on the sale of an equity investment and an equity loss related to alcoa’s former 50 equity stake in elkem and a net favorable change of 25 in marktomarket derivative contracts 

income taxes— alcoa’s effective tax rate was 240 provision on income in 2011 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate mainly due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 269 provision on income in 2010 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions a 57 discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available a 24 discrete income tax benefit related to a canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in us dollars and a 13 net discrete income tax benefit for various other items partially offset by a 79 discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax 

  

treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and a 19 discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities this amount represents a decrease to alcoa’s unrecognized tax benefits 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 383 benefit on a loss in 2009 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to a 12 income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests’ share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the following discrete tax items a 71 benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment a 34 benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets a 31 benefit for a tax rate change from 15 to 18 in iceland a 31 benefit related to a canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in us dollars a 10 benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the global foil business than originally anticipated and a 7 benefit related to the elkemsapa ab exchange transaction partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in italy which included a 41 valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows 250 related to a recent decision by the european commission on electricity pricing 15 for environmental remediation and 15 for layoffs 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2012 will be approximately 27 however changes in the current economic environment tax legislation or rate changes currency fluctuations ability to realize deferred tax assets and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 

in december 2011 one of the company’s subsidiaries in brazil applied for a tax holiday related to its expanded mining and refining operations if approved the tax rate for this subsidiary will decrease significantly resulting in future cash tax savings over the 10year holiday period would be effective as of january 1 2012 additionally the net deferred tax asset of the subsidiary would be remeasured at the lower rate in the period the holiday is approved this remeasurement would result in a decrease to the net deferred tax asset and a noncash charge to earnings of approximately 60 to 90 

noncontrolling interests— net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 194 in 2011 compared with 138 in 2010 the increase of 56 was largely the result of higher earnings at alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac which is owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited the improved earnings at awac were mainly driven by higher realized prices partially offset by higher input costs and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 138 in 2010 compared with 61 in 2009 the increase of 77 was mostly due to higher earnings at awac which is owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited the improved earnings at awac were attributed primarily to a rise in realized prices partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar higher depreciation expense and operating costs related to the juruti and são luís growth projects placed into service in the second half of 2009 and the absence of a gain recognized on the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname 

loss from discontinued operations— loss from discontinued operations in 2011 was 3 comprised of an additional loss of 3 5 pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the electrical and electronic solutions ees business as a result of a negotiated preliminary settlement related to claims filed in 2010 against alcoa by platinum equity in an insolvency proceeding in germany a net gain of 2 3 pretax related to both the wire harness and electrical portion and the electronics portion of the ees business for a number of small postclosing and other adjustments and a 2 2 pretax reversal of the gain recognized in 2006 related to the sale of the home exteriors business for an adjustment to an outstanding obligation which was part of the terms of sale 

loss from discontinued operations in 2010 was 8 comprised of an additional loss of 6 9 pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of 2 4 pretax related to the electronics portion of the ees business for the settling of working capital which was not included in the divestiture transaction 

  

loss from discontinued operations in 2009 was 166 comprised of a 129 168 pretax loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business a 9 13 pretax loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business and the remainder was for the operational results of the ees business prior to the divestitures 

in late 2008 alcoa reclassified the ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to divest the business the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business was completed in june 2009 and the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business was completed in december 2009 the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the ees business into discontinued operations 

segment information 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals flatrolled products and engineered products and solutions segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges discontinued operations and other items including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 1893 in 2011 1424 in 2010 and 234 in 2009 see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information the following discussion provides shipments sales and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2011 

alumina 

 

 this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide refinery system including the mining of bauxite which is then refined into alumina alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products a portion of this segment’s thirdparty sales are completed through the use of agents alumina traders and distributors slightly more than half of alcoa’s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally by the primary metals segment 

in 2011 alumina production increased by 564 kmt compared to 2010 the improvement was mostly the result of higher production at the são luís brazil refinery as the rampup of the 2100 kmt expanded capacity the alumina segment’s share is approximately 1100 kmtperyear that began in late 2009 continued through 2011 

  

in 2010 alumina production increased by 1657 kmt compared to 2009 the increase was mainly driven by the point comfort tx refinery as most of the 1500 kmtperyear curtailment initiated between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 was restored in addition production included the continued rampup of the são luís refinery expansion and the 45 interest in the suralco suriname refinery acquired in mid2009 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment improved 23 in 2011 compared with 2010 largely attributable to a 21 increase in realized prices driven by the movement of customer contracts to alumina index pricing benefits from improved spot prices and improved pricing from lmebased contracts thirdparty sales for this segment rose 30 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily related to a 29 increase in realized prices driven by significantly higher lme prices coupled with a 7 increase in volumes 

intersegment sales for the alumina segment climbed 23 in 2011 compared with 2010 and 44 in 2010 compared with 2009 the increase in both period comparisons was principally due to higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the primary metals segment 

atoi for the alumina segment increased 306 in 2011 compared with 2010 mainly caused by the significant improvement in realized prices and a gain on the sale of land in australia 30 partially offset by considerably higher input costs particularly related to caustic and fuel oil and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar especially against the australian dollar 

atoi for this segment improved 189 in 2010 compared with 2009 mostly due to the significant increase in realized prices and benefits of cost savings initiatives particularly lower caustic costs these positive impacts were partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar particularly against the australian dollar higher depreciation expense and operating costs includes the impact of a failure of a ship unloader associated with the startup of the juruti bauxite mine and the são luís refinery expansion both of which began in the second half of 2009 the absence of a 60 gain recognized on the acquisition of bhp billiton’s interest in suralco and higher fuel oil costs 

in 2012 thirdparty sales will continue to shift towards alumina index or spot pricing and productivity improvements will be an intense area of focus also significant planned maintenance for operations in australia during the first part of the year and higher costs for raw materials are expected to negatively impact results additionally alumina production across the global system will be reduced to reflect smelter curtailments as well as prevailing market conditions furthermore in the second half of 2012 alcoa’s refineries in australia will be subject to a carbon tax recently approved by the australian government related to greenhouse gas emissions this is not expected to have a significant impact on the alumina segment’s results in 2012 

primary metals 

 

 this segment represents a portion of alcoa’s upstream operations and consists of the company’s worldwide smelter system primary metals receives alumina mostly from the alumina segment and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa’s fabricating businesses as well as sold to external customers aluminum traders and commodity markets results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess power are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buyresell activity primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents more 

  

than 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales buyresell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 

at december 31 2011 alcoa had 644 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4518 kmt in 2011 idle capacity decreased 234 kmt compared to 2010 due to the full restart of previously curtailed production capacity in the us massena east ny 125 kmtperyear wenatchee wa 43 kmtperyear and ferndale wa intalco 47 kmtperyear 11 kmt more than previously planned these restarts increased aluminum production by approximately 150 kmt during 2011 and are expected to increase aluminum production by 215 kmt on an annual basis in 2012 and beyond and occurred to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 

in late 2011 management approved the permanent shutdown and demolition of certain facilities at two us locations each of which was previously temporarily idled for various reasons the identified facilities are the smelter located in alcoa tn capacity of 215 kmtperyear and two potlines capacity of 76 kmtperyear at the smelter located in rockdale tx remaining capacity of 191 kmtperyear composed of four potlines this decision was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision were in general focused on achieving sustained competitiveness and included among others lack of an economically viable longterm power solution changed market fundamentals cost competitiveness required future capital investment and restart costs 

also at the end of 2011 management approved a partial or full curtailment of three european smelters as follows portovesme italy 150 kmtperyear avilés spain 46 kmt out of 93 kmtperyear and la coruña spain 44 kmt out of 87 kmtperyear these curtailments are expected to be completed in the first half of 2012 the curtailment of the portovesme smelter may lead to the permanent closure of the facility while the curtailments at the two smelters in spain are planned to be temporary these actions are the result of uncompetitive energy positions combined with rising material costs and falling aluminum prices mid2011 to late 2011 

as a result of these decisions idle capacity is expected to decrease by a net 51 kmt and base capacity will decline by 291 kmt during 2012 

at december 31 2010 alcoa had 878 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4518 kmt in 2010 idle capacity decreased 356 kmt compared to 2009 due to the restart of 32 kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at a smelter in brazil the decision to permanently curtail the smelters located in frederick md 195 kmtperyear and badin nc 60 kmtperyear and one potline 40 kmtperyear at the smelter in warrick in and the restart of 61 kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at various smelters slightly offset by the full curtailment of the fusina smelter 44 kmtperyear in italy as a result of uneconomical power prices in june 2010 alcoa halted production at the avilés smelter 93 kmtperyear in spain due to torrential flooding production was restarted a few months after the flood and the smelter was at full operating rate by the end of 2010 base capacity dropped 295 kmt between december 31 2010 and 2009 due to the previously mentioned permanent curtailments the decision to permanently curtail these facilities was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals cost competitiveness other existing idle capacity required future capital investment and restart costs as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs 

in 2011 aluminum production improved by 189 kmt mainly the result of the previously mentioned restarted capacity at massena east ferndale and wenatchee as well as higher production at the avilés smelter see above in 2010 aluminum production increased by 22 kmt mostly due to the two smelters located in norway acquired full ownership on march 31 2009 previously held a 50 equity interest as well as a number of small increases at other smelters but was virtually offset by the smelter curtailments during 2009 for tennessee and massena east and during 2010 for fusina and the halted production at the avilés smelter 

  

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment improved 17 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to a 12 rise in average realized prices driven by 10 higher average lme prices higher volumes largely attributable to the previously mentioned restarted us capacity and increased revenue from the sale of excess power thirdparty sales for this segment climbed 35 in 2010 compared with 2009 mainly due to a 27 rise in average realized prices driven by 31 higher average lme prices and the acquisition of the smelters located in norway increase of 332 slightly offset by a decline in both buyresell activity and volumes 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment rose 23 in 2011 compared with 2010 and 41 in 2010 compared with 2009 the increase in both period comparisons was mainly the result of an improvement in realized prices driven by the higher lme and an increase in buyresell activity 

atoi for the primary metals segment declined 7 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily caused by significantly higher input costs including carbon alumina and energy and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar virtually offset by improved realized prices net productivity improvements and higher excess power sales 

atoi for this segment improved 1100 in 2010 compared with 2009 principally related to the significant increase in realized prices the absence of a charge related to a european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 and benefits from cost savings initiatives particularly coke and pitch somewhat offset by much higher alumina and energy prices the absence of a gain related to alcoa’s acquisition of the other 50 of the smelters in norway 112 and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 

in 2012 pricing is anticipated to follow a 15day lag on the lme and net productivity improvements are expected to continue also planned maintenance for power plants during the first part of the year and higher energy costs are expected to negatively impact results while a benefit is anticipated in the second half of the year related to coke prices as a result of a shift in the supplydemand balance from short to long additionally three smelters in europe representing 240 kmtperyear are expected to be fully or partially curtailed during the first half of the year furthermore in the second half of 2012 alcoa’s smelters in australia will be subject to a carbon tax recently approved by the australian government related to greenhouse gas emissions this is not expected to have a significant impact on the primary metals segment’s results in 2012 

flatrolled products 

 

 this segment represents alcoa’s midstream operations whose principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate and sheet a small portion of this segment’s operations relate to foil produced at one plant in brazil this segment includes rigid container sheet rcs which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans seasonal increases in rcs sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year this segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace automotive commercial transportation and building and construction markets mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables which is sold directly to customers and through distributors approximately onehalf of the thirdparty sales in this segment consist of rcs while the other onehalf of thirdparty sales are derived from sheet and plate and foil used in industrial markets while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of rcs sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers 

thirdparty sales for the flatrolled products segment climbed 22 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily driven by better pricing higher volumes across most businesses particularly related to the packaging aerospace and commercial transportation markets favorable foreign currency movements mainly due to a stronger euro and favorable product 

  

mix thirdparty sales for this segment increased 3 in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to better pricing and higher volumes in most key end markets partially offset by lower volumes in the segment’s can sheet business largely due to a decision in early 2010 to curtail sales to a north american customer and the absence of sales 125 in 2009 from two foil plants spain and china which were divested in late 2009 

atoi for the flatrolled products segment rose 46 in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily attributable to the previously mentioned positive pricing volume and product mix impacts partially offset by higher input costs and charges for anticipated customer credit losses atoi for this segment improved 269 in 2010 compared with 2009 mainly the result of both favorable pricing and increased productivity across all businesses due to cost savings initiatives including the operations in russia as results turned profitable 

in 2012 continued demand strength in the aerospace and automotive markets is expected although the outlook for europe remains weak additionally net productivity improvements are anticipated somewhat offset by higher energy and transportation costs

liquidity and capital resources 

alcoa maintains a disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet in 2011 as in the prior two years management continued this approach while providing the company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively as the global economy continues to recover from the economic downturn that began in 2008 

in response to changes in the economic markets across the globe in the second half of 2008 management initiated the following actions to conserve cash and preserve liquidity greater scrutiny over the daily management of alcoa’s cash position higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels targeted headcount reductions across the globe a global salary and hiring freeze lifted at the beginning of 2010 suspension of the existing share repurchase program expired in december 2010 and the addition of a new 364day 1900 revolving credit facility expired in october 2009 a number of changes were also made to alcoa’s capital expenditures strategy as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible and all noncritical capital expenditures were stopped capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa’s compliance with the law keep a facility operating or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs the planned sale or shutdown of various businesses contributed positively to alcoa’s liquidity position in 2009 

in march 2009 management initiated an additional series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve alcoa’s cost structure and liquidity operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from 017 per share to 003 per share which began with the dividend paid on may 25 2009 and the issuance of 1725 million shares of common stock and 575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded 1438 in net proceeds 

in january 2010 management initiated further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in 2009 but to improve on them throughout 2010 also a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa’s alumina and aluminum products 

in 2011 management continued its previous actions to maintain the achieved procurement and overhead savings from the past two years and to further improve cash with working capital initiatives additionally maintaining a level of capital expenditures consistent with that of 2010 was planned during 2012 management plans to continue the actions from the past three years to achieve additional procurement and overhead savings to further improve on working capital and to maintain a consistent level of capital expenditures 

along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa’s current operational and business needs for an analysis of longterm liquidity see contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

cash from operations 

cash from operations in 2011 was 2193 compared with 2261 in 2010 the decline of 68 or 3 was largely attributable to higher pension contributions of 223 a lower net cash inflow associated with working capital of 206 an additional cash outflow of 71 in noncurrent assets and a lower cash inflow of 36 in noncurrent liabilities mostly offset by better operating results 

  

the higher pension contributions were principally driven by cash contributions made to us pension plans towards maintaining an approximately 80 funded status 

the major components of the lower net cash inflow in working capital were as follows an additional outflow of 122 in inventories mostly due to higher production as a result of increased demand and rising input costs a higher inflow of 47 in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily driven by the absence of collateral posted related to a marktomarket energy contract that ended in september 2011 an additional inflow of 66 in accounts payable trade principally the result of higher purchasing needs and timing of vendor payments a lower outflow of 201 in accrued expenses mostly related to fewer cash payments for restructuring programs and the absence of a reduction in collateral held related to marktomarket energy contracts and a smaller inflow of 385 in taxes including income taxes mainly due to the absence of a 347 federal income tax refund for the carryback of alcoa’s 2009 net loss to prior tax years 

the additional outflow in noncurrent assets was largely attributable to higher deferred mining costs related to bauxite operations in australia while the lower inflow in noncurrent liabilities was mainly caused by a smaller increase in the environmental remediation reserve 

cash from operations in 2010 was 2261 compared with 1365 in 2009 the improvement of 896 or 66 was primarily due to significantly better operating results partially offset by a lower net cash inflow associated with working capital of 904 

the major components of the lower net cash inflow in working capital were as follows an additional outflow of 787 in receivables primarily as a result of higher sales in three of the four reportable segments and a significant rise in lme prices a higher outflow of 1485 in inventories mostly due to a buildup of levels to meet anticipated demand and higher input costs an additional inflow of 962 in accounts payable trade principally the result of higher purchasing needs and timing of vendor payments and a higher inflow of 646 in taxes including income taxes mainly due to a 310 receivable recorded in 2009 and the receipt of 347 in 2010 both related to a federal income tax refund for the carryback of alcoa’s 2009 net loss to prior tax years

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities environmental and litigation matters asset retirement obligations the testing of goodwill equity investments and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses to be divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

  

derivatives and hedging derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program for derivatives designated as fair value hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur future gains or losses on the derivative instrument are recorded in other income or expense 

alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing longterm debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges as a result the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense consistent with the underlying hedged item 

alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales cost of goods sold or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures generally not exceeding five years 

if no hedging relationship is designated the derivative is marked to market through earnings 

cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine 

  

reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record an aro for the removal treatment transportation storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks polychlorinated biphenyls various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2011 ranges from less than 1 to 52 per structure 131 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include deterioration in general economic conditions negative developments in equity and credit markets adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods among others the fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has nine reporting units of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment the primary metals segment the flatrolled products segment and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil which is included in corporate almost 90 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs 1153 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1627 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment and primary metals 1841 these amounts include an allocation of corporate’s goodwill 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance for testing goodwill for impairment see the recently adopted accounting guidance section of note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the guidance provides an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not more than 50 that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not the entity is then required to perform the existing twostep quantitative impairment test described below otherwise no further analysis is required an entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and instead proceed directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test the ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test 

in the 2011 fourth quarter in conjunction with management’s annual review of goodwill alcoa early adopted the new guidance as a result alcoa instituted a policy for its annual review of goodwill to perform the qualitative assessment for all reporting units not subjected directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test management will proceed 

  

directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for a minimum of three reporting units based on facts and circumstances during each annual review of goodwill this policy will result in each of the nine reporting units being subjected to the twostep quantitative impairment test at least once during every threeyear period 

under the qualitative assessment various events and circumstances or factors that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified similar to impairment indicators above these factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive neutral and adverse categories based on current business conditions additionally an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high medium and low weighting furthermore management considers the results of the most recent twostep quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit this would be 2010 in which the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and compares the weighted average cost of capital wacc between the current and prior years for each reporting unit 

during the 2011 annual review of goodwill management performed the qualitative assessment for six reporting units management concluded that it was not more likely than not that the estimated fair values of the six reporting units were less than their carrying values as such no further analysis was required 

under the twostep quantitative impairment test the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

during the 2011 annual review of goodwill management proceeded directly to the twostep quantitative impairment test for three reporting units as follows the primary metals segment building and construction systems which is included in the engineered products and solutions segment and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil the estimated fair values of these three reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values resulting in no impairment 

as part of the 2011 annual review of goodwill management considered the market capitalization of alcoa’s common stock in relation to the company’s total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2011 the market capitalization of alcoa’s common stock was 9207 while this amount is less than the company’s total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2011 the estimated aggregate fair value of alcoa’s reporting units was substantially in excess of the aforementioned market capitalization amount in management’s judgment the main reasons for the difference between alcoa’s market capitalization and total shareholders’ equity at december 31 2011 are the overall decline in the capital markets and significantly lower commodity prices as it relates to the capital markets there was and continues to be significant uncertainty of the sovereign debt of many european countries this uncertainty has affected the liquidity of many companies that either operate or are located in europe although alcoa has not been impacted significantly the combination of this uncertainty and the continuing decline in commodity prices caused significant and volatile fluctuations in the price of alcoa’s common stock at december 31 2011 and 2010 the market price of alcoa’s common stock was 865 and 1539 respectively which equates to a decline of 44 during 2011 the size and 

  

structure of the company did not change and there were no specific events or transactions that would cause management to reasonably expect such a decline in the market price of alcoa’s common stock as a result management believes the quoted market price of alcoa’s common stock does not fully reflect the underlying value of the future aggregate cash flows of the company’s reporting units accordingly management does not believe that the comparison of alcoa’s market capitalization and total shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2011 is an indication that goodwill is impaired 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortia which are accounted for on the equity method the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair value that is ultimately realized upon the divestiture of a business may differ from the estimated fair value reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases health care cost trend rates retirement age and mortality 

the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking manufacturing transportation insurance and pharmaceutical among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times in 2011 2010 and 2009 the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for us pension and other postretirement benefit plans was 490 575 and 615 respectively the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 425 and either a charge or credit of 18 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fouryear average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forwardlooking returns by asset class as described below 

prior to developing the expected longterm rate of return for calendar year 2009 management focused on historical actual returns annual 10year moving and 20year moving averages when developing this assumption based on that process management utilized 9 for the expected longterm rate of return for several years through 2008 for calendar year 2009 the expected longterm rate of return was reduced to 875 due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn this was supported by the fact that in 2008 the 10year moving average of actual performance fell below 9 for the first time in 20 years although the 20year moving average continued to exceed 9 

for calendar year 2010 management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management’s own judgment management considered this forwardlooking analysis as well as the historical return information and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar 2010 would remain at 875 which was between the 20year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class 

for calendar year 2011 management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis based on strategic asset allocation changes and estimates of future returns by asset class management used 850 as its expected longterm rate of return for 2011 this rate again falls within the range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class 

for calendar year 2012 management used the same methodology as it did for 2011 and determined that 850 will be the expected longterm rate of return 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 16 for 2012 

in 2011 a net charge of 991 593 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to an 85 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was slightly offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs in 2010 a net charge of 216 138 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive income primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs in 2009 a net charge of 182 102 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive income primarily due to a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs additionally in 2010 and 2009 a charge of 2 and 8 respectively was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility annual forfeiture rate and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant equity grants are issued in january each year as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation 

  

expense recorded in 2011 2010 and 2009 was 83 56 aftertax 84 57 aftertax and 87 58 aftertax respectively of this amount 18 19 and 21 in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

most plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 

valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all available positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and the company’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance 

tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

bauxite interests 

aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide commonly referred to as alumina aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina the company obtains bauxite from its own resources and from those belonging to the awac enterprise located in the countries listed in the chart below as well as pursuant to both longterm and shortterm contracts and mining leases in 2010 alcoa consumed 383 million metric tons mt of bauxite from awac and its own resources 68 million mt from related third parties and 17 million mt from unrelated third parties alcoa’s present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future the following table provides information regarding the company’s bauxite interests

 kingdom of saudi arabia joint venture 

in december 2009 alcoa and saudi arabian mining company ma’aden entered into an agreement setting forth the terms of a joint venture between them to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex in the kingdom of saudi arabia in its initial phases the joint venture plans to develop a fully integrated industrial complex that will include a bauxite mine with an initial capacity of 4 million mtpy an alumina refinery with an initial capacity of 18 million mtpy an aluminum smelter with an initial capacity of ingot slab and billet of 740000 mtpy and a rolling mill with initial capacity of 380000 mtpy the mill is expected to focus initially on the production of sheet end and tab stock for the manufacture of aluminum cans and potentially other products to serve the construction automotive and other industries 

the refinery smelter and rolling mill will be established within the new industrial zone of ras az zawr on the east coast of the kingdom of saudi arabia first production from the aluminum smelter and rolling mill is anticipated in 2013 and first production from the mine and refinery is expected in 2014 

total capital investment is expected to be approximately 108 billion sar 405 billion ma’aden owns a 749 interest in the joint venture alcoa owns a 251 interest in the smelter and rolling mill with the awac group having a 251 interest in the mine and refinery for additional information regarding the joint venture see the equity investments section of note i to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

alumina refining facilities and capacity 

alcoa is the world’s leading producer of alumina alcoa’s alumina refining facilities and its worldwide alumina capacity are shown in the following table

as noted above alcoa and ma’aden entered into an agreement that involves the development of an alumina refinery in the kingdom of saudi arabia initial capacity of the refinery is expected to be 18 million mtpy first production is expected in 2014 

the 21 million mtpy expansion of the alumar consortium alumina refinery in são luís maranhão has increased the refinery’s nameplate capacity to approximately 35 million mtpy with alcoa’s share of such capacity more than doubling to 189 million mtpy based on its 54 ownership stake through alumínio and awac construction on the refinery was finalized at the end of 2009 

in november 2005 alcoa world alumina llc awa llc and rio tinto alcan inc signed a basic agreement with the government of guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 15 million mtpy alumina refinery in guinea in 2006 the basic agreement was approved by the guinean national assembly and was promulgated into law the basic agreement was originally set to expire in november 2008 but has been extended to november 2012 prefeasibility studies were completed in 2008 further project activities are contemplated in 2011 

in september 2006 alcoa received environmental approval from the government of western australia for expansion of the wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 47 million mtpy a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy this approval has a term of 5 years and included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before alcoa can seek construction approval for the project the project was suspended in november 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure longterm energy supply in western australia these constraints continue and as such the project remains under suspension alcoa is therefore seeking an extension of the 2006 environmental approval for the expansion for a further 5 years 

in 2008 awac signed a cooperation agreement with vietnam national coalminerals industries group vinacomin in which they agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study of the gia nghia bauxite mine and alumina refinery project located in dak nong province in vietnam’s central highlands with first stage capacity expected to be between 10 and 15 million mtpy the cooperation between awac and vinacomin on gia nghia is subject to approval by the government of vietnam if established the gia nghia venture is expected to be 51 owned by vinacomin 40 by awac and 9 by others

 item 1a risk factors 

alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed separately in this report the following are some factors that could cause alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

the aluminum industry generally remains highly cyclical and is influenced by a number of factors including global economic conditions 

the aluminum industry generally remains highly cyclical alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in lme prices economic conditions generally and aluminum enduse markets the global economic downturn that occurred in 2008 and 2009 coupled with the global financial and credit market disruptions had a historic negative impact on the aluminum industry and alcoa these events contributed to an unprecedented decline in lmebased aluminum prices weak end markets a sharp drop in demand increased global inventories and higher costs of borrowing andor diminished credit availability while the economy has recovered from the crisis of the economic downturn and alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum remain bright the company is unable to predict the future course of industry variables or the strength pace or sustainability of the economic recovery and the effects of government intervention the company implemented a number of operational and financial actions in 2009 and 2010 to improve its cost structure and liquidity including curtailing production halting noncritical capital expenditures accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials divesting noncore assets reducing global headcount suspending its share repurchase program reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and making other liquidity enhancements however there is no assurance that these actions or any others that the company has taken or may take will be sufficient to counter any future economic or industry disruptions in addition there is no assurance that the measures taken by alcoa or any benefits of these measures will be sustainable in a changing or improving business environment another global economic downturn prolonged recovery period or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business or financial condition or results of operations 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices 

the price of aluminum is frequently volatile and changes in response to general economic conditions expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories the influence of hedge funds and other financial investment funds participating in commodity markets has also increased in recent years contributing to higher levels of price volatility at the same time there is often a lag effect for a reduction in lmelinked costs of production for example reduction of certain key smelting input costs such as alumina and power may lag declining average primary metal revenue by up to 90 days continued high lme inventories could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum industry overcapacity including decisions by alcoa or its competitors to reactivate idle facilities or build new capacity could contribute to a weak pricing environment a sustained weak aluminum pricing environment or a deterioration in aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

  

a reduction in demand or a lack of increased demand for aluminum by china or a combined number of other countries may negatively impact alcoa’s results 

the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for commodities including aluminum a sustained slowdown in china’s economic and aluminum demand growth that is not offset by increased aluminum demand growth in other emerging economies such as india brazil and several south east asian countries or the combined slowdown in other markets could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices in addition china’s investments to increase its selfsufficiency in key commodities may impact future demand and supply balances and prices 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts the following factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects for decreases in commodity or lmelinked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transportation of raw materials to refining and smelting locations alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results will be affected by significant lag effects for declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in lmelinked costs of alumina and power during a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the brazilian real canadian dollar euro and australian dollar may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies whereas products are generally sold in us dollars 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from its growth projects or portfolio streamlining strategy 

as a result of the global economic downturn and as part of the company’s initiative to conserve cash and preserve liquidity alcoa halted all noncritical capital investment in 2009 except for the nowcompleted são luís refinery expansion and the greenfield juruti bauxite mine and the ongoing estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil and 

  

the china and russia growth projects management believes that these projects will be beneficial to alcoa however there is no assurance that these benefits will be realized whether due to unfavorable global economic conditions currency fluctuations or other factors or that the remaining construction startup activities and testing on the estreito project will be completed as planned by the targeted completion date 

alcoa has made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to streamline its portfolio there can be no assurance that such actions will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned or beneficial to alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met in addition acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions successfully alcoa may face barriers to exit from unprofitable businesses including high exit costs or objections from various stakeholders 

alcoa may not be able to successfully realize goals established in each of its four business segments or by the dates targeted for such goals 

alcoa has announced targets for each of its four major business segments including the following 

 

  

  

  

 there can be no assurance that all of these initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that alcoa will be able to successfully realize these goals at the targeted levels or by the projected dates 

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into other similar arrangements in the future for example in december 2009 alcoa announced that it formed a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop a fully integrated aluminum complex including a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill in the kingdom of saudi arabia although the company has in relation to that joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances necessarily involve special risks whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the joint venture with ma’aden is subject to risks associated with large infrastructure construction projects including the risk of potential adverse changes in the financial markets that could affect the ability of the joint venture to fully implement its financing plans or to achieve financial close for the phases of the project and the consequences of 

  

noncompliance with the timeline and other requirements under the gas supply arrangements for the joint venture also while financing is in place for the smelter and rolling mill which are viable as standalone operations without the bauxite mine and alumina refinery there can be no guaranteed assurance that the latter two portions of the project will be fully funded or that the project as a whole will be completed within budget or by the targeted completion date or that it or alcoa’s other joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions lack of financing increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

alcoa faces significant competition 

as discussed in part i item 1 business – competitive conditions of this report the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

further metals industry consolidation could impact alcoa’s business 

the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted alcoa’s business further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict 

failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings could limit alcoa’s ability to obtain future financing increase its borrowing costs adversely affect the market price of its existing securities or otherwise impair its business financial condition and results of operations 

currently alcoa’s longterm debt is rated bbb with negative outlook by standard and poor’s ratings services baa3 with negative outlook by moody’s investors services and bbb with negative outlook by fitch ratings there can be no assurance that any rating assigned will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in that rating agency’s judgment circumstances so warrant maintaining an investmentgrade credit rating is an important element of alcoa’s financial strategy a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings could adversely affect the market price of its securities adversely affect existing financing limit access to the capital or credit markets or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms if at all result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that the company incurs increase the cost of borrowing or impair its business financial condition and results of operations in addition under the project financing for the joint venture project in saudi arabia a downgrade of alcoa’s credit ratings below investment grade by at least two rating agencies would require alcoa to provide a letter of credit or fund an escrow account for a portion or all of alcoa’s remaining equity commitment to the joint venture for additional information regarding the project financing see note i to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this report 

alcoa could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under committed credit facilities 

as discussed in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources of this report alcoa has a committed revolving credit facility with financial institutions available for its use for which the company pays commitment fees the facility is provided by a syndicate of several financial institutions with each institution agreeing severally and not jointly to make revolving credit loans to alcoa in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement if one or more of the financial institutions 

  

providing the committed credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment the portion of the committed facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to the company 

alcoa may not be able to realize expected benefits from the change to index pricing of alumina 

alcoa has announced its intention to move to a pricing mechanism for alumina based on an index of alumina prices rather than a percentage of the lmebased aluminum price alcoa believes that this change expected to affect approximately 20 of annual contracts coming up for renewal each year will more fairly reflect the fundamentals of alumina including raw materials and other input costs involved there can be no assurance that such index pricing will be accepted or that such index pricing will result in consistently greater profitability from sales of alumina 

alcoa’s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries outside the us having varying degrees of political and economic risk including china guinea russia and saudi arabia among others risks include those associated with political instability civil unrest expropriation nationalization renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements mining leases and permits commercial instability caused by corruption and changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition or operating results 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa the company may experience a change in effective tax rates or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws antibribery laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

  

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws and regulations 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known at previously owned sites sites previously operated by us sites owned by our predecessors or sites that we may acquire in the future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to several sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

climate change climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that consumption of energy derived from fossil fuels is a contributor to global warming 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers or alcoa’s supply chain inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly from changes in costs of goods sold 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

adverse changes in discount rates lowerthanexpected investment return on pension assets and other factors could affect alcoa’s results of operations or level of pension funding contributions in future periods 

alcoa’s results of operations may be negatively affected by the amount of expense alcoa records for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require that alcoa calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations these valuations reflect assumptions about financial market and other economic conditions which may change based on changes in key economic indicators the most significant yearend assumptions used by alcoa to estimate pension or other postretirement benefit income or expense for the following year are the discount rate the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality in addition alcoa is required to make an annual measurement of plan assets and liabilities which may result in a significant charge to shareholders’ equity for a discussion regarding how alcoa’s financial statements can be affected by pension and other 

  

postretirement benefits accounting policies see part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption “critical accounting policies and estimates—pension and other postretirement benefits” and part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data under note w to the consolidated financial statements—pension and other postretirement benefits although gaap expense and pension funding contributions are not directly related the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or securities alcoa would contribute to the pension plans potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law and discretionary contributions to improve the plans’ funded status 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

a significant portion of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates while alcoa was successful in renegotiating the master collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers in june 2010 alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate other collective bargaining agreements in the us and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

alcoa’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

alcoa’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled executives and staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company and industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoa’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

alcoa may not realize expected longterm benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies and deployment of companywide business process models such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there is no assurance that these initiatives will all be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode and carbothermic technology in addition to multialloy casting processes there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

alcoa’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by reductions in its capital expenditures 

in response to the global economic downturn and related disruptions in the financial markets alcoa changed its capital expenditures strategy in 2009 as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible and all noncritical capital expenditures were stopped capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa’s compliance with the law keep a facility operating or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs alcoa expects to increase its sustaining capital expenditures in 2011 compared with 2009 and 2010 levels to meet nonrecurring needs including remediation and rebuilding of certain properties and assets despite this increase in 2011 capital review processes and limiting overall capital spend will continue in 2011 and beyond 

  

alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in greenfield and brownfield projects and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities if demand for aluminum improves alcoa’s ability to take advantage of that improvement may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions and the longterm value of its business could be adversely impacted the company’s position in relation to its competitors may also deteriorate 

alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditures in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates if alcoa’s interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions its growth could be constrained any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance further existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

the above list of important factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance

alcoa leases some of its facilities however it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or the properties’ values 

alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations although no title examination of properties owned by alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties see notes a and h to the financial statements for information on properties plants and equipment

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites the most significant of these matters including the remediation of the grasse river in massena ny are discussed in the environmental matters section of note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on pages 112115 

as previously reported representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources trustees have asserted that alcoa and reynolds metals company reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa’s and reynolds’ operations at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal proceedings have not been instituted the company has continued to actively investigate these claims pursuant to an agreement entered into with the trustees in 1991 alcoa and reynolds had been working cooperatively with general motors corporation which is facing similar claims by the trustees to assess potential injuries to natural resources in the region with the bankruptcy of general motors in 2009 motors liquidation company mlc took over general motors’ liability in this matter in september 2009 mlc notified alcoa and the trustees that it would no longer participate in the cooperative process alcoa and the trustees agreed to continue to work together cooperatively without mlc to resolve alcoa’s and reynolds’ natural resources damages liability in this matter in january 2011 the trustees representing the united states the state of new york and the mohawk tribe and alcoa reached an agreement in principle to resolve the natural resource damage claims the agreement is subject to final approval of the respective parties and will be subject to a federal court approved consent decree including public notice and comment final entry of a settlement consent decree is not expected until the 2011 second quarter or later any upward adjustment in the remediation reserve would be taken upon the finalization of the settlement agreement which at this time is not anticipated to be material 

as previously reported in september 1998 hurricane georges struck the us virgin islands including the st croix alumina llc sca facility on the island of st croix the wind and rain associated with the hurricane caused material at the location to be blown into neighboring residential areas various cleanup and remediation efforts were undertaken by or on behalf of sca a notice of violation was issued by the division of environmental protection dep of the department of planning and natural resources dpnr of the virgin islands government and has been contested by alcoa a civil suit was commenced in the territorial court of the virgin islands by certain residents of st croix in february 1999 seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged personal injuries 

  

and property damages associated with “bauxite or red dust” from the sca facility the suit which has been removed to the district court of the virgin islands the “court” names sca alcoa and glencore ltd as defendants and in august 2000 was accorded class action treatment the class is defined to include persons in various defined neighborhoods who “suffered damages andor injuries as a result of exposure during and after hurricane georges to red dust and red mud blown during hurricane georges” all of the defendants have denied liability and discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been underway since 1999 plaintiffs’ expert reports claim that the material blown during hurricane georges consisted of bauxite and red mud and contained crystalline silica chromium and other substances the reports further claim among other things that the population of the six subject neighborhoods as of the 2000 census a total of 3730 people has been exposed to toxic substances through the fault of the defendants and hence will be able to show entitlement to lifetime medical monitoring as well as other compensatory and punitive relief these opinions have been contested by the defendants’ expert reports that state among other things that plaintiffs were not exposed to the substances alleged and that in any event the level of alleged exposure does not justify lifetime medical monitoring alcoa and sca moved to decertify the plaintiff class and the assigned district judge adopted a recommendation that class certification be maintained for liability issues only and that the class be decertified after liability issues have been resolved alcoa and sca have turned over this matter to their insurance carriers who are providing a defense glencore ltd is jointly defending the case with alcoa and sca and has a pending motion to dismiss in june 2008 the court granted defendants’ joint motion to decertify the class of plaintiffs and simultaneously granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs’ motion for certification of a new class under the new certification order there is no class as to the personal injury property damage or punitive damages claims the named plaintiffs had previously dropped their claims for medical monitoring during the course of the briefing of the certification motions the court did certify a new class as to the claim of ongoing nuisance insofar as plaintiffs seek cleanup abatement or removal of the red mud currently present at the facility the court expressly denied certification of a class as to any claims for remediation or clean up of any area outside the facility including plaintiffs’ property the new class could seek only injunctive relief rather than monetary damages named plaintiffs however could continue to prosecute their claims for personal injury property damage and punitive damages in august 2009 in response to defendants’ motions the court dismissed the named plaintiffs’ claims for personal injury and punitive damages and denied the motion with respect to their property damage claims in september 2009 the court granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the class plaintiffs’ claim for injunctive relief as of october 29 2009 plaintiffs appealed the court’s summary judgment order dismissing the claim for injunctive relief and alcoa and sca filed a motion to dismiss that appeal at the us court of appeals for the third circuit a decision by the third circuit is pending the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss

as previously reported in july 2006 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy to some energyintensive industries complies with european union eu state aid rules the italian power tariff extended the tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 alcoa has been incurring higher power costs at its smelters in italy subsequent to the tariff end date the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 prior to expiration of the tariff in 2005 alcoa had been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government the ec’s announcement expressed concerns about whether italy’s extension of the tariff beyond 2005 was compatible with eu legislation and potentially distorted competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs 

on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and therefore the italian government is to recover a portion of the benefit 

  

alcoa received since january 2006 including interest the amount of this recovery will be based on a calculation that is being prepared by the italian government pending formal notification from the italian government alcoa estimates that a payment in the range of 300 to 500 million will be required during 2011 in late 2009 after discussions with legal counsel and reviewing the bases on which the ec decided including the different considerations cited in the ec decision regarding alcoa’s two smelters in italy alcoa recorded a charge of 250 million including 20 million to writeoff a receivable from the italian government for amounts due under the now expired tariff structure on april 19 2010 alcoa filed an appeal of this decision with the general court of the eu alcoa will pursue all substantive and procedural legal steps available to annul the ec’s decision on may 22 2010 alcoa also filed with the general court a request for injunctive relief to suspend the effectiveness of the decision but on july 12 2010 the general court denied such request on september 10 2010 alcoa appealed the july 12 2010 decision to the european court of justice a judgment by that court is expected in early 2011 

separately on november 29 2006 alcoa filed an appeal before the general court formerly the european court of first instance seeking the annulment of the ec’s decision to open an investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules on march 25 2009 the general court denied alcoa’s appeal on may 29 2009 alcoa appealed the march 25 2009 ruling the hearing of the may 29 2009 appeal was held on june 24 2010 and a decision from the court of justice is expected in 2011 

as previously reported in november 2006 in curtis v alcoa inc civil action no 306cv448 ed tenn a class action was filed by plaintiffs representing approximately 13000 retired former employees of alcoa or reynolds and spouses and dependents of such retirees alleging violation of the employee retirement income security act erisa and the labormanagement relations act by requiring plaintiffs beginning january 1 2007 to pay health insurance premiums and increased copayments and coinsurance for certain medical procedures and prescription drugs plaintiffs allege these changes to their retiree health care plans violate their rights to vested health care benefits plaintiffs additionally allege that alcoa has breached its fiduciary duty to plaintiffs under erisa by misrepresenting to them that their health benefits would never change plaintiffs seek injunctive and declaratory relief back payment of benefits and attorneys’ fees alcoa has consented to treatment of plaintiffs’ claims as a class action during the fourth quarter of 2007 following briefing and argument the court ordered consolidation of the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction with trial certified a plaintiff class bifurcated and stayed the plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claims struck the plaintiffs’ jury demand but indicated it would use an advisory jury and set a trial date of september 17 2008 in august 2008 the court set a new trial date of march 24 2009 and subsequently the trial date was moved to september 22 2009 in june 2009 the court indicated that it would not use an advisory jury at trial trial in the matter was held over eight days commencing september 22 2009 and ending on october 1 2009 in federal court in knoxville tn before the honorable thomas phillips us district court judge at the conclusion of evidence the court set a posthearing briefing schedule for submission of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law by the parties and for replies to the same post trial briefing was submitted on december 4 2009 however no schedule was set for handing down a decision alcoa believes that it presented substantial evidence in support of its defenses at trial however at this stage of the proceeding the company is unable to reasonably predict the outcome alcoa estimates that in the event of an unfavorable outcome the maximum exposure would be an additional postretirement benefit liability of approximately 300 million 

as previously reported in january 2007 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules at the time the ec opened its investigation alcoa had been operating in spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies the investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the ec with respect to the energyintensive consumers the ec opened the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than a pool price mechanism therefore being in principle artificially below market conditions alcoa submitted comments in which the company provided evidence that prices paid by energyintensive consumers were in line with the market in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations 

  

and therefore no state aid is present in the tariff system while alcoa does not believe that an unfavorable decision is probable management has estimated that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision could be in the range of 50 to 100 million €40 to €70 million pretax also while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005 it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years a decision by the ec is expected in 2011 if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts

results of operations 

earnings summary 

income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2010 was 262 or 025 per diluted share compared with a loss from continuing operations of 985 or 106 per share in 2009 the improvement of 1247 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following continued increases in realized prices for alumina and aluminum ongoing net costs savings and productivity improvements across all segments and the absence of both a charge associated with a european commission electricity pricing matter in italy and a loss on the sale of an equity investment partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements higher energy costs unfavorable changes in lifo last in first out inventories additional depreciation charges and operating costs for growth projects and the absence of gains on the exchange of equity interests and on the acquisition of bauxite and refinery interests 

loss from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2009 was 985 or 106 per share compared with income from continuing operations of 229 or 027 per share in 2008 the decline of 1214 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum large volume decreases in the midstream and downstream operations a charge associated with a european commission electricity pricing matter in italy a loss on the sale of an equity investment charges related to 2009 restructuring programs and higher depreciation and interest charges all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses the absence of the charges associated with 2008 restructuring programs net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar favorable lifo inventory adjustments various discrete income tax benefits and a significant fluctuation in income taxes due to a change in the results of operations from pretax income to a pretax loss a gain on the exchange of equity interests a gain on the acquisition of an entity in the republic of suriname and net income of various other nonoperating items 

net income attributable to alcoa for 2010 was 254 or 024 per share compared with a net loss of 1151 or 123 per share in 2009 and a net loss of 74 or 010 per share in 2008 in 2010 the net income of 254 included a loss from discontinued operations of 8 and in 2009 and 2008 the net loss of 1151 and 74 included a loss from discontinued operations of 166 and 303 respectively 

in march 2009 alcoa announced a series of operational and financial actions which were in addition to those announced at the end of 2008 to significantly improve alcoa’s cost structure and liquidity operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from 017 per share to 003 per share which began with the dividend paid on may 25 2009 and the issuance of 1725 million shares of common stock and 575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded 1438 in net proceeds in january 2010 alcoa announced further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in 2009 but to improve on them throughout 2010 also a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa’s alumina and aluminum products 

in late 2008 management made the decision to reduce alcoa’s aluminum and alumina production in response to the then significant economic downturn as a result of this decision reductions of 750 kmt or 18 of annualized output from alcoa’s global smelting system were implemented includes previous curtailment at rockdale tx in june 2008 accordingly reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by 1500 kmtperyear across the global refining system the aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early 2009 as planned smelters in rockdale 267 kmtperyear and tennessee 215 kmtperyear were fully curtailed while another 268 kmtperyear was partially curtailed at various other locations the refinery in point comfort tx was partially curtailed by approximately 1500 kmtperyear between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 384 kmtperyear remains curtailed as of december 31 2010 in mid2009 further action became necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the massena east ny smelter 125 kmtperyear and partially curtail the suralco suriname refinery 480 kmtperyear – represented alcoa world alumina and chemicals’ awac previous 55 ownership interest at the time of curtailment – total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt 

  

in the first half of 2011 alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters located in the us massena east ny three potlines or 125 kmtperyear wenatchee wa one potline or 43 kmtperyear and ferndale wa intalco 36 kmtperyear these restarts are expected to increase alcoa’s aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter and are occurring to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 

in june 2008 alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production three of six operating potlines or 120 kmt at its rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale’s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues in september 2008 alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines or 147 kmt as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter wellknown issues regarding the cost and longterm reliability of the power supply and overall market conditions in 2008 the earnings impact of the idled potlines was 55 90 pretax alcoa sought damages and other relief from its power supplier through litigation in 2010 a trial was held and the verdict resulted in no award of monetary damages to alcoa although the company may submit certain disputed amounts up to 4 to accounting arbitration and may audit the books and record of its power supplier additionally in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines alcoa recorded restructuring charges in 2008 of 31 48 pretax mostly for the layoff of approximately 870 employees see restructuring and other charges below for additional information 

also in june 2008 a major gas supplier to alcoa’s western australia refining operations part of alcoa of australia suffered a pipeline rupture and fire which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier’s gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers the disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in alcoa of australia’s production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations as a result shortly thereafter alcoa of australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts during the second half of 2008 the supplier partially restored the gas supply to alcoa of australia full restoration occurred in the first half of 2009 in addition insurance recoveries of 52 were received in the second half of 2008 net of insurance benefits alcoa’s earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was 49 102 before tax and noncontrolling interest in 2008 the alumina segment was impacted by 33 47 before tax and the remaining impact of 29 55 before tax was reflected in corporate due to alcoa’s captive insurance program in 2009 additional insurance recoveries of 24 were received which benefited the results of alcoa by 10 24 before tax and noncontrolling interest and the alumina segment by 17 24 before tax alcoa of australia is part of awac which is 60 owned by alcoa and 40 owned by alumina limited 

sales— sales for 2010 were 21013 compared with sales of 18439 in 2009 an improvement of 2574 or 14 the increase was mainly driven by a continued rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum as a result of significantly higher london metal exchange lme prices favorable pricing in the midstream operations and sales from the smelters in norway acquired on march 31 2009 increase of 332 slightly offset by the absence of sales from divested businesses transportation products europe and most of global foil decrease of 175 and unfavorable mix in the downstream operations 

sales for 2009 were 18439 compared with sales of 26901 in 2008 a decline of 8462 or 31 the decrease was primarily due to a drop in realized prices for alumina and aluminum driven by significantly lower lme prices volume declines in the midstream and downstream operations due to continued weak end markets unfavorable foreign currency movements mostly the result of a weaker euro and australian dollar and the absence of sales from the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment 516 in 2008 all of which was slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in norway increase of 452 

cost of goods sold— cogs as a percentage of sales was 817 in 2010 compared with 917 in 2009 the percentage was positively impacted by the continued significant rise in realized prices for alumina and aluminum net cost savings and productivity improvements across all segments and the absence of a charge related to a european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 somewhat offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar unfavorable lifo adjustments as a result of the considerable rise in 

  

lme prices and a significantly smaller reduction in lifo inventory quantities increases in energy costs and higher operating costs for brazil growth projects placed in service 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 917 in 2009 compared with 824 in 2008 the percentage was negatively impacted by significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum lower demand in the midstream and downstream operations and a charge related to a european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 these items were somewhat offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and positive lifo adjustments in 2009 alcoa recognized 361 235 aftertax in income due to the reductions in lifo inventory quantities and the considerable drop in lme prices of this amount 71 occurred in the second half of the year 

selling general administrative and other expenses— sga expenses were 961 or 46 of sales in 2010 compared with 1009 or 55 of sales in 2009 the decline of 48 was mostly due to continued reductions in expenses for contractors and consultants lower deferred compensation as a result of a decline in plan performance and decreases in bad debt expense and information technology expenditures an increase in labor costs principally due to higher annual incentive and performance compensation and employee benefits costs employer matching savings plan contributions for us salaried participants were suspended during 2009 somewhat offset the aforementioned expense reductions 

sga expenses were 1009 or 55 of sales in 2009 compared with 1167 or 43 of sales in 2008 the decline of 158 was primarily due to reductions in labor costs mainly as a result of implemented severance programs decreases in expenses for travel contractors and consultants information technology selling and marketing and various other administrative items as part of alcoa’s cost reduction initiatives the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment 37 in 2008 and a decrease in bad debt expense all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation mostly the result of the plans’ improved performance and an increase due to sga of the acquired smelters in norway 

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 174 in 2010 compared with 169 in 2009 and 246 in 2008 the increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 was mainly driven by incremental increases across varying expenses necessary to support rd activities the decline in 2009 as compared to 2008 was principally due to the implementation of alcoa’s cost reduction initiatives and the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment 3 in 2008 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1450 in 2010 compared with 1311 in 2009 the increase of 139 or 11 was principally the result of the assets placed into service during the second half of 2009 related to the juruti bauxite mine development and são luís refinery expansion in brazil the smelters in norway acquired on march 31 2009 the new bohai china flatrolled product facility and a highquality coated sheet line at the samara russia facility slightly offset by the cessation in dda due to the decision to permanently shutdown and demolish two us smelters in early 2010 see restructuring and other charges below 

the provision for dda was 1311 in 2009 compared with 1234 in 2008 the increase of 77 or 6 was mostly due to the acquired smelters in norway and assets placed into service during 2009 including the juruti bauxite mine and são luis refinery in brazil the new bohai flatrolled product facility and a highquality coated sheet line at the samara facility these increases were slightly offset as a result of the cessation of dda which began in january 2009 related to the global foil and transportation products europe businesses due to the classification of these businesses as held for sale and a reduction in dda as a result of the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review which was completed in mid2008 of estimated useful lives 11 

  

restructuring and other charges— restructuring and other charges for each year in the threeyear period ended december 31 2010 were comprised of the following

as of december 31 2010 approximately 5500 of the 6000 employees were terminated the total number of employees associated with 2009 restructuring programs was updated to reflect changes in plans eg the previously mentioned new power agreement at the portovesme smelter in italy – see 2010 activity above natural attrition and other factors the remaining terminations are expected to be completed by the end of 2011 in 2010 and 2009 cash payments of 60 and 62 respectively were made against layoff reserves related to 2009 restructuring programs 

2008 actions– in late 2008 alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio partly due to the economic downturn such actions included targeted reductions curtailments and plant closures and consolidations which will reduce headcount by approximately 5300 resulting in layoff charges of 138 98 aftertax and noncontrolling interests asset impairments of 156 88 aftertax and noncontrolling interests and other exit costs of 58 57 aftertax the significant components of these actions were as follows 

– as a result of market conditions the primary metals segment reduced production by 483 thousand metric tons kmt and the alumina segment reduced production by a total of 1500 kmt fully implemented in early 2009 further reductions occurred later in 2009 these production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately 1110 positions totaling 23 in layoff costs asset impairments of 116 related to these two segments were also recognized including the write off of 84 in engineering costs related to a 1500 kmt planned expansion of jamalco’s clarendon jamaica refinery

 – in order to reduce overhead serving various businesses approximately 130 positions were eliminated at corporate resulting in severance charges of 14 and other exits costs of 3 

  

in addition to the above actions alcoa intends to sell its global foil the sabiñánigo spain and shanghai china plants were sold in late 2009 and transportation products europe sold in 2010 businesses in order to streamline its portfolio as a result of this decision the assets and related liabilities of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses were classified as held for sale asset impairments of 129 100 aftertax and 52 49 aftertax were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses respectively also alcoa and orkla asa agreed to exchange their stakes in the sapa ab and elkem aluminium ans joint ventures this portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of 333 223 aftertax to reflect the estimated fair value of alcoa’s investment in sapa ab 

earlier in 2008 alcoa recorded 48 31 aftertax in charges which consisted of 44 29 aftertax for the layoff of approximately 870 employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and 4 2 aftertax for other exit costs associated with the complete production curtailment of the rockdale tx smelter 267 kmt due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale’s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues also during 2008 alcoa recorded a loss of 43 32 aftertax on the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses the remaining net charges in 2008 were comprised of 1 1 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for layoff related to a reduction in headcount of approximately 30 4 for other exit costs 6 aftertax and 23 15 aftertax and noncontrolling interests for reversals of previously recorded costs slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility

alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the results of its reportable segments the pretax impact of allocating such charges to segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense— interest expense was 494 in 2010 compared with 470 in 2009 resulting in an increase of 24 or 5 the increase was principally caused by a 69 decline in interest capitalized mainly the result of placing the juruti and são luís growth projects in service during the second half of 2009 and a 14 net charge related to the early retirement of various outstanding notes 42 in purchase premiums paid partially offset by a 28 gain for “inthemoney” interest rate swaps mostly offset by a 7 lower average debt level primarily due to the absence of commercial paper resulting from alcoa’s improved liquidity position and lower amortization expense of financing costs principally related to the fees paid fully amortized in october 2009 for the former 1900 364day senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

interest expense was 470 in 2009 compared with 407 in 2008 resulting in an increase of 63 or 15 the increase was primarily due to a 10 higher average debt level mostly the result of 575 in convertible notes issued in march 2009 and increased borrowings on loans in brazil began in april 2008 related to the juruti são luís and estreito growth projects and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs mainly due to a 66 beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and 43 in fees paid for the 1900 364day senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in october 2008 and expired in october 2009 both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of alcoa’s debt portfolio 

other expenses income net— other expenses net was 5 in 2010 compared with other income net of 161 in 2009 the change of 166 was mostly due to the absence of a 188 gain on the elkemsapa ab exchange transaction a 92 gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and a 22 gain on the sale of property in vancouver wa net foreign currency losses and a smaller improvement in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance partially offset by the absence of both a 182 realized loss on the sale of the shining prospect investment and an equity loss related to alcoa’s former 50 equity stake in elkem and a net favorable change of 25 in marktomarket derivative contracts 

other income net was 161 in 2009 compared with 59 in 2008 the increase of 102 was mainly the result of a 188 gain on the elkemsapa ab exchange transaction net foreign currency gains due to a stronger us dollar net gains related to the improvement in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance a 92 gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and a 22 gain on the sale of property in vancouver wa these positive impacts were partially offset by a 182 realized loss on the sale of the shining prospect investment a decline in the value of marktomarket derivative contracts a decrease in equity income related to alcoa’s share of the results of elkem sapa ab and shining prospect prior to the exchange and sale of these investments the absence of a 2008 negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment 39 and an estimated loss on excess power at the ferndale wa smelter 30 

income taxes— alcoa’s effective tax rate was 269 provision on income in 2010 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions a 57 discrete income tax benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance as a result of previously restricted net operating losses of a foreign subsidiary now available a 24 discrete income tax benefit related to a canadian provincial tax law change permitting a tax return to be filed in us dollars and a 13 net discrete income tax benefit for various other items partially offset by a 79 discrete income tax charge as a result of a change in the tax treatment of federal subsidies received related to prescription drug benefits provided under certain retiree health care benefit plans that were determined to be actuarially equivalent to medicare part d and a 19 discrete income tax charge based on settlement discussions of several matters with international taxing authorities this amount represents a decrease to alcoa’s unrecognized tax benefits  

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 383 benefit on a loss in 2009 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to a 12 income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests’ share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the following discrete tax items a 71 benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment a 34 benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets a 31 benefit for a tax rate change from 15 to 18 in iceland a 31 benefit related to a canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in us dollars a 10 benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the global foil business than originally anticipated and a 7 benefit related to the elkemsapa ab exchange transaction partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in italy which included a 41 valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows 250 related to a recent decision by the european commission on electricity pricing 15 for environmental remediation and 15 for layoffs 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 432 provision on income in 2008 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the following income tax charges 73 for the asset impairments included in the 2008 restructuring program 28 due to a decrease in deferred 

  

tax assets of the iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change from 18 to 15 a net 19 associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations these charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a 20 discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the 2007 us income tax return 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2011 will be approximately 30 however changes in the current economic environment tax legislation currency fluctuations and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate 

noncontrolling interests— net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 138 in 2010 compared with 61 in 2009 the increase of 77 was mostly due to higher earnings at awac which is owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited the improved earnings at awac were attributed primarily to a continued rise in realized prices partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar higher depreciation expense and operating costs related to the juruti and são luís growth projects placed into service in the second half of 2009 and the absence of a gain recognized on the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 61 in 2009 compared with 221 in 2008 the decline of 160 was principally due to lower earnings at awac mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the absence of the impact of the 2008 gas outage in western australia 

loss from discontinued operations— loss from discontinued operations in 2010 was 8 comprised of an additional loss of 6 9 pretax related to the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business as a result of a contract settlement with a former customer of this business and an additional loss of 2 4 pretax related to the electronics portion of the ees business for the settling of working capital which was not included in the divestiture transaction 

loss from discontinued operations in 2009 was 166 comprised of a 129 168 pretax loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business a 9 13 pretax loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business and the remainder was for the operational results of the ees business prior to the divestitures 

loss from discontinued operations in 2008 was 303 comprised of asset impairments of 162 225 pretax to reflect the estimated fair value of the ees business and a net operating loss of 141 199 pretax which included restructuring charges of 39 53 pretax for headcount reductions of approximately 6200 and a charge of 16 25 pretax for obsolete inventory 

in late 2008 alcoa reclassified the ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to divest the business the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business was completed in june 2009 and the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business was completed in december 2009 the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the ees business into discontinued operations 

segment information 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals flatrolled products and engineered products and solutions the packaging and consumer segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 2008 segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the 

aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting 

  

interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges discontinued operations and other items including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income are excluded from segment atoi 

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 1424 in 2010 234 in 2009 and 2199 in 2008 see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k for additional information the following discussion provides shipments sales and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2010 

alumina 

 

 this segment known as upstream operations consists of alcoa’s worldwide alumina system including the mining of bauxite which is then refined into alumina alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers who process it into industrial chemical products a portion of this segment’s thirdparty sales are completed through the use of agents alumina traders and distributors slightly more than half of alcoa’s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally 

in 2010 alumina production increased by 1657 kmt compared to 2009 the increase was mainly driven by the point comfort tx refinery as most of the 1500 kmtperyear curtailment initiated between the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 has been restored in addition production included the continued rampup of the são luís brazil refinery expansion which began in late 2009 the alumina segment’s share is approximately 1100 kmtperyear and the 45 interest in the suralco suriname refinery acquired in mid2009 

in 2009 alumina production decreased by 991 kmt compared to 2008 the reduction was mostly the result of the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009 which included approximately 1500 kmtperyear at the point comfort refinery and approximately 480 kmtperyear at the suralco refinery represented awac’s previous 55 ownership interest at the time of curtailment – total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt partially offsetting the curtailments was increased production at the following refineries all set production records in 2009 jamalco jamaica pinjarra and wagerup australia and são luis where rampup of the 2100 kmt expansion began in late 2009 production also increased due to additional capacity of approximately 600 kmt from the acquisition total acquired was approximately 990 kmt – 390 was curtailed of bhp billiton’s 45 interest in suralco on july 31 2009 100 of the suralco refinery’s operations were reflected in this segment beginning august 1 2009 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment rose 30 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily related to a 29 increase in realized prices driven by significantly higher lme prices coupled with a 7 increase in volumes thirdparty sales for this segment declined 26 in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to a 35 drop in realized prices driven by significantly lower lme prices and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker australian dollar both of which were somewhat offset by an increase in volumes 

  

intersegment sales for the alumina segment climbed 44 in 2010 compared with 2009 mainly as a result of higher realized prices and an increase in demand from the primary metals segment intersegment sales for this segment dropped 45 in 2009 compared with 2008 mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a reduction in demand from the primary metals segment 

atoi for the alumina segment improved 189 in 2010 compared with 2009 mostly due to the significant increase in realized prices and continued benefits of cost savings initiatives particularly lower caustic costs these positive impacts were partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar particularly against the australian dollar higher depreciation expense and operating costs includes the impact of a failure of a ship unloader associated with the startup of the juruti bauxite mine and the são luís refinery expansion both of which began in the second half of 2009 the absence of a 60 gain recognized on the acquisition of bhp billiton’s interest in suralco and continued higher fuel oil costs 

atoi for this segment declined 85 in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the significant drop in realized prices a tax settlement related to an equity investment in brazil 30 and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of growth projects placed into service midtolate 2009 in brazil juruti bauxite mine and são luis refinery all of which was partially offset by net procurement and overhead cost savings across most regions net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar a 60 gain recognized on the acquisition of bhp billiton’s interest in suralco and a positive impact related to the 2008 gas outage in western australia absence of 69 in costs partially offset by 19 less in insurance recoveries 

in 2011 productivity improvements will continue to be a focus but higher maintenance costs due to scheduled outages in australia and brazil are expected also it is anticipated that the rampup of são luís will stabilize without additional significant nonrecurring operating costs 

primary metals 

 

 this segment known as upstream operations consists of alcoa’s worldwide smelter system primary metals receives alumina mostly from the alumina segment and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa’s fabricating businesses as well as sold to external customers aluminum traders and commodity markets results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess power are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts and buyresell activity primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales buyresell activity refers to when this segment purchases metal from external or internal sources and resells such metal to external customers or the midstream and downstream segments in order to maximize smelting system efficiency and to meet customer requirements 

at december 31 2010 alcoa had 878 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4518 kmt in 2010 idle capacity decreased 356 kmt compared to 2009 due to the restart of 32 kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at a smelter in brazil the decision to permanently curtail the smelters located in frederick md 195 kmtperyear and badin nc 60 kmtperyear and one potline 40 kmtperyear at the smelter in warrick in and the restart of 61 kmt of previously curtailed production capacity at various smelters slightly offset by the full curtailment of the fusina 

  

smelter 44 kmtperyear in italy as a result of uneconomical power prices in june 2010 alcoa halted production at the avilés smelter 93 kmtperyear in spain due to torrential flooding production was restarted a few months after the flood and the smelter was at full operating rate by the end of 2010 base capacity dropped 295 kmt between december 31 2010 and 2009 due to the previously mentioned permanent curtailments the decision to permanently curtail these facilities was made after a comprehensive strategic analysis was performed to determine the best course of action for each facility factors leading to this decision included current market fundamentals cost competitiveness other existing idle capacity required future capital investment and restart costs as well as the elimination of ongoing holding costs 

at december 31 2009 alcoa had 1234 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4813 kmt in 2009 idle capacity increased by 480 kmt compared to 2008 due to the completion of targeted curtailment reductions including the tennessee smelter 215 kmtperyear the massena east ny smelter 125 kmtperyear and 140 kmt at various other smelters in response to the significant decline in lme prices and aluminum demand both as a result of the then global economic downturn base capacity rose by 282 kmt at december 31 2009 as compared to december 31 2008 due to the march 31 2009 acquisition of two smelters in norway in which alcoa previously held a 50 equity interest 

in 2010 aluminum production increased by 22 kmt mostly due to the smelters located in norway as well as a number of small increases at other smelters but was virtually offset by the smelter curtailments in tennessee massena east and fusina and the halted production at the avilés smelter in 2009 aluminum production declined 443 kmt mainly the result of the effects of smelter curtailments that began mid2008 including the smelters in rockdale 267 kmtperyear tennessee and massena east all of which was partially offset by an increase in production at the iceland smelter 344 kmtperyear as this smelter was not at full capacity until april 2008 and the acquisition of the lista 94 kmtperyear and mosjøen 188 kmtperyear smelters in norway 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment climbed 35 in 2010 compared with 2009 mainly due to a 27 rise in average realized prices driven by 31 higher average lme prices and the acquisition of the smelters located in norway increase of 332 slightly offset by a decline in both buyresell activity and volumes thirdparty sales for this segment decreased 35 in 2009 compared with 2008 mostly the result of a 32 drop in realized prices driven by a 35 decline in lme prices slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in norway increase of 452 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment rose 41 in 2010 compared with 2009 mainly as a result of an increase in realized prices driven by the higher lme and an increase in buyresell activity intersegment sales for this segment declined 53 in 2009 compared with 2008 mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a decline in volume due to lower demand from the midstream and downstream operations 

atoi for the primary metals segment improved 1100 in 2010 compared with 2009 principally related to the significant increase in realized prices the absence of a charge related to a european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 and continued benefits from cost savings initiatives particularly coke and pitch somewhat offset by much higher alumina and energy prices the absence of a gain related to alcoa’s acquisition of the other 50 of the smelters in norway 112 and net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar 

atoi for this segment declined 1543 in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the significant drop in realized prices a charge related to a european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 a decline in intersegment sales volume the impact of curtailing operations and additional power costs related to smelters in italy as a result of the termination of the then existing power tariff structure under legislative authority of the italian parliament 15 all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all regions lower costs for alumina net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and a gain related to the acquisition of two smelters in norway 112 

in 2011 the following trends are expected to continue pricing will follow a 15day lag on the lme higher energy and raw material costs and productivity improvements also alcoa plans to restart certain idled potlines at three smelters located in the us massena east three potlines or 125 kmtperyear wenatchee wa one potline or 43 kmtperyear and ferndale wa intalco 36 kmtperyear these restarts are expected to increase alcoa’s aluminum production by 137 kmt during 2011 and by 204 kmt on an annual basis thereafter and are occurring to help meet anticipated growth in aluminum demand and to meet obligations outlined in power agreements with energy providers 

  

flatrolled products 

 

 this segment’s known as midstream operations principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate and sheet a small portion of this segment’s operations still relate to foil most of this business was exited during 2009 and 2010 through shutdown actions and divestitures produced from one plant in brazil this segment includes rigid container sheet rcs which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans seasonal increases in rcs sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year this segment also includes sheet and plate used in the aerospace commercial transportation building and construction and distribution markets mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables which is sold directly to customers and through distributors approximately onehalf of the thirdparty sales in this segment consist of rcs while the other onehalf of thirdparty sales are derived from sheet and plate and foil used in industrial markets while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of rcs sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers 

thirdparty sales for the flatrolled products segment increased 3 in 2010 compared with 2009 principally due to better pricing and higher volumes in most key end markets partially offset by lower volumes in the segment’s can sheet business largely due to a decision in early 2010 to curtail sales to a north american customer and the absence of sales 125 in 2009 from two foil plants spain and china which were divested in late 2009 thirdparty sales for this segment declined 32 in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to a drop in prices attributable to unfavorable changes in the variable components of certain customer contracts and a reduction in volumes across most businesses both of which were mostly the result of weak end markets in europe and north america and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro and australian dollar 

atoi for the flatrolled products segment improved 269 in 2010 compared with 2009 mainly the result of both favorable pricing and increased productivity across all businesses due to cost savings initiatives including the operations in russia as results turned profitable atoi for this segment fell 46 in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily as a result of reduced volumes across most businesses the previously mentioned drop in prices and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the new coating line commissioned in samara russia and the new flatrolled product facility in bohai china all of which were mostly offset by procurement and overhead cost savings and net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar 

in 2011 the following trends are expected to continue strengthening demand in most regions around the globe higher energy costs and productivity improvements also improvements in product mix are anticipated as a result of the optimization of this segment’s portfolio 

engineered products and solutions 

 

 this segment known as downstream operations includes titanium aluminum and super alloy investment castings forgings and fasteners aluminum wheels integrated aluminum structural systems and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace automotive building and construction commercial transportation and power generation markets these products are sold directly to customers and through distributors additionally hard alloy extrusions products which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors serve the distribution aerospace automotive and commercial transportation markets in 2008 the electrical and electronic solutions business was classified as discontinued operations therefore all periods presented exclude the results of this business this business was sold during 2009 

  

in july 2010 alcoa completed an acquisition of the commercial building and construction business of a privatelyheld company traco for 77 this business located in cranberry pennsylvania employing 650 people is a premier manufacturer of windows and doors for the commercial building and construction market and generated sales of approximately 100 in 2009 the assets and liabilities of this business were included in the engineered products and solutions segment as of the end of july 2010 and this business’ results of operations were included in this segment since the beginning of august 2010 

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment decreased 2 in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to unfavorable pricing and mix across all businesses lower volumes for the fasteners power and propulsion and building and construction businesses the absence of sales related to the divestiture of the transportation products europe business in april 2010 decrease of 50 and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro these negative impacts were mostly offset by higher volumes in the wheels and forgings businesses and sales from the newly acquired business mentioned above 37 thirdparty sales for this segment declined 24 in 2009 compared with 2008 mostly due to lower volumes aluminum and nonaluminum across all businesses because of weak end markets lower pricing in the building and construction sector and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro 

atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment climbed 32 in 2010 compared with 2009 mainly due to productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives across all businesses partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix atoi for this segment fell 41 in 2009 compared with 2008 principally the result of lower volumes across all businesses and lower pricing partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings realized in all businesses 

in 2011 improvements in key end markets such as aerospace and commercial transportation are anticipated while productivity improvements are expected to continue 

packaging and consumer 

 

 the businesses within this segment were sold to rank group limited in 2008 therefore this segment no longer contains any operations prior to the sale of these businesses this segment included consumer foodservice and flexible packaging products food and beverage closures and plastic sheet and film for the packaging industry the principal products in this segment included aluminum foil plastic wraps and bags plastic beverage and food closures flexible packaging products thermoformed plastic containers and extruded plastic sheet and film consumer products were marketed under brands including reynolds wrap ®  diamond ®  baco ®  and cutrite ®  seasonal increases generally occurred in the second and fourth quarters of the year for such products as consumer foil and plastic wraps and bags while seasonal slowdowns for closures generally occurred in the fourth quarter of the year products were generally sold directly to customers consisting of supermarkets beverage companies food processors retail chains and commercial foodservice distributors 

reconciliation of atoi to consolidated net income loss attributable to alcoa 

items required to reconcile total segment atoi to consolidated net income loss attributable to alcoa include the impact of lifo inventory accounting interest expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges discontinued operations and other items including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency transaction gainslosses and interest income

liquidity and capital resources 

alcoa takes a very disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet in 2010 management continued to face the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively as the global economy continues to recover from the economic downturn that began in 2008 

in response to changes in the economic markets across the globe in the second half of 2008 management initiated the following actions to conserve cash and preserve liquidity greater scrutiny over the daily management of alcoa’s cash position higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels targeted headcount reductions across the globe a global salary and hiring freeze lifted at the beginning of 2010 suspension of the existing share repurchase program expired in december 2010 and the addition of a new 364day 1900 revolving credit facility expired in october 2009 a number of changes were also made to alcoa’s capital expenditures strategy as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible and all noncritical capital expenditures were stopped capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa’s compliance with the law keep a facility operating or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs the planned sale or shutdown of various businesses contributed positively to alcoa’s liquidity position in 2009 

in march 2009 alcoa announced an additional series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve the company’s cost structure and liquidity operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from 017 per share to 003 per share which began with the dividend paid on may 25 2009 and the issuance of 1725 million shares of common stock and 575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded 1438 in net proceeds 

in january 2010 alcoa announced further operational actions to not only maintain the procurement and overhead savings and working capital improvements achieved in 2009 but to improve on them throughout 2010 also a further reduction in capital expenditures was planned in order to achieve the level necessary to sustain operations without sacrificing the quality of alcoa’s alumina and aluminum products 

along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa’s current operational and business needs for a discussion of longterm liquidity see contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

cash from operations 

cash from operations in 2010 was 2261 compared with 1365 in 2009 resulting in an increase of 896 or 66 the improvement of 896 was primarily due to significantly better operating results partially offset by a 870 cash outflow associated with working capital the major components of the change in working capital were as follows a 770 increase in receivables primarily as a result of higher sales in three of the four reportable segments and a significant rise in lme prices a 1473 increase in inventories mostly due to a buildup of levels to meet anticipated demand and higher input costs a 960 increase in accounts payable trade principally the result of higher purchasing needs and timing of vendor payments and a 649 increase in taxes including income taxes mainly due to a 310 receivable recorded in 2009 and the receipt of 347 in 2010 both related to a federal income tax refund for the carryback of alcoa’s 2009 net loss to prior tax years 

  

cash from operations in 2009 was 1365 compared with 1234 in 2008 resulting in an increase of 131 or 11 the improvement of 131 was principally related to a 1639 cash inflow associated with working capital 395 in lower pension contributions and a positive change of 103 in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities all of which was mostly offset by significantly lower earnings including the effects of noncash income and expenses and 147 in cash used for discontinued operations the components of the change in working capital were as follows a 443 decrease in receivables primarily as a result of lower sales across all businesses and heightened collection efforts a 1611 reduction in inventories mostly due to lower levels of inventory onhand in response to a significant drop in demand curtailed production at alcoa’s refineries and smelters and reduced costs for certain raw materials a 223 decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets a 653 decrease in accounts payable trade principally the result of fewer purchasing needs and declining commodity prices a 187 increase in accrued expenses mainly driven by a charge related to a european commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters and a decline of 172 in taxes including income taxes mostly due to the change from an operating income position to an operating loss position 

financing activities 

cash used for financing activities was 952 in 2010 compared with cash provided from financing activities of 37 in 2009 and 1478 in 2008 

the use of cash in 2010 was primarily due to 1757 in payments on longterm debt mostly related to 511 for the repayment of 7375 notes due 2010 as scheduled 825 for the early retirement of all of the 650 notes due 2011 and a portion of the 600 notes due 2012 and 5375 notes due 2013 and 287 related to previous borrowings on the loans supporting the são luís refinery expansion and juruti bauxite mine development in brazil 125 in dividends paid to shareholders net cash paid to noncontrolling interests of 94 all of which relates to alumina limited’s share of awac 66 in acquisitions of noncontrolling interests mainly the result of the 60 paid to redeem the convertible securities of a subsidiary that were held by alcoa’s former partner related to the joint venture in saudi arabia and a change of 44 in shortterm borrowings partially offset by 1126 in additions to longterm debt 998 for the issuance of 6150 notes due 2020 and 76 related to borrowings under the loans that support the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil 

the source of cash in 2009 was principally the result of 1049 in additions to longterm debt mainly driven by net proceeds of 562 from the issuance of 575 in convertible notes and 394 in borrowings under loans that support the são luís refinery expansion juruti bauxite mine development and estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil net proceeds of 876 from the issuance of 1725 million shares of common stock and net cash received from noncontrolling interests of 340 principally related to alumina limited’s share of awac all of which was mostly offset by a 1535 decrease in outstanding commercial paper partly due to tightening in the credit markets and a reduction in market availability as a result of the change in alcoa’s credit ratings in early 2009 228 in dividends paid to shareholders a 292 net change in shortterm borrowings 1300 was borrowed and repaid under alcoa’s 1900 364day senior unsecured revolving credit facility in early 2009 and 255 in new loans to support alcoa alumínio’s export operations was borrowed and repaid during 2009 mostly the result of repayments of working capital loans in spain and asia and a 155 decrease in accounts payable settlement arrangements and payments on longterm debt of 156 including 97 related to the loans in brazil for growth projects 

the source of cash in 2008 was primarily due to 2253 in additions to longterm debt mainly driven by net proceeds of 1489 from the july 2008 public debt offering and 721 in borrowings under the loans in brazil for growth projects a 679 increase in outstanding commercial paper to support operations and capital spending net cash received from noncontrolling interests of 348 principally related to alumina limited’s share of awac and 177 in proceeds from employees exercising their stock options all of which was partially offset by 1082 for the repurchase of common stock 556 in dividends paid to shareholders payments on longterm debt of 204 mainly due to a repayment of 150 for 6625 notes due march 2008 and a 96 net change in shortterm borrowings mostly the result of a 78 decrease in accounts payable settlement arrangements

there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2010 and 2009 also no amounts were borrowed under the credit facility during 2010 and 2009 

on october 14 2008 alcoa entered into a revolving credit agreement rca3 with a syndicate of lenders rca3 provided a 1150 senior unsecured revolving credit facility rcf3 which matured on october 12 2009 in october and november 2008 alcoa increased the capacity of rcf3 by 500 and 250 respectively as provided for under rca3 alcoa paid a total of 43 in financing costs which were deferred and amortized to interest expense over the term of the facility for the initial capacity under rcf3 and for the 750 in increased capacity in early 2009 alcoa borrowed 1300 under rcf3 to support its operations during the then global economic downturn the 1300 was repaid on march 24 2009 with the net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes and common stock 

in march 2008 alcoa filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for an indeterminate amount of securities for future issuance this shelf registration statement replaced alcoa’s existing shelf registration statement as of december 31 2010 and 2009 3075 and 2075 respectively in senior debt securities were issued under the current shelf registration statement 

alcoa’s cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to alcoa’s debt by the major credit rating agencies 

  

on may 7 2010 standard and poor’s ratings services sp affirmed the following ratings for alcoa longterm debt at bbb and shortterm debt at a3 sp did not change the current outlook from negative

 obligations for operating activities 

energyrelated purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 40 years the majority of raw material and other purchase obligations have expiration dates of 24 months or less certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components and as a result actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table operating leases represent multiyear obligations for certain computer equipment plant equipment vehicles and buildings 

interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december 31 2010 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2037 the effect of outstanding interest rate swaps which are accounted for as fair value hedges are included in interest related to total debt as of december 31 2010 these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on 1065 of debt through 2018 as the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 

estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates the minimum required contributions for pension funding are estimated to be 445 for 2011 and 530 for 2012 the funding estimate is 500 for 2013 410 for 2014 and 330 for 2015 the expected pension contributions in 2011 and later reflect the impacts of the pension protection act of 2006 and the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 pension contributions are expected to continue to decline if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future in january 2011 alcoa contributed 36518563 newly issued shares of its common stock valued at 600 to a master trust that holds the assets of certain us defined benefit

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities environmental and litigation matters asset retirement obligations the testing of goodwill equity investments and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses to be divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

  

derivatives and hedging derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program for derivatives designated as fair value hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur future gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in other income or expense 

alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing longterm debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges as a result the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense consistent with the underlying hedged item 

alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income and are reclassified to sales cost of goods sold or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures generally not exceeding five years 

if no hedging relationship is designated the derivative is marked to market through earnings 

cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis or sooner if significant changes in matters have occurred to determine if a change in the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a loss is necessary 

  

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal treatment transportation storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks polychlorinated biphenyls various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2010 ranges from less than 1 to 52 per structure 129 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has nine reporting units of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment the primary metals segment the flatrolled products segment and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil which is included in corporate almost 90 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs 1009 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1623 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment and primary metals 1851 these amounts include an allocation of corporate goodwill in 2010 the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values resulting in no impairment 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s 

  

goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortiums which are accounted for on the equity method the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows and the estimated useful lives of assets also require significant judgments 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a companyspecific yield curve model abovemedian developed with the assistance of an external actuary the cash flows of the plans’ projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors including finance and banking manufacturing transportation insurance and pharmaceutical among others the yield curve model parallels the plans’ projected cash flows which have an average duration of 10 years and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the company’s plans’ obligations multiple times the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 would be approximately 355 and either a charge or credit of 12 to aftertax earnings in the following year 

  

the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a fiveyear marketrelated value of plan assets a fouryear average or the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain nonus plans the process used by management to develop this assumption has expanded from one that relied primarily on historical asset return information to one that also incorporates forwardlooking returns by asset class as described below 

prior to developing the expected longterm rate of return for calendar year 2009 management focused on historical actual returns annual 10year moving and 20year moving averages when developing this assumption based on that process management utilized 9 for the expected longterm rate of return for several years through 2008 for calendar year 2009 the expected longterm rate of return was reduced to 875 due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the then global economic downturn this was supported by the fact that in 2008 the 10year moving average of actual performance fell below 9 for the first time in 20 years although the 20year moving average continued to exceed 9 

for calendar year 2010 management expanded its process by incorporating expected future returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and management’s own judgment management considered this forwardlooking analysis as well as the historical return information and concluded the expected rate of return for calendar 2010 would remain at 875 which was between the 20year moving average actual return performance and the estimated future return developed by asset class 

for calendar year 2011 management again incorporated both actual historical return information and expected future returns into its analysis based on strategic asset allocations and current estimates of future returns by asset class management will be using 850 as its expected longterm rate of return for 2011 this rate again falls within the range of the 20year moving average of actual performance and the expected future return developed by asset class 

a change in the assumption for the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 16 for 2011 

in 2010 a net charge of 216 138 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive income primarily due to a 40 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs in 2009 a net charge of 182 102 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs additionally in 2010 and 2009 a charge of 2 and 8 respectively was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility annual forfeiture rate and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant equity grants are issued in january each year as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first half of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2010 2009 and 2008 was 84 57 aftertax 87 58 aftertax and 94 63 aftertax respectively of this amount 19 21 and 19 in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

  

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance management considers all potential sources of taxable income including income available in carryback periods future reversals of taxable temporary differences projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies as well as all positive and negative evidence positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations projections of future profitability within the carryforward period including from tax planning strategies and the company’s experience with similar operations existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses projections of future losses or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

energy 

alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power electric power accounts for approximately 24 of the company’s primary aluminum costs alcoa generates approximately 22 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements power generated by natural gas or in the alternative by fuel oil as purchased by the company accounts for approximately 15 and 14 respectively of the company’s total refining production costs the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters and refineries 

north america – electricity 

the deschambault baie comeau and bécancour smelters in québec purchase electricity under existing contracts that run through 2015 which will be followed on by longterm contracts with hydroquébec executed in december 2008 that expire in 2040 provided that alcoa completes the modernization of the baie comeau smelter by the end of 2015 the smelter located in baie comeau québec purchases approximately 65 of its power needs under the hydroquébec contract and receives the remainder from a 40owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power limited partnership whose ownership was restructured in 2009 with hydroquébec acquiring the 60 stake previously held by abitibi 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 28 of the power requirements for alcoa’s smelters in the us the company generally purchases the remainder under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates two hydroelectric projects tapoco and yadkin consisting of eight dams under federal energy regulatory commission ferc licenses apgi hydroelectric facilities provide electric power as needed for the aluminum smelters at alcoa tennessee and badin north carolina the tennessee smelter may also purchase power from the tennessee valley authority tva under a contract that extends to june 20 2010 discussions for the supply of power by tva to the smelter after the expiration of the current contract are underway 

apgi received a renewed 40year ferc license for the tapoco project in 2005 the relicensing process is nearing completion for the yadkin hydroelectric project license in 2007 apgi filed with ferc a relicensing settlement agreement with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues the national environmental policy act process is complete with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in april 2008 the remaining requirement for the relicensing was the issuance by north carolina of the required water quality certification under section 401 of the clean water act the section 401 water quality certification was issued on may 7 2009 but is being appealed and has been stayed since late may 2009 pending substantive determination on the appeal apgi received a yeartoyear license renewal from ferc in may 2008 and will continue to operate under annual licenses until the new section 401 certification is issued and the ferc relicensing process is complete with the badin smelter idled power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing llc and then sold into the wholesale market 

the company through apgi generates substantially all of the power used at its warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves since may 2005 alcoa has owned the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves which mine is being operated by vigo coal company inc the mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year 45 of the warrick power plant’s requirements the balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration 

in the pacific northwest alcoa has been operating under a contract with chelan county public utility district chelan pud located in the state of washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the wenatchee smelter through october 2011 in july 2008 alcoa and chelan pud executed a new contract which will begin in november 2011 and run through october 2028 under which alcoa will receive approximately 26 of the hydropower output of chelan pud’s rocky reach and rock island dams 

  

alcoa had a contract through september 2011 with the bonneville power administration bpa under which alcoa was receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power purchased from the market to partially operate the intalco smelter in december 2008 the 9 th circuit court of appeals issued its opinion in the pacific northwest generating cooperative v bpa case which invalidated the financial benefits portion of that arrangement in january 2009 alcoa and bpa executed a shortterm agreement running through september 2009 that transformed that arrangement into one consistent with the court’s opinion which interim contract was also invalidated by the same panel of the 9 th circuit court of appeals these two panel decisions are being appealed subsequently alcoa and bpa signed a new contract providing for the sale of physical power at the northwest power actmandated industrial firm power ip rate for the period from december 22 2009 – may 26 2011 17 months with provision for a 5year extension if certain financial tests can be met 

power for the rockdale smelter in texas was historically supplied from companyowned generating units and units owned by txu generation company lp now luminant generation company llc luminant both of which used lignite supplied by the company’s sandow mine upon completion of lignite mining in the sandow mine in 2005 lignite supply transitioned to the formerly alcoaowned three oaks mine the company retired its three whollyowned generating units at rockdale units 1 2 and 3 in late 2006 and transitioned to an arrangement under which luminant was to supply all of the rockdale smelter’s electricity requirements under a longterm power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038 with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price in june 2008 alcoa temporarily idled half of the capacity at the rockdale smelter due to electricity supply issues with luminant and in november 2008 curtailed the remainder of rockdale’s smelting capacity due to an unreliable power supply and overall market conditions in august 2008 alcoa filed suit in district court in cameron texas against luminant and certain of its parents and affiliates seeking damages for luminant’s alleged wrongful conduct that resulted in the electricity supply issues to the smelter trial is scheduled for may 2010 in august 2007 luminant and alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which luminant will construct own and operate a new circulating fluidized bed power plant adjacent to the existing sandow unit four power plant and in september 2007 on the sale of the three oaks mine to luminant 

in the northeast the purchased power contracts for both the massena east and massena west smelters in new york expire not earlier than june 30 2013 following their extension in 2003 for 10 years upon new york power authority nypa having relicensed its st lawrencefdr hydro project in december 2007 alcoa and nypa reached agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the massena east and massena west smelters for 30 years beginning on july 1 2013 the definitive agreement implementing this arrangement became effective february 24 2009 a subsequent amendment providing alcoa additional time to complete the design and engineering work for its massena east modernization plan and providing for the return of 256 megawatts of power to nypa while massena east is idled was entered into effective april 16 2009 implementation of the massena east modernization plan is subject to further approval of the alcoa board 

the mt holly smelter in south carolina purchases electricity from santee cooper under a contract that expires december 31 2015 subject to certain extension provisions 

at the end of 2005 all production was temporarily curtailed at the eastalco smelter located in frederick maryland the curtailment coincided with the expiration of the smelter’s power contract on december 31 2005 as a competitivelypriced replacement power supply could not be obtained alcoa continues efforts to find an alternative power source for eastalco 

australia – electricity 

power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a longterm mineral lease held by alcoa of australia limited aofa and that power currently provides approximately 40 of the electricity for the company’s smelter in point henry victoria the state electricity commission of victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the portland smelter under contracts with aofa that extend to 2014 and 2016 respectively work continues on new power arrangements that would begin upon the expiration of these power contracts 

  

brazil – electricity 

the alumar smelter is almost entirely supplied by eletronorte centrais elétricas do norte do brasil sa through a longterm power purchase agreement expiring in december 2024 eletronorte has supplied the alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984 alcoa alumínio sa’s alumínio remaining power needs for the smelter are supplied from the barra grande hydroelectric project 

alumínio owns a 3099 stake in maesa – machadinho energética sa which is the owner of 8306 of the machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern brazil alumínio’s share of the plant’s output is supplied to the poços de caldas smelter and is sufficient to cover 55 of its operating needs 

alumínio also has a 4218 interest in energética barra grande sa – baesa which built the barra grande hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil alumínio’s share of the power generated by baesa covers the remaining power needs of the poços de caldas smelter and a portion of the power needs of alumínio’s interest in the alumar smelter 

with machadinho and barra grande alumínio’s current power selfsufficiency is approximately 40 to meet a total energy demand of approximately 695 megawatts from brazilian primary plants 

alumínio is also participating in a number of other brazilian hydropower projects two of these projects have received the environmental license permits from the federal government and started construction in 2007 

 

  

 both projects are in the final stages of construction with serra do facão expected to begin generating power in the second quarter of 2010 and estreito in the first quarter of 2011 

the pai querê project in southern brazil alumínio’s share is 35 and the santa isabel project in northern brazil alumínio’s share is 20 are still in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses 

if these projects are completed the power will be used in alumínio’s smelters or sold into the brazilian grid 

europe – electricity 

until december 31 2005 the company purchased electricity for its smelters at portovesme and fusina italy under a power supply structure approved by the european commission ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government in 2005 italy granted an extension of the regulated electricity tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 in july 2006 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy complies with european union eu state aid rules on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in its investigation stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and ordered the italian government to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest alcoa is appealing this decision and is separately seeking an annulment of the ec’s decision to open its investigation regarding the italian power tariff extension additional details about this matter are in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report since january 1 2010 both the portovesme and fusina smelters have been supplied under shortterm bilateral contracts with power suppliers which do not give rise to future volume commitments for the smelters 

the company’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity under bilateral power contracts that commenced in may 2009 and are due to expire on december 31 2012 prior to the establishment of 

  

power supply under the bilateral contracts alcoa was supplied under a regulated power tariff on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa operated in spain for more than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system a decision by the ec has not yet been made if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts 

pursuant to the exchange arrangement with orkla previously described alcoa assumed 100 ownership of the two smelters in norway lista and mosjøen at the end of the first quarter of 2009 these smelters have longterm power arrangements in place which continue until at least 2019 

iceland – electricity 

alcoa’s fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland began operation in 2007 central to those operations is a 40year power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company built the kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter first power was supplied to the fjarðaál smelter in april 2007 and with the completion of the kárahnjúkar project in late 2007 the smelter achieved full production in april 2008 in late 2009 iceland imposed two new taxes on power intensive industries both for a period of 3 years from 2010 through 2012 one tax is based on energy consumption the other is a prepayment of certain other charges and will be recoverable from 2013 through 2015 

north america – natural gas 

in order to supply its refineries and smelters in the us and canada the company generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

australia – natural gas 

alcoa of australia aofa holds a 20 equity interest in a consortium that bought the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia aofa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries gas supply from apache northwest pty ltd and a separate joint venture in which apache is a participant was curtailed beginning in june 2008 following an explosion and fire at its varanus island gas processing plant supply was progressively restored beginning in august 2008 with full supply being returned in june 2009 the shortfall in gas supply from varanus island was covered by short term contracts with other gas producers and liquid fuels production at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries was not materially impacted 

patents trade secrets and trademarks 

the company believes that its domestic and international patent trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage the company’s rights under its patents as well as the products made and sold under them are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment the patents owned by alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques alcoa’s business as a whole is not however materially dependent on any single patent trade secret or trademark 

  

the company has a number of trade secrets mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets the company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits 

the company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served examples include the name “alcoa” and the alcoa symbol for aluminum products howmet metal castings huck ® fasteners kawneer building panels and durabright ® for wheels with dirt resistant surface treatments the company’s rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment 

competitive conditions 

alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and nonaluminum businesses competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets price quality and service are the principal competitive factors in alcoa’s markets where aluminum products compete with other materials – such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications magnesium titanium composites and plastics for aerospace and defense applications – aluminum’s diverse characteristics particularly its light weight recyclability and flexibility are also significant factors for alcoa’s segments that market products under alcoa’s brand names brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

research and development 

alcoa a technology leader in the aluminum industry engages in research and development programs that include process and product development and basic and applied research expenditures for research and development rd activities were 169 million in 2009 246 million in 2008 and 238 million in 2007 

most of the major process areas within the company have a technology management review board tmrb consisting of members from various worldwide locations each tmrb is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology alternatively certain business units conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit supported by the alcoa technical center atc technical personnel from the tmrbs atc and such business units also participate in the corresponding market sector teams in this manner research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals 

during 2009 the company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments in primary metals progress was made on inert anode technology with tests carried out on a “pilot scale” progress has been successful in many respects as a result of full pot testing of anode assemblies although there remain technical and cost targets to achieve if the technology proves to be commercially feasible the company believes that it would be able to convert its existing potlines to this new technology resulting in significant operating cost savings the new technology would also generate environmental benefits by reducing certain emissions and eliminating carbon dioxide no timetable has been established for commercial use progress was also made on carbothermic projects with pilot tests the projects if commercially feasible may reduce capital and energy costs as well as provide environmental benefits related to waste reduction 

in the semifabrication businesses national aeronautics and space administration nasa has certified alcoa’s davenport iowa facility as a supplier in the us to produce aluminumlithium alloy 2195 thin plate for the ares 1 crew launch vehicle the rocket that will enable astronauts to explore space first shipments have been made and successfully validated by nasa 

  

alcoa has also moved from the rd stage to “commercial scale” on its continuous castrolled micromill process the full width implementation at the san antonio texas facility has been successful with coils delivered to the market in addition a new process “sequential alloy casting” has been developed and products are being validated by the department of defense 

leveraging of new technologies such as biomimicry nano and low cost sensing continues to progress for example riblets that reduce aerodynamic drag sharkskin mimicry have been analyzed and produced on a test basis selfcleaning nano coatings have been demonstrated on building products energy saving sensing devices are being integrated in company manufacturing plants integrated thermal management products for consumer electronics have been developed and are being validated by our customers 

a number of products were commercialized in 2009 including dura bright ® wheels for commercial transport applications new alloy products and advanced fasteners for boeing 787 easy clean coatings for building products alloy 7085 for mold blocks unique surface sheet for the consumer electronics market lightweight highstrength applications for the defense market and high performance products such as drill pipes for the oil and gas markets 

for the aerospace market new multimaterial technologies continue to be developed to effectively compete with composites alcoa’s advanced aerospace alloys contributed to the successful operation of china’s first homeproduced regional jet arj21700 

the company currently has at least 60 new products in various development stages as a result of product development and technological advancement the company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world 

environmental matters 

information relating to environmental matters is included in the following sections of this report part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the caption “investing activities—environmental matters” on page 67 note a to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on page 82 and in note n to the consolidated financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on pages 110113 

employees 

total worldwide employment at yearend 2009 was approximately 59000 employees in 31 countries about 37000 of these employees are represented by labor unions the company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good 

in the us approximately 9000 employees are represented by various labor unions the master collective bargaining agreement between alcoa and the united steelworkers covering 10 locations and approximately 5600 us employees is scheduled to expire on may 31 2010 the parties will negotiate in may with the intent of reaching a new longterm agreement to the extent a new longterm agreement is not reached a work stoppage at some or all of the 10 locations could begin on june 1 2010 there are 18 other collective bargaining agreements in the us with varying expiration dates various collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover about 12000 employees in europe 5600 employees in russia 6200 employees in central and south america 3800 employees in australia 600 employees in china and 2200 employees in canada 

in 2009 alcoa reduced worldwide headcount by approximately 28000 as a result of temporary and permanent reductions in force and various divestures alcoa has lifted the global hiring and salary freezes that it instituted in 2009 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that could cause alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

recovery from the 2008  2009 global economic downturn and related disruptions in the financial markets and their impact on the aluminum industry and alcoa are uncertain 

the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in lme prices economic conditions generally and aluminum enduse markets the global economic downturn that occurred in 2008 and 2009 coupled with the global financial and credit market disruptions had a historic negative impact on the aluminum industry and alcoa these events contributed to an unprecedented decline 56 in the last five months of 2008 in lmebased aluminum prices weak end markets a sharp drop in demand increased global inventories and higher costs of borrowing andor diminished credit availability while alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum remain bright the company is unable to predict the timing and rate at which industry variables may recover the company implemented a number of operational and financial actions in 2009 to improve its cost structure and liquidity including curtailing production halting noncritical capital expenditures accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw materials divesting noncore assets reducing global headcount suspending its existing share repurchase program reducing its quarterly common stock dividend and making other liquidity enhancements however there can be no assurance that these actions or any others that the company has taken or may take will be sufficient to counter any continuation or reoccurrence of the downturn or disruptions in addition there can be no assurance that the measures taken by alcoa or their benefits will be sustainable in a changing or improving business environment a protracted continuation or worsening of the global economic downturn or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by declines in aluminum prices 

the price of aluminum is frequently volatile and changes in response to general economic conditions expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories the influence of hedge funds and other financial investment funds participating in commodity markets has also increased in recent years contributing to higher levels of price volatility at the same time there is often a lag effect for a reduction in lmelinked costs of production for example reduction of certain key smelting input costs such as alumina and power may lag declining average primary metal revenue by up to 90 days continued high lme inventories could lead to a reduction in the price of aluminum industry overcapacity including decisions by competitors to reactivate idle or build new capacity could contribute to a weak pricing environment a sustained weak aluminum pricing environment or a further deterioration in aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect upon alcoa’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

a reduction in demand or a lack of increased demand for aluminum by china or a combined number of other countries may negatively impact alcoa’s results 

the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for commodities including aluminum a sustained slowdown in china’s economic growth or the combined slowdown in other markets could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices in addition china’s investments to increase its selfsufficiency in key commodities may impact future demand and supply balances and prices 

  

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts the following could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects for decreases in commodity  or lme  linked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transporting raw materials to refining and smelting locations alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results will be affected by significant lag effects for declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in lmelinked costs of alumina and power in a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the brazilian real canadian dollar euro and australian dollar may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies while products generally are sold in us dollars 

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement or realize expected benefits from its growth projects or its portfolio streamlining strategy 

as a result of the global economic downturn and as part of the company’s initiative to conserve cash and preserve liquidity alcoa halted all noncritical capital investment in 2009 except for the completion of the são luís refinery expansion the greenfield juruti bauxite mine the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil and the china and russia growth projects however there can be no assurance that these projects will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to unfavorable global economic conditions increases in project startup costs for the juruti and são luís projects currency fluctuations or other factors or that the remaining construction on the estreito project will be completed within budget or by the targeted completion date 

alcoa has also made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and take other actions to streamline its portfolio for example in january 2009 alcoa announced its intention to sell its global foil and transportation products europe businesses there can be no assurance that these will be completed in their entirety as planned or 

  

beneficial to alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met in addition acquisitions present significant challenges and risks relating to the integration of the business into the company and there can be no assurances that the company will manage acquisitions successfully 

joint ventures and other strategic alliances may not be successful 

alcoa participates in joint ventures and has formed strategic alliances and may enter into additional such arrangements in the future for example in december 2009 alcoa announced that it formed a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop a fully integrated aluminum industry including a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill in the kingdom of saudi arabia although the company has in relation to that joint venture and its other existing joint ventures and strategic alliances sought to protect its interests joint ventures and strategic alliances necessarily involve special risks whether or not alcoa holds majority interests or maintains operational control in such arrangements its partners may 

 

  

  

  

 in addition the joint venture with ma’aden is subject to risks associated with large infrastructure construction projects including the risk of potential adverse changes in the financial markets that could affect the ability of the joint venture to implement its financing plans or to achieve financial close for the phases of the project and the consequences of noncompliance with the timeline and other requirements under the gas supply arrangements for the joint venture there can be no assurance that the project will be funded completed within budget or by the targeted completion date or that it or alcoa’s other joint ventures or strategic alliances will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to the abovedescribed risks unfavorable global economic conditions lack of financing increases in construction costs currency fluctuations political risks or other factors 

alcoa faces significant competition 

as discussed in part i item 1 business – competitive conditions of this report the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations in addition alcoa’s competitive position depends in part on the company’s access to an economical power supply to sustain its operations in various countries 

further metals industry consolidation could impact alcoa’s business 

the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted alcoa’s business further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict 

  

failure to maintain investment grade credit ratings will increase alcoa’s cost of borrowing and could further adversely affect alcoa’s access to the capital markets 

alcoa’s cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the shortand longterm debt ratings assigned to alcoa’s debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on the company’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios in february 2009 standard  poor’s ratings services sp and fitch ratings fitch each lowered alcoa’s longterm debt rating to bbb sp and fitch lowered the company’s shortterm debt ratings to a3 and f3 respectively and both indicated that the current outlook was negative also in february 2009 moody’s investors service moody’s lowered alcoa’s longterm debt rating to baa3 and the company’s shortterm debt rating to prime3 and indicated that the current outlook was stable although the company reduced debt and generated free cash flow in 2009 in december 2009 moody’s placed alcoa under review for further downgrade as a result of the company’s announced entry into a joint venture with ma’aden the saudi arabian mining company to develop an integrated aluminum complex in the kingdom of saudi arabia and slower than anticipated by moody’s recovery in earnings generation through 2009 despite higher than anticipated aluminum prices together with the more moderate pace of improvement in debt protection metrics debt reduction and balance sheet strength moody’s expressed concern that the joint venture investment may contribute to a delay in balance sheet improvement and debt reduction for alcoa given moody’s expectation for only slow recovery in the aluminum industry and in alcoa’s earnings although the company has available to it a committed revolving credit facility to provide liquidity the 2009 downgrades in alcoa’s credit ratings as well as any additional downgrades including below investment grade level will increase alcoa’s cost of borrowing and could have a further adverse effect on its access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part its access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for the company an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

alcoa could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under committed credit facilities 

as discussed in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources of this report alcoa has a committed revolving credit facility with financial institutions available for its use for which the company pays commitment fees the facility is provided by a syndicate of several financial institutions with each institution agreeing severally and not jointly to make revolving credit loans to alcoa in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement if one or more of the financial institutions providing the committed credit facility were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment the portion of the committed facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to the company 

alcoa may not be able to successfully realize expected shortterm benefits from changes in its pricing strategy for the aluminum can sheet market 

recently alcoa adopted changes to its pricing strategy for the aluminum can sheet market in north america in order to ensure the longterm profitability of the business the company eliminated metal price ceilings from its contracts and in new contracts is sharing with its customers increased costs of the business to improve its profitability these decisions are designed to allow alcoa to achieve financial returns that can support the business in the longterm and may have a negative effect on volume in the shortterm 

alcoa’s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks commercial instability and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries outside the us having varying degrees of political and economic risk including china guinea and russia among others risks include those associated with political instability civil unrest expropriation nationalization renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements mining leases and permits commercial instability caused by corruption and changes in local government laws regulations and 

  

policies including those related to tariffs and trade barriers taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition or operating results 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in us federal state or foreign law regulation or policy 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or outcomes of significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa the company may experience a change in effective tax rate or become subject to unexpected or rising costs associated with business operations or provision of health or welfare benefits to employees due to changes in laws regulations or policies the company is also subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time in addition various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment a significant settlement significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law a future adverse ruling or settlement or unfavorable changes in laws regulations or policies or other contingencies that the company cannot predict with certainty could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or cash flows in a particular period for additional information regarding the legal proceedings involving the company see the discussion in part i item 3 legal proceedings of this report and in note n to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future environmental matters for which we may be liable may arise in the future at our present sites where no problem is currently known  at previously owned sites sites previously operated by us sites owned by our predecessors or sites that we may acquire in the future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to several sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

  

climate change climate change legislation or regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that energy consumption is a contributor to global warming greenhouse effects and potential climate change 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change including pending us legislation that if enacted would limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits among other provisions in addition the environmental protection agency has for the first time required large emitters of greenhouse gases to collect and report data with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers or alcoa’s supply chain inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates the company may realize increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations costs to purchase or profits from sales of allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by the company and indirectly from changes in costs of goods sold 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns shortages of water or other natural resources changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 

alcoa’s estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality alcoa’s results of operations liquidity or shareholders’ equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

some of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the us and other countries when they expire including the master collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers that is scheduled to expire on may 31 2010 in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

  

alcoa’s human resource talent pool may not be adequate to support the company’s growth 

alcoa’s existing operations and development projects require highly skilled staff with relevant industry and technical experience the inability of the company and industry to attract and retain such people may adversely impact alcoa’s ability to adequately meet project demands and fill roles in existing operations skills shortages in engineering technical service construction and maintenance contractors may also impact activities these shortages may adversely impact the cost and schedule of development projects and the cost and efficiency of existing operations 

alcoa may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies and deployment of companywide business process models such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode and carbothermic technology in addition to multialloy casting processes there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

alcoa’s business and growth prospects may be negatively impacted by reductions in its capital expenditures 

in response to the global economic downturn and related disruptions in the financial markets alcoa changed its capital expenditures strategy in 2009 as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible and all noncritical capital expenditures were stopped capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa’s compliance with the law keep a facility operating or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs 

alcoa requires substantial capital to invest in greenfield and brownfield projects and to maintain and prolong the life and capacity of its existing facilities if demand for aluminum improves alcoa’s ability to take advantage of that improvement may be constrained by earlier capital expenditure restrictions and the longterm value of its business could be adversely impacted the company’s position in relation to its competitors may also deteriorate 

alcoa may also need to address commercial and political issues in relation to its reductions in capital expenditure in certain of the jurisdictions in which it operates if alcoa’s interest in its joint ventures is diluted or it loses key concessions its growth could be constrained any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations financial condition and prospects 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance further existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

the above list of important factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

  

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites 

as previously reported since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena new york plant site under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of cercla sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb in early 2002 alcoa submitted a revised analysis of alternatives report to epa this report identified potential remedial actions related to pcb contamination of the river including additional remedial alternatives that may be required by epa it also reflected certain recent studies and investigations on the river including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report was between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes because the selection of the 2 million alternative natural recovery was considered remote the company adjusted the reserve for the grasse river in 2002 to 30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives as no single alternative within that range could be identified as more probable than the others in june 2003 based on then recent river observations epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered the results of these additional studies submitted in a report to epa in april 2004 suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios those evaluations were submitted to epa along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river in may 2004 epa approved alcoa’s proposed remedial options pilot study rops that includes sediment removal and capping the installation of an ice control structure and significant monitoring at the same time alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the 35 million estimated cost of the rops in addition to the 30 million previously reserved most of the construction work for the rops was completed in 2005 with monitoring through 2008 the reserves for the grasse river were reevaluated in the fourth quarter of 2006 and an adjustment of 4 million was made this adjustment covered commitments made to the epa for additional investigation work for the ongoing monitoring program including that associated with the rops program to prepare a revised analysis of alternatives report and for an interim measure that involves annually the mechanical ice breaking of the river to prevent the formation of ice jams until a permanent remedy is selected epa has since eliminated the ice breaking requirement the findings from the rops program and from these additional investigations were incorporated into a revised analysis of alternatives report that was submitted to epa in 2008 this update incorporated new information obtained from the rops regarding the feasibility and costs associated with various capping and dredging alternatives and incorporated various options for ice control epa will use this information to develop a remedy for the river alcoa adjusted the reserve in the fourth quarter of 2008 by an additional 40 million for increases associated with updated cost for a proposed remedy incorporating ice control and for settlement of potential resource damages the epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the epa’s record of decision is issued which is expected in late 2010 or later

as previously reported in july 2006 the european commission ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated electricity tariff granted by italy to some energyintensive industries complies with european union eu state aid rules the italian power tariff extended the tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 through november 19 2009 alcoa incurred higher power costs of 23 million pretax at its smelters in italy between the tariff end date and december 31 2009 the extension was originally through 2010 but the date was changed by legislation adopted by the italian parliament effective on august 15 2009 prior to expiration 

  

of the tariff in 2005 alcoa had been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure provided a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and was not considered state aid from the italian government the ec’s announcement expressed concerns about whether italy’s extension of the tariff beyond 2005 was compatible with eu legislation and potentially distorted competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs 

on november 19 2009 the ec announced a decision in this matter stating that the extension of the tariff by italy constituted unlawful state aid in part and therefore the italian government is to recover a portion of the benefit alcoa received since january 2006 including interest the amount of this recovery will be based on a calculation that is being prepared by the italian government pending notification from the italian government alcoa estimates that a payment in the range of 300 million to 500 million will be required during 2010 alcoa is preparing to appeal this decision to the general court of the eu and will pursue all substantive and procedural legal steps available to it to annul the ec’s decision including seeking injunctive relief to suspend the effectiveness of the decision after discussions with legal counsel and reviewing the bases on which the ec decided including the different considerations cited in the ec decision regarding alcoa’s two smelters in italy alcoa recorded a charge of 250 million including 20 million to writeoff a receivable from the italian government for amounts due under the now expired tariff structure

as previously reported on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it had opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa has been operating in spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies the investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit 

  

observations and comments to the ec with respect to the energyintensive consumers the ec opened the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than the pool price mechanism therefore being in principle artificially below market conditions alcoa submitted comments in which the company provided evidence that prices paid by energyintensive consumers were in line with the market in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in the tariff system alcoa believes that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision would be approximately 12 million €8 million pretax while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005 it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years a decision by the ec is expected in 2010 if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts

lme and priced daily based on market supply and demand aluminum and alumina represent more than threefourths of alcoa’s revenues and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft automobiles commercial transportation packaging building and construction oil and gas defense and industrial applications 

alcoa is a global company operating in 31 countries based upon the country where the point of sale occurred the us and europe generated 52 and 27 respectively of alcoa’s sales in 2009 in addition alcoa has investments and operating activities in australia brazil china iceland guinea russia and the kingdom of saudi arabia all of which present opportunities for substantial growth governmental policies laws and regulations and other economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates affect the results of operations in these countries 

management review of 2009 and outlook for the future 

in 2009 management was faced with the challenge of preserving alcoa’s future while navigating the company through a global economic downturn that coupled an unprecedented decline in lme pricing levels began in the second half of 2008 with a collapse in demand from aluminum product end markets management adopted a holistic response to this situation by initiating various actions including curtailing additional refinery and smelter capacity necessitating further layoffs instituting programs to identify procurement efficiencies overhead rationalization and working capital improvements reducing the quarterly common stock dividend and issuing new equity and debt instruments all of these actions were aimed at reducing costs improving cash levels and preserving liquidity certain financial and nonfinancial information reflecting these challenges and management’s actions were as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in 2010 management expects market conditions for aluminum products in certain end markets to improve particularly in automotive and commercial transportation while others are expected to decline including aerospace building and construction and industrial gas turbines management is also projecting an increase in the consumption of primary aluminum especially in china on the cost side increases in energy prices and continued currency movements are expected to be a challenge management is committed to achieving the following goals in 2010 

 

  

   

 results of operations 

earnings summary 

loss from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2009 was 985 or 106 per diluted share compared with income from continuing operations of 229 or 027 per share in 2008 the change of 1214 in continuing operations was primarily due to the following significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum large volume decreases in the downstream segments a charge associated with electricity pricing in italy a loss on the sale of an equity investment charges related to the 2009 restructuring program and higher depreciation and interest charges all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses the absence of the charges associated with the 2008 restructuring program net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar favorable lifo last in first out inventory adjustments various discrete income tax benefits and a significant fluctuation in income taxes due to a change in the results of operations from pretax income to a pretax loss a gain on the exchange of equity interests a gain on the acquisition of an entity in the republic of suriname and net income of various other nonoperating items 

income from continuing operations attributable to alcoa for 2008 was 229 or 027 per diluted share compared with 2814 or 322 per share in 2007 the decrease in income from continuing operations was mostly due to the following the absence of the gain related to the sale of alcoa’s investment in aluminum corporation of china limited chalco charges for the 2008 restructuring program continued increases in raw materials energy and other inputs net unfavorable foreign currency movements the absence of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment for 10 months and costs associated with a gas outage in western australia and a complete smelter curtailment in rockdale tx these negative impacts were slightly offset by the absence of the following items that occurred in 2007 charges for the 2007 restructuring program certain costs associated with the rockdale tennessee and iceland smelters and transaction costs and interest charges related to a potential business combination 

net loss attributable to alcoa for 2009 was 1151 or 123 per diluted share compared with a net loss of 74 or 010 per share in 2008 and net income of 2564 or 294 per share in 2007 in 2009 and 2008 the net loss of 1151 and 74 included a loss from discontinued operations of 166 and 303 respectively all related to the ees business in 2007 net income of 2564 included a loss from discontinued operations of 250 comprised of a 243 loss related to the ees business and a 7 net loss of other discontinued businesses 

in march 2009 alcoa announced a series of operational and financial actions which were in addition to those announced at the end of 2008 to significantly improve alcoa’s cost structure and liquidity operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from 017 per share to 003 per share which began with the dividend paid on may 25 2009 and the issuance of 1725 million shares of common stock and 575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded 1438 in net proceeds 

in late 2008 management made the decision to reduce alcoa’s aluminum and alumina production in response to the significant economic downturn as a result of this decision reductions of 750 kmt or 18 of annualized output from alcoa’s global smelting system were implemented includes previous curtailment at rockdale tx in june 2008 accordingly reductions in alumina output were also initiated with a plan to reduce production by 1500 kmtperyear across the global refining system the aluminum and alumina production curtailments were completed in early 2009 as planned smelters in rockdale 267 kmtperyear and tennessee 215 kmtperyear were fully curtailed while another 268 kmtperyear was partially curtailed at various other locations the refinery in point comfort tx was partially curtailed by approximately 1500 kmt peryear between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 only approximately half of this amount remains curtailed as of december 31 2009 in mid2009 further action became 

  

necessary resulting in the decision to fully curtail the massena east ny smelter 125 kmtperyear and partially curtail the suralco suriname refinery 480 kmtperyear – represented awac’s previous 55 ownership interest at the time of curtailment – total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt 

in june 2008 alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production three of six operating potlines or 120 kmt at its rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale’s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues in september 2008 alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines or 147 kmt as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter wellknown issues regarding the cost and longterm reliability of the power supply and overall market conditions in 2008 the earnings impact of the idled potlines was 55 90 pretax alcoa is seeking damages and other relief from its power supplier through ongoing litigation additionally in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines alcoa recorded restructuring charges in 2008 of 31 48 pretax mostly for the layoff of approximately 870 employees see restructuring and other charges below for additional information 

also in june 2008 a major gas supplier to alcoa’s western australia refining operations part of alcoa of australia suffered a pipeline rupture and fire which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier’s gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers the disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in alcoa of australia’s production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations as a result shortly thereafter alcoa of australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts during the second half of 2008 the supplier partially restored the gas supply to alcoa of australia full restoration occurred in the first half of 2009 in addition insurance recoveries of 52 were received in the second half of 2008 net of insurance benefits alcoa’s earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was 49 102 before tax and noncontrolling interest in 2008 the alumina segment was impacted by 33 47 before tax and the remaining impact of 29 55 before tax was reflected in corporate due to alcoa’s captive insurance program in 2009 additional insurance recoveries of 24 were received which benefited the results of alcoa by 10 24 before tax and noncontrolling interest and the alumina segment by 17 24 before tax alcoa of australia is part of alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac which is 60 owned by alcoa and 40 owned by alumina limited 

sales— sales for 2009 were 18439 compared with sales of 26901 in 2008 a decline of 8462 or 31 the decrease was primarily due to a drop in realized prices for alumina and aluminum driven by significantly lower london metal exchange lme prices volume declines in the downstream segments due to continued weak end markets unfavorable foreign currency movements mostly the result of a weaker euro and australian dollar and the absence of sales from the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment 516 in 2008 all of which was slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in norway 

sales for 2008 were 26901 compared with sales of 29280 in 2007 a decline of 2379 or 8 the decrease was driven mainly by the absence of 10 months of sales 2781 from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment the absence of sales from the soft alloy extrusion business 1115 in 2007 and volume declines for most downstream businesses especially related to the automotive and commercial transportation markets in north america and europe these negative impacts were principally offset by significantly higher primary aluminum volumes mostly as a result of sales related to the production of the iceland smelter for a full year and favorable foreign currency movements primarily due to a stronger euro and australian dollar 

cost of goods sold— cogs as a percentage of sales was 917 in 2009 compared with 824 in 2008 the percentage was negatively impacted by significant declines in realized prices for alumina and aluminum lower demand in the downstream segments and a charge related to a recent european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 these items were somewhat offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all businesses net favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and positive lifo adjustments in 2009 alcoa recognized 361 235 aftertax in income due to the reductions in lifo inventory quantities and the considerable drop in lme prices of this amount 71 occurred in the second half of the year during 2010 

  

management expects to maintain inventory levels comparable to 2009 however this will not generate lifo income in the first quarter of 2010 and is not expected to generate lifo income for the remainder of 2010 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 824 in 2008 compared with 779 in 2007 the increase in the percentage was mainly the result of continued cost increases in raw materials energy and other inputs unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker us dollar the production at the iceland smelter that did not occur in 2007 and the impacts of the gas outage in western australia and the 2008 smelter curtailment at rockdale these items were primarily offset by the absence of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment for 10 months 840 the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business 971 in 2007 productivity improvements in most of the businesses within the engineered products and solutions segment and the absence of certain costs incurred in 2007 as a result of production curtailments associated with the tennessee and rockdale smelters and startup costs at the iceland smelter among others 

selling general administrative and other expenses— sga expenses were 1009 or 55 of sales in 2009 compared with 1167 or 43 of sales in 2008 the decline of 158 was primarily due to reductions in labor costs mainly as a result of implemented severance programs decreases in expenses for travel contractors and consultants information technology selling and marketing and various other administrative items as part of alcoa’s cost reduction initiatives the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment 37 in 2008 and a decrease in bad debt expense all of which was partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation mostly the result of the plans’ improved performance and an increase due to sga of the acquired smelters in norway 

sga expenses were 1167 or 43 of sales in 2008 compared with 1444 or 49 of sales in 2007 the decrease of 277 was mostly due to the absence of 10 months of expenses 180 from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment the absence of transaction costs related to the 2007 offer for alcan inc 46 and the absence of expenses from the soft alloy extrusion business 33 in 2007 

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 169 in 2009 compared with 246 in 2008 and 238 in 2007 the decline in 2009 as compared to 2008 was principally due to the implementation of alcoa’s cost reduction initiatives and the absence of the businesses within the former packaging and consumer segment 3 in 2008 the increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 was mainly driven by expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the flatrolled products segment and the primary metals segment partially offset by the absence of 10 months of expenditures 16 from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1311 in 2009 compared with 1234 in 2008 the increase of 77 or 6 was mostly due to the acquired smelters in norway and assets placed into service during 2009 including the juruti bauxite mine and são luis refinery in brazil the new bohai china flatrolled product facility and a highquality coated sheet line at the samara russia facility these increases were slightly offset as a result of the cessation of dda which began in january 2009 related to the global foil and transportation products europe businesses due to the classification of these businesses as held for sale and a reduction in dda as a result of the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review which was completed in mid2008 of estimated useful lives 11 

the provision for dda was 1234 in 2008 compared with 1244 in 2007 the decline of 10 or 1 was principally the result of the absence of nine months of depreciation from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment 89 in 2007 which was classified as held for sale and the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of refining and smelting locations and various rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review of estimated useful lives completed during 2008 61 offsetting these reductions was a significant increase 83 in depreciation expense related to the iceland smelter and norway anode facility being in service for a full year and unfavorable foreign currency movements as a result of a weaker us dollar

 interest expense— interest expense was 470 in 2009 compared with 407 in 2008 resulting in an increase of 63 or 15 the increase was primarily due to a 10 higher average debt level mostly the result of 575 in convertible notes issued in march 2009 and increased borrowings on loans in brazil began in april 2008 related to the juruti são luís and estreito growth projects and a significant increase in the amortization of debt costs mainly due to a 66 beneficial conversion option related to the convertible notes and 43 in fees paid for the 1900 364day senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in october 2008 and expired in october 2009 both of which were slightly offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of alcoa’s debt portfolio 

interest expense was 407 in 2008 compared with 401 in 2007 resulting in an increase of 6 or 1 the increase was principally caused by a 22 higher average debt level mostly due to the issuance of 1500 in new senior notes in july 2008 and significantly higher commercial paper levels and a decrease in capitalized interest 32 primarily due to placing growth projects into service such as the iceland smelter and the norway anode facility in 2007 these items were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the 2007 offer for alcan inc 67 and a lower weightedaverage effective interest rate driven mainly by the decrease in libor rates 

  

other income net— other income net was 161 in 2009 compared with 59 in 2008 the increase of 102 was mainly the result of a 188 gain on the elkemsapa ab exchange transaction favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar net gains related to the improvement in the cash surrender value of companyowned life insurance an 92 gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and a 22 gain on the sale of property in vancouver wa these positive impacts were partially offset by a 182 realized loss on the sale of the shining prospect investment a decline in the value of marktomarket derivative contracts a decrease in equity income related to alcoa’s share of the results of elkem sapa ab and shining prospect prior to the exchange and sale of these investments the absence of a 2008 negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment 39 and an estimated loss on excess power at the ferndale wa smelter 30 

other income net was 59 in 2008 compared with 1920 in 2007 the decrease of 1861 was mostly due to the absence of the 1754 gain related to the sale of alcoa’s investment in chalco other items impacting this decline were losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar the absence of dividend income from alcoa’s former stake in chalco and the absence of a nonrecurring foreign currency gain in russia all of which was partially offset by marktomarket gains on derivative contracts and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior alcoa divestiture 39 

income taxes— alcoa’s effective tax rate was 383 benefit on a loss in 2009 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily due to a 12 income tax benefit related to the noncontrolling interests’ share of the gain associated with the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the following discrete tax items a 71 benefit for the reorganization of an equity investment a 34 benefit for the reversal of a valuation allowance on foreign deferred tax assets a 31 benefit for a tax rate change from 15 to 18 in iceland a 31 benefit related to a canadian tax law change allowing a tax return to be filed in us dollars a 10 benefit related to a change in the sale structure of two locations included in the global foil business than originally anticipated and a 7 benefit related to the elkemsapa ab exchange transaction partially offsetting these benefits were items related to smelter operations in italy which included a 41 valuation allowance placed on existing deferred tax assets and charges not tax benefitted as follows 250 related to a recent decision by the european commission on electricity pricing 15 for environmental remediation and 15 for layoffs 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 432 provision on income in 2008 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the following income tax charges 73 for the asset impairments included in the 2008 restructuring program 28 due to a decrease in deferred tax assets of the iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change from 18 to 15 a net 19 associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations these charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a 20 discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the 2007 us income tax return 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 338 provision on income in 2007 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 the effective tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to lower taxes on foreign income mostly offset by a discrete income tax charge of 142 related to goodwill that is nondeductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2010 will be approximately 35 however changes in the current economic environment tax legislation currency fluctuations and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate significantly 

noncontrolling interests— net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 61 in 2009 compared with 221 in 2008 the decline of 160 was principally due to lower earnings at awac which is owned 60 by alcoa and 40 by alumina limited the lower earnings at awac were mainly driven by a significant drop in realized prices 

  

somewhat offset by the gain related to the acquisition of a bhp billiton subsidiary in the republic of suriname and the absence of the impact of the 2008 gas outage in western australia 

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was 221 in 2008 compared with 365 in 2007 the decrease of 144 was mostly due to lower earnings at awac attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar and the impact of the gas outage in western australia 

loss from discontinued operations— loss from discontinued operations in 2009 was 166 comprised of a 129 168 pretax loss on the divestiture of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business a 9 13 pretax loss on the divestiture of the electronics portion of the ees business and the remainder was for the operational results of the ees business prior to the divestitures 

loss from discontinued operations in 2008 was 303 comprised of asset impairments of 162 225 pretax to reflect the estimated fair value of the ees business and a net operating loss of 141 199 pretax which included restructuring charges of 39 53 pretax for headcount reductions of approximately 6200 and a charge of 16 25 pretax for obsolete inventory 

loss from discontinued operations in 2007 was 250 comprised of a 243 loss related to the ees business including severance charges of 36 53 pretax for headcount reductions of approximately 5900 as part of a strategic business review to restructure ees and impairment charges of 93 133 pretax for goodwill and 60 74 pretax for various fixed assets as the forecasted future earnings and cash flows of the ees business no longer supported the carrying values of such assets an 11 loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the 2006 sale of the home exteriors business and net operating income of 4 for other discontinued businesses 

in late 2008 alcoa reclassified the ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to sell the business the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the ees business in discontinued operations the sale of the wire harness and electrical portion of the ees business was completed in june 2009 and the sale of the electronics portion of the ees business was completed in december 2009 the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of the ees business into discontinued operations 

segment information 

in may 2009 management approved the movement of alcoa’s hard alloy extrusions business from the flatrolled products segment to the engineered products and solutions segment this move was made to capture market customer and manufacturer synergies through the combination of the hard alloy extrusions business with the power and propulsion and forgings businesses prior period amounts were reclassified to reflect this change 

alcoa’s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments alumina primary metals flatrolled products and engineered products and solutions the packaging and consumer segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 2008 segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting interest income and expense noncontrolling interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges discontinued operations and other items including intersegment profit eliminations and other metal adjustments differences between tax rates applicable to the segments and the consolidated effective tax rate the results of the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gainslosses are excluded from segment atoi segment assets exclude among others cash and cash equivalents deferred income taxes goodwill not allocated to businesses for segment reporting purposes corporate fixed assets lifo reserves and assets classified as held for sale related to discontinued operations 

  

atoi for all reportable segments totaled 234 in 2009 2199 in 2008 and 3162 in 2007 see note q to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 for additional information the following discussion provides shipments sales and atoi data for each reportable segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2009 

alumina 

 

 this segment consists of alcoa’s worldwide alumina system including the mining of bauxite which is then refined into alumina alumina is mainly sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is sold to customers that process it into industrial chemical products a portion of this segments’s thirdparty sales are completed through the use of agents alumina traders and distributors slightly more than half of alcoa’s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally 

in 2009 alumina production decreased by 991 kmt compared to 2008 the reduction was mostly the result of the effects of curtailments initiated in late 2008 through early 2009 which included approximately 1500 kmtperyear at the point comfort tx refinery only approximately half of this amount remains curtailed as of december 31 2009 and approximately 480 kmtperyear at the suralco suriname refinery represented awac’s previous 55 ownership interest at the time of curtailment – total curtailed is approximately 870 kmt partially offsetting the curtailments was increased production at the following refineries all set production records in 2009 jamalco jamaica pinjarra and wagerup australia and são luis brazil where rampup of the 2100 kmt expansion began in late 2009 production also increased due to additional capacity of approximately 600 kmt from the acquisition total acquired was approximately 990 kmt – 390 was curtailed of bhp billiton’s 45 interest in suralco on july 31 2009 100 of the suralco refinery’s operations were reflected in this segment beginning august 1 2009 in 2008 alumina production increased by 172 kmt compared to 2007 with the largest increase occurring at the pinjarra refinery due to the continued positive effects of the efficiency upgrade expansion completed in 2006 in late 2008 alcoa reduced production at its point comfort refinery by 550 kmtperyear due to negative market conditions however production for the year slightly exceeded the refinery’s 2007 production performance 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment declined 26 in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to a 35 drop in realized prices driven by significantly lower lme prices and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker australian dollar both of which were somewhat offset by an increase in volumes thirdparty sales for this segment rose 8 in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily related to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger australian dollar and increases of 3 and 2 in thirdparty shipments and realized prices respectively 

intersegment sales for the alumina segment dropped 45 in 2009 compared with 2008 mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a reduction in demand from the primary metals segment intersegment sales for this segment climbed 15 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly as a result of a 6 increase in volumes and higher realized prices 

atoi for the alumina segment declined 85 in 2009 compared with 2008 principally due to the significant drop in realized prices a tax settlement related to an equity investment in brazil 30 and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of growth projects placed into service midtolate 2009 in brazil juruti bauxite mine and são luis refinery all of which was partially offset by net procurement and overhead cost savings across most regions favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar a 60 gain recognized on the acquisition of bhp billiton’s interest 

  

in suralco and a positive impact related to the 2008 gas outage in western australia absence of 69 in costs partially offset by 19 less in insurance recoveries atoi for this segment decreased 24 in 2008 compared with 2007 mostly due to significant cost increases for bauxite caustic soda fuel oil and natural gas unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar and the impact of the gas outage in western australia 33 net of insurance benefits all of which was partially offset by higher realized prices productivity improvements and a positive impact due to the curtailment of production at the point comfort refinery 

in 2010 increased benefits from cost savings initiatives are expected and improved customer demand is anticipated especially in china as indicated by the significant increase in shipments in late 2009 also higher production levels due to the startup of the juruti bauxite mine total additional 2600 kmt of bauxite alcoa’s share is 1560 kmt and são luis refinery total additional alumina production of 2100 kmt alcoa’s share is 948 kmt are expected while full production at these facilities will result in higher depreciation expense 

primary metals 

 

 this segment consists of alcoa’s worldwide smelter system primary metals receives alumina primarily from the alumina segment and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa’s fabricating businesses as well as sold to external customers aluminum traders and commodity markets results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess power are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales 

at december 31 2009 alcoa had 1234 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4813 kmt in 2009 idle capacity increased by 480 kmt compared to 2008 due to the completion of targeted curtailment reductions including 215 kmt at the tennessee smelter 125 kmt at the massena east ny smelter and 140 kmt at various other smelters in response to the significant decline in lme prices and aluminum demand both as a result of the global economic downturn base capacity rose by 282 kmt at december 31 2009 as compared to december 31 2008 due to the march 31 2009 acquisition of two smelters in norway in which alcoa previously held a 50 equity interest at december 31 2008 alcoa had 754 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4531 kmt in 2008 idle capacity increased by 302 kmt as compared to 2007 due to the complete production curtailment at rockdale tx 267 kmt and partial curtailments of approximately 35 kmt related to other smelters all of which were the result of negative market conditions base capacity dropped by 42 kmt at december 31 2008 as compared to december 31 2007 primarily driven by 53 kmt permanently curtailed in november 2008 at the baie comeau smelter as part of a modernization program initiated early due to the global economic downturn 

in 2009 aluminum production declined 443 kmt mainly the result of the effects of smelter curtailments that began mid2008 including the smelters in rockdale 267 kmtperyear tennessee 215 kmtperyear and massena east 125 kmtperyear all of which was partially offset by an increase in production at the iceland smelter 344 kmtperyear as this smelter was not at full capacity until april 2008 and the acquisition of the lista 94 kmtperyear and mosjøen 188 kmtperyear smelters in norway in 2008 aluminum production increased by 314 kmt mostly due to the iceland smelter as 2008 was its first full year of production the ferndale smelter as a result of the restart of additional pots early in the year and the tennessee smelter all of which was slightly offset by a reduction 

  

at the rockdale smelter due to alcoa’s decision to curtail all production at this facility until competitive market conditions return 267kmtperyear in late 2008 alcoa started partial production curtailments at various smelters including ferndale and baie comeau quebec resulting in an additional decline of 350 kmtperyear 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment decreased 35 in 2009 compared with 2008 mostly the result of a 32 drop in realized prices driven by a 35 decline in lme prices slightly offset by sales from the acquired smelters in norway thirdparty sales for this segment climbed 22 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly due to higher volumes primarily the result of the sales related to the production from the iceland smelter shipments made to the packaging and consumer businesses subsequent to their divestiture in 2008 and shipments made in the first half of 2008 to the sapa ab joint venture shipments to alcoa’s soft alloy extrusion business were included in intersegment sales in the first half of 2007 somewhat offset by lower realized prices of 3 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment declined 53 in 2009 compared with 2008 mostly due to a drop in realized prices and a decline in volume due to lower demand from the downstream segments intersegment sales for this segment decreased 21 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly as a result of lower demand from alcoa’s downstream businesses the absence of 10 months of shipments to the packaging and consumer businesses that occurred in 2007 and the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in 2007 

atoi for the primary metals segment declined 1543 in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily due to the significant drop in realized prices a charge related to a recent european commission’s decision on electricity pricing for smelters in italy 250 a decline in intersegment sales volume the impact of curtailing operations and additional power costs related to smelters in italy as a result of the termination of the then existing power tariff structure under legislative authority of the italian parliament 15 all of which was partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings across all regions lower costs for alumina favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar and a gain related to the acquisition of two smelters in norway 112 atoi for this segment dropped 36 in 2008 compared with 2007 principally related to higher alumina carbon and energy costs increased spending on repairs and maintenance outside services and labor lower realized prices the impact of the 2008 curtailment of all production at rockdale 55 and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar these negative impacts were partially offset by the absence of costs incurred in 2007 associated with the following the startup of the iceland smelter the smelter production curtailment of one of the potlines in rockdale and the smelter curtailment associated with the power outage in tennessee 

in 2010 continued benefits from cost savings initiatives are expected however two smelters in italy fusina and portovesme – 194 kmtperyear may be fully curtailed due to uneconomical power rates 

flatrolled products 

 

 this segment’s principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate sheet and foil this segment includes rigid container sheet rcs which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans seasonal increases in rcs sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year this segment also includes sheet and plate used in the transportation building and construction and distribution markets mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables which is sold directly to customers and through distributors approximately onethird of the thirdparty sales in this segment consist of rcs while the remaining twothirds of thirdparty sales are derived from sheet and plate and foil used in 

  

industrial markets while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of rcs sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers 

thirdparty sales for the flatrolled products segment declined 32 in 2009 compared with 2008 the decrease was primarily due to a drop in prices attributable to unfavorable changes in the variable components of certain customer contracts and a reduction in volumes across most businesses both of which were mostly the result of weak end markets in europe and north america and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro and australian dollar thirdparty sales for this segment decreased 4 in 2008 compared with 2007 the decline was principally due to lower volumes across all businesses mainly the result of weak end markets in north america and europe partially offset by positive foreign currency movements mostly due to a stronger euro and a favorable pricing and product mix 

atoi for the flatrolled products segment fell 46 in 2009 compared with 2008 primarily as a result of reduced volumes across most businesses the previously mentioned drop in prices and an increase in depreciation expense as a result of the new coating line commissioned in samara russia and the new flatrolled product facility in bohai china all of these items were mostly offset by procurement and overhead cost savings and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger us dollar atoi for this segment declined 181 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly the result of continued higher direct materials energy and other cost increases and lower volumes across all businesses partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix 

in 2010 continued benefits from cost savings initiatives are anticipated while higher energy costs are expected also can sheet volumes are expected to decline significantly in north america the largest market for can sheet due to a change in pricing strategy which will allow cost increases to be passed on to customers the decision to reduce volumes particularly in the first quarter will provide longerterm profitability for this business further management continues to explore divestiture alternatives for the remaining global foil business the sabiñánigo spain and shanghai china plants were sold in late 2009 

engineered products and solutions 

 

 this segment includes titanium aluminum and super alloy investment castings forgings and fasteners aluminum wheels integrated aluminum structural systems and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace automotive building and construction commercial transportation and power generation markets these products are sold directly to customers and through distributors additionally hard alloy extrusions products which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors serve the distribution aerospace automotive and commercial transportation markets 

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment declined 24 in 2009 compared with 2008 the decrease was mostly due to lower volumes aluminum and nonaluminum across all businesses because of weak end markets lower pricing in the building and construction sector and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker euro thirdparty sales for this segment increased 6 in 2008 compared with 2007 the improvement was primarily due to higher demand in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets favorable pricing in the building and construction market positive foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro and the addition of two fastener businesses acquired in early 2008 all of which was partially offset by significant volume declines in the commercial transportation market 

atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment fell 41 in 2009 compared with 2008 principally the result of lower volumes across all businesses and lower pricing partially offset by procurement and overhead cost savings 

  

realized in all businesses atoi for this segment climbed 23 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly due to continued strong demand and productivity improvements in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro and the positive contribution of the acquired fastener businesses all of which was somewhat offset by significantly lower volumes in the commercial transportation market 

in 2010 continued benefits from cost savings initiatives are anticipated however weak end markets and destocking in the aerospace fastener and industrial gas turbine markets are expected to continue also management continues to explore divestiture alternatives for the transportation products europe business 

packaging and consumer 

 

 the businesses within this segment were sold to rank group limited in 2008 therefore this segment no longer contains any operations prior to the sale of these businesses this segment included consumer foodservice and flexible packaging products food and beverage closures and plastic sheet and film for the packaging industry the principal products in this segment included aluminum foil plastic wraps and bags plastic beverage and food closures flexible packaging products thermoformed plastic containers and extruded plastic sheet and film consumer products were marketed under brands including reynolds wrap ®  diamond ®  baco ®  and cutrite ®  seasonal increases generally occurred in the second and fourth quarters of the year for such products as consumer foil and plastic wraps and bags while seasonal slowdowns for closures generally occurred in the fourth quarter of the year products were generally sold directly to customers consisting of supermarkets beverage companies food processors retail chains and commercial foodservice distributors

liquidity and capital resources 

alcoa takes a very disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet in 2009 management continued to face the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively due to the global economic downturn 

in response to changes in the economic markets across the globe in the second half of 2008 management initiated the following actions to conserve cash and preserve liquidity greater scrutiny over the daily management of alcoa’s cash 

  

position higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels targeted headcount reductions across the globe a global salary and hiring freeze suspension of the existing share repurchase program and the addition of a new 364day 1900 revolving credit facility expired in october 2009 a number of changes were also made to alcoa’s capital expenditures strategy as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible and all noncritical capital expenditures were stopped capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa’s compliance with the law keep a facility operating or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs the planned sale or shutdown of various businesses contributed positively to alcoa’s liquidity position in 2009 

in march 2009 alcoa announced an additional series of operational and financial actions to significantly improve the company’s cost structure and liquidity operational actions included procurement efficiencies and overhead rationalization to reduce costs and working capital initiatives to yield significant cash improvements financial actions included a reduction in the quarterly common stock dividend from 017 per share to 003 per share which began with the dividend paid on may 25 2009 and the issuance of 1725 million shares of common stock and 575 in convertible notes that collectively yielded 1438 in net proceeds 

along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa’s current operational and business needs for a discussion of longterm liquidity see contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

cash from operations 

cash from operations in 2009 was 1365 compared with 1234 in 2008 resulting in an increase of 131 or 11 the improvement of 131 is principally related to a 1639 cash inflow associated with working capital 395 in lower pension contributions and a positive change of 103 in noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities all of which was mostly offset by significantly lower earnings including the effects of noncash income and expenses and 147 in cash used for discontinued operations the components of the change in working capital were as follows a 443 decrease in receivables primarily as a result of lower sales across all businesses and heightened collection efforts a 1611 reduction in inventories mostly due to lower levels of inventory onhand in response to a significant drop in demand curtailed production at alcoa’s refineries and smelters and reduced costs for certain raw materials a 223 decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets a 653 decrease in accounts payable trade principally the result of fewer purchasing needs and declining commodity prices a 187 increase in accrued expenses mainly driven by a charge related to a recent european commission decision on electricity pricing for smelters and a decline of 172 in taxes including income taxes mostly due to the change from an operating income position to an operating loss position 

in 2010 alcoa estimates that a payment in the range of 300 to 500 will be required related to the aforementioned european commission decision additionally alcoa expects to receive a us federal income tax refund of 300 to 350 for the carryback of its 2009 net operating loss to the 2007 and 2006 tax years 

cash from operations in 2008 was 1234 compared with 3111 in 2007 resulting in a decrease of 1877 or 60 the decline of 1877 was primarily due to a decrease in earnings including the effects of noncash income and expenses a 779 cash outflow associated with working capital 201 in higher pension contributions and the absence of 93 in cash received on a longterm aluminum supply contract these cash outflows were slightly offset by 97 in cash provided from discontinued operations the components of the 779 change in working capital are as follows a 142 increase in receivables primarily as a result of improved sales from most businesses not classified as held for sale a 522 increase in inventories mostly due to higher costs of raw materials and other inputs a 37 decline in prepaid expenses and other current assets a 156 decrease in accounts payable trade a 209 decrease in accrued expenses and a 213 increase in taxes including taxes on income 

financing activities 

cash provided from financing activities was 37 in 2009 compared with cash provided from financing activities of 1478 in 2008 and cash used for financing activities of 1538 in 2007

on february 13 2009 moody’s investors service moody’s changed its longterm debt rating of alcoa from baa1 to baa3 and its shortterm debt rating from prime2 to prime3 moody’s rating report stated that the changes in alcoa’s ratings reflect the relatively weak debt protection measures increased debt levels and leverage ratios and negative cash flow position of alcoa going into a major economic downturn moody’s removed all ratings from negative creditwatch and the current outlook was changed from negative to stable the change in the outlook was based on moody’s view that alcoa will be able to materially reduce shortterm debt outstanding due to the monetization of alcoa’s investment in shining prospect the anticipation that alcoa will continue to focus on reducing cash consumption and that liquidity will remain comfortably above requirements 

on december 21 2009 moody’s changed their current outlook from stable to rating under review for both longterm and shortterm debt of alcoa moody’s review reflects alcoa’s announcement that it signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new industrial complex in saudi arabia comprised of a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill which will require the company to spend approximately 900 over a fouryear period the potential for further delay in balance sheet improvement and debt reduction as a result of this investment given moody’s expectation for only slow recovery in the aluminum industry and in alcoa’s earnings was a consideration prompting this review the review also results from the slower than anticipated by moody’s recovery in earnings generation through 2009 by alcoa despite higher than anticipated aluminum prices together with the more moderate pace of improvement in debt protection metrics debt reduction and balance sheet strength 

on february 13 2009 fitch ratings fitch changed its longterm debt rating of alcoa from bbb to bbb and its shortterm debt rating from f2 to f3 fitch’s rating report stated that the changes in alcoa’s ratings reflect lower earnings coupled with higher than expected debt levels resulting in higher financial leverage fitch also changed the current outlook from stable to negative the report further stated that the ratings reflect alcoa’s leading position in the industry its strength in lowcost alumina production and the operating flexibility afforded by the scope of the company’s operations

 obligations for operating activities 

energyrelated purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 40 years the majority of raw material and other purchase obligations have expiration 

  

dates of 24 months or less certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components and as a result actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table operating leases represent multiyear obligations for certain computer equipment plant equipment vehicles and buildings 

interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december 31 2009 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2037 the effect of outstanding interest rate swaps which are accounted for as fair value hedges are included in interest related to total debt as of december 31 2009 these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on 1890 of debt through 2018 as the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 

estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates the minimum required cash outlays for pension funding are estimated to be 100 for 2010 and 610 for 2011 see note y to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k the increase in the projected funding is the result of a reduction in available pension funding credits from 2010 to 2011 the funding estimate is 670 for 2012 620 for 2013 and 530 for 2014 the expected pension contributions in 2010 and later reflect the impacts of the pension protection act of 2006 and the worker retiree and employer recovery act of 2008 pension contributions are expected to decline beginning in 2015 if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future postretirement benefit payments are expected to approximate 300 annually net of the estimated subsidy receipts related to medicare part d and are reflected in the preceding table through 2019 alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and postretirement benefit payments beyond 2014 and 2019 respectively 

layoff and other restructuring payments primarily relate to severance costs and are expected to be paid within one year amounts scheduled to be paid beyond one year are related to ongoing site remediation work special termination benefit payments and lease termination costs 

deferred revenue arrangements require alcoa to deliver alumina over the specified contract period through 2027 while these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made 

uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december 31 2009 the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “thereafter” column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires then additional payments will not be necessary 

obligations for financing activities 

total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt including shortterm borrowings and longterm debt maturities for longterm debt extend to 2037 

alcoa has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock including dividends on preferred stock alcoa paid 228 in dividends to shareholders during 2009 because all dividends are subject to approval by alcoa’s board of directors amounts are not included in the preceding table until such authorization has occurred as of december 31 2009 there were 974378820 and 546024 shares of outstanding common stock and preferred stock respectively the annual preferred stock dividend is at the rate of 375 per share in march 2009 alcoa decreased its annual common stock dividend from 068 per share to 012 per share which began with the dividend paid on may 25 2009 as part of a series of operational and financial actions taken to significantly improve alcoa’s liquidity position 

  

obligations for investing activities 

capital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of december 31 2009 funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects it is anticipated that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources including cash provided from operations total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 1000 in 2010 

in december 2009 alcoa signed an agreement to enter into a joint venture to develop a new industrial complex in the kingdom of saudi arabia comprised of a bauxite mine alumina refinery aluminum smelter and rolling mill which will require the company to spend approximately 900 over a fouryear period 2010 through 2013 this amount is not reflected in the preceding table as estimates of amounts per year are still being determined 

payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur in connection with the 2005 acquisition of two fabricating facilities in russia alcoa could be required to make additional contingent payments of approximately 85 through 2015 but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard 

offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2009 alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of 378 these guarantees expire in 2015 through 2027 and relate to project financing for hydroelectric power projects in brazil alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to legal customs duties and leasing obligations among others which expire at various dates that total 490 at december 31 2009

alcoa had an existing program with a different thirdparty to sell certain customer receivables the sale of receivables under this program was conducted through a qualifying special purpose entity qspe that was bankruptcy remote and therefore was not consolidated by alcoa effective august 31 2008 alcoa terminated this program and all outstanding customer receivables were collected by the qspe through the end of 2008 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include accounting for derivatives and hedging activities environmental and litigation matters asset retirement obligations the testing of goodwill equity investments and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimating fair value of businesses to be divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits obligations stockbased compensation and income taxes 

  

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements in part ii item 8 of this form 10k management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

derivatives and hedging derivatives are held for purposes other than trading and are part of a formally documented risk management program for derivatives designated as fair value hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the historical high correlation of changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges alcoa measures hedge effectiveness by formally assessing at least quarterly the probable high correlation of the expected future cash flows of the hedged item and the derivative hedging instrument the ineffective portions of both types of hedges are recorded in sales or other income or expense in the current period if the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective or it becomes probable that an expected transaction will no longer occur future gains or losses on the derivative are recorded in other income or expense 

alcoa accounts for interest rate swaps related to its existing longterm debt and hedges of firm customer commitments for aluminum as fair value hedges as a result the fair values of the derivatives and changes in the fair values of the underlying hedged items are reported in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair values of these derivatives and underlying hedged items generally offset and are recorded each period in sales or interest expense consistent with the underlying hedged item 

alcoa accounts for hedges of foreign currency exposures and certain forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges the fair values of the derivatives are recorded in other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet the effective portions of the changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to sales cost of goods sold or other income or expense in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged items or in the period that the transaction no longer qualifies as a cash flow hedge these contracts cover the same periods as known or expected exposures generally not exceeding five years 

if no hedging relationship is designated the derivative is marked to market through earnings 

cash flows from derivatives are recognized in the statement of consolidated cash flows in a manner consistent with the underlying transactions 

environmental matters expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations which will not contribute to future revenues are expensed liabilities are recorded when remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated the liability may include costs such as site investigations consultant fees feasibility studies outside contractors and monitoring expenses estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery claims for recovery are recognized as agreements are reached with third parties the estimates also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that alcoa has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share the liability is periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other factors that may be relevant including changes in technology or regulations 

litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable management determines the likelihood of an 

  

unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter available defenses and case strategy progress of the matter views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors applicability and success of appeals processes and the outcome of similar historical matters among others once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable management weighs the probability of estimated losses and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded with respect to unasserted claims or assessments management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made legal matters are reviewed periodically or sooner if significant changes in matters have occurred to determine if a change in the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a loss is necessary 

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal treatment transportation storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks polychlorinated biphenyls various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2009 ranges from less than 1 to 52 per structure 131 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others it is important to note that fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has nine reporting units previously there were ten reporting units – the ees business was sold in 2009 of which five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment the remaining four reporting units are the alumina segment the primary metals segment the flatrolled products segment and the soft alloy extrusions business in brazil which is included in corporate almost 90 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs 1018 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1622 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment and primary metals 1794 these amounts include an allocation of corporate goodwill 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its 

  

reporting units when testing for impairment as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in 2009 the estimated fair values of all nine reporting units were in excess of their carrying values resulting in no impairment the impairments tests yielded similar results between 2009 and 2008 including a smaller excess for primary metals than had been the case historically in 2008 the excess of the estimated fair value of primary metals over its carrying value was substantially less than in prior years due to the unprecedented decline in the lme price that occurred in the second half of the year historically lme pricing levels and corresponding input costs eg raw materials energy have generally trended in the same manner resulting in relatively consistent cash margins over time however the decline in the lme price significantly outpaced any decreases in associated input costs causing expected cash margins in the early years in the dcf model to be lower than normal and lower than longterm expectations in 2009 the lme price increased gradually throughout the year and exceeded 2000 in whole dollars per metric ton by the end of the year resulting in higher undiscounted expected future cash flows for primary metals as the historical trend between lme pricing levels and input costs began to return however primary metals’ wacc the measure used by alcoa to discount expected future cash flows increased from 84 in 2008 to 104 in 2009 effectively negating the positive impact the rising lme price had on expected future cash flows as a result primary metals’ fair value continued to exceed its carrying value even though the excess has not yet returned to levels prior to 2008 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortiums which are accounted for on the equity method the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model the determination of what constitutes an asset group and the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows also require significant judgments 

  

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality the interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the interest rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 is approximately 340 and either a charge or credit of 16 to aftertax earnings in the following year the longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated by considering expected returns on current asset allocations which is supported by historical actual returns and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets a change in the assumption for the longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 16 for 2010 in 2009 the expected longterm rate of return was reduced to 875 due to lower future expected market returns as a result of the global economic downturn this was supported by the fact that for the first time in 20 years in 2008 the 10year moving average of actual performance fell below 9 even though the 20year moving average continued to exceed 9 in 2009 the 20year moving average of actual performance fell below 9 for the first time in more than 15 years but has continued to exceed 875 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be 875 in 2010 

in 2009 a net charge of 182 102 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate which was somewhat offset by the favorable performance of the plan assets and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs in 2008 a net charge of 2181 1374 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of plan assets which was somewhat offset by the decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation as a result of a 20 basispoint increase in the discount rate and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs additionally in both 2009 and 2008 a charge of 8 was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of new stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility annual forfeiture rate and exercise behavior these assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time 

as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant equity grants are issued in january each year as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first and second quarters of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2009 2008 and 2007 was 87 58 aftertax 94 63 aftertax and 97 63 aftertax respectively of this amount 21 19 and 19 in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

on december 31 2005 alcoa accelerated the vesting of 11 million unvested stock options granted to employees in 2004 and on january 13 2005 the 2004 and 2005 accelerated options had weighted average exercise prices of 3560 and 2954 respectively and in the aggregate represented approximately 12 of alcoa’s total outstanding options the decision to accelerate the vesting of the 2004 and 2005 options was made primarily to avoid recognizing the 

  

related compensation expense in future earnings upon the adoption of a new accounting standard the accelerated vesting of the 2004 and 2005 stock options reduced alcoa’s aftertax stock option compensation expense in 2007 by 7 

plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized

overview 

alcoa is the world leader in the production and management of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina combined through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry technology mining refining smelting fabricating and recycling aluminum is a commodity that is traded on the london metal exchange lme and priced daily based on market supply and demand aluminum and alumina represent more than threefourths of alcoa’s revenues and the price of aluminum influences the operating results of alcoa nonaluminum products include precision castings and aerospace and industrial fasteners alcoa’s products are used worldwide in aircraft automobiles commercial transportation packaging building and construction oil and gas defense and industrial applications 

alcoa is a global company operating in 35 countries based upon the country where the point of sale occurred north america and europe generated 54 and 26 respectively of alcoa’s sales in 2008 in addition alcoa has 

  

investments and activities in australia brazil china iceland guinea and russia all of which present opportunities for substantial growth governmental policies and other economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates affect the results of operations in these countries 

alcoa’s operations consist of five worldwide segments alumina primary metals flatrolled products engineered products and solutions and packaging and consumer this segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 2008 

description of the business 

information describing alcoa’s businesses can be found on the indicated pages of this report 

 

 the following charts and related discussion of the company’s bauxite interests alumina refining and primary aluminum facilities and capacities and flatrolled products engineered products and solutions and corporate facilities provide additional description of alcoa’s businesses the alumina segment primarily consists of a series of affiliated operating entities referred to as alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac alcoa owns 60 and alumina limited owns 40 of these individual entities for more information on awac see exhibit nos 10 a through 10f1 to this report 

  

bauxite interests 

aluminum is one of the most plentiful elements in the earth’s crust aluminum is produced primarily from bauxite an ore containing aluminum in the form of aluminum oxide commonly referred to as alumina aluminum is made by extracting alumina from bauxite and then removing oxygen from the alumina alcoa processes most of the bauxite that it mines into alumina the company obtains bauxite from resources held by awac from the company’s interests in the countries listed in the chart below and under both longterm and shortterm contracts and mining leases in 2008 alcoa consumed 352 million metric tons mt of bauxite from its own resources 60 million mt from related third parties and 33 million mt from unrelated third parties alcoa’s present sources of bauxite are sufficient to meet the forecasted requirements of its alumina refining operations for the foreseeable future the following table provides information regarding the company’s bauxite interests

 alumina refining facilities and capacity 

alcoa is the world’s leading producer of alumina alcoa’s alumina refining facilities and its worldwide alumina capacity are shown in the following table

in september 2005 alcoa announced that its board of directors approved plans to make further investments in the company’s brazilian “upstream” operations investments include i a 21 million mtpy expansion of the alumar consortium alumina refinery in são luís state of maranhão expected to increase the refinery’s current capacity to approximately 35 million mtpy in 2009 with alcoa’s share of the total facility output more than doubling to 189 million mtpy based on its 54 ownership stake through alumínio and awac and ii the modernization of the poços de caldas aluminum smelter in the state of minas gerais 

in november 2005 alcoa world alumina llc awa llc and rio tinto alcan inc signed a basic agreement with the government of guinea that sets forth the framework for development of a 15 million mtpy alumina refinery in guinea in 2006 the basic agreement was approved by the guinean national assembly and was promulgated into law the basic agreement was set to expire in november 2008 but has been extended to 2010 prefeasibility studies were completed in 2008 further project activities may be considered in 2009 but execution is dependent upon global economic conditions and conditions within guinea 

in september 2006 alcoa received environmental approval from the government of western australia for expansion of the wagerup alumina refinery to a maximum capacity of 47 million mtpy a potential increase of over 2 million mtpy this approval included environmental conditions that must be satisfied before alcoa can seek construction approval for the project the project was suspended in november 2008 due to global economic conditions and the unavailability of a secure long term energy supply in western australia 

in 2007 jamalco completed the early works program at its clarendon jamaica refinery which added 146000 mtpy of production increasing the total capacity to 1421 million mtpy as a result of the early works program awac’s ownership in jamalco increased to approximately 55 with the government of jamaica owning approximately 45 

in june 2008 awac and vietnam national coalminerals industries group vinacomin signed a cooperation agreement in which awac agreed to conduct due diligence on the acquisition of a 40 interest in the 600000 mtpy nhan co alumina refinery to be constructed in vietnam’s central highlands in dak nong province by a joint stock company majority owned by vinacomin separately awac and vinacomin agreed to conduct a joint feasibility study of the gia nghia bauxite mine and alumina refinery project also located in dak nong province with first stage capacity expected to be between 10 and 15 million mtpy the due diligence on the nhan co project was undertaken in 2008 and alcoa advised vinacomin that it does not intend to acquire an interest in the refinery project at this time the cooperation between awac and vinacomin on gia nghia is subject to approval by the government of vietnam if established the gia nghia venture is expected to be 51 owned by vinacomin 40 by awac and 9 by others 

as a result of the poorer industry economics and liquidity constraints during the fourth quarter of 2008 we determined the brown field expansion project in jamaica will not be completed for at least the next several years in the event the expansion of the jamaican refinery is revisited at some point in the future in all likelihood the utility of the costs incurred to date primarily relating to preliminary engineering with a finite life would be minimal as a result all previouslycapitalized costs associated with the expansion except costs associated with machinery and equipment that can be used elsewhere totaling 84 million were written off in december 2008

 as of december 31 2008 alcoa had approximately 807000 mtpy of idle capacity against total alcoa consolidated capacity of 4531000 mtpy 

alcoa and the government of iceland began detailed feasibility studies for the development of a 250000 mtpy aluminum smelter at bakki near húsavík in north iceland in 2006 the mou related to this activity was extended in 2008 separate mou agreements between alcoa and landsvirkjun and alcoa and landsnet covering development of power generation and transmission for this smelter project were signed in may 2006 although the mou between alcoa and landsvirkjun expired in 2008 the company anticipates continued negotiation and further studies on the project 

in 2007 alcoa and greenland home rule government entered into an mou regarding cooperation on a feasibility study for an aluminum smelter with a 360000 mtpy capacity in greenland the mou also encompasses a hydroelectric power system and related infrastructure improvements including a port in 2008 greenland’s parliament allocated funding to support the second phase of joint studies with alcoa and endorsed that the smelter be located at maniitsoq related studies are expected to extend through 2010 when it reconvenes in late 2009 greenland’s parliament is expected to consider greenland’s ownership position in the project 

in september 2007 alcoa in partnership with elkem aluminium ans a norwegian smelting partnership ea opened a new 280000 mtpy anode plant in mosjøen norway to supply anodes to alcoa’s fjarðaál iceland and ea’s mosjøen norway smelters historically ea was a partnership owned 50 by alcoa and 50 by orkla asa orkla through orkla’s subsidiary elkem as however in december 2008 alcoa and orkla agreed to exchange their respective stakes in ea and sapa ab a swedish extrusion joint venture sapa in order to focus on their respective areas of expertise and best practices as a result alcoa will receive orkla’s 50 stake in ea while orkla will receive alcoa’s 4545 stake in sapa ea which will be 100 owned by alcoa upon completion of the transaction operates smelters in mosjøen and lista norway with a combined output of 282000 mtpy and supplies extrusion billets rolling ingots and foundry ingots to rolling mills extrusion plants and foundries in europe included in the transaction is ea’s stake in the mosjøen anode plant in which alcoa already holds an approximate 82 stake the addition of 

  

these assets will increase alcoa’s global smelting capacity to more than 47 million mtpy the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2009 

in january 2008 alcoa and the brunei economic development board signed a memorandum of understanding mou to enable more detailed studies into the feasibility of establishing a modern gaspowered aluminum smelter in brunei darussalam the mou extends a memorandum signed originally in 2003 phase one of the feasibility study will determine scope and dimensions of the proposed facility powerdelivery strategy and location as well as an associated port and infrastructure at completion of phase one the parties will determine whether a more detailed phase two study is warranted if completed it is expected that the smelter would have an initial operating capacity of 360000 mtpy with the potential for future increase 

alcoa owns interests in the following primary aluminum facilities that are accounted for on the equity or cost basis method the capacity associated with these facilities is not included in alcoa’s consolidated capacity

energy 

alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power electric power accounts for approximately 26 of the company’s primary aluminum costs alcoa generates approximately 22 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements power generated by natural gas or in the alternative by fuel oil as purchased by the company accounts for approximately 15 and 14 respectively of the company’s total refining production costs the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters and refineries 

north america – electricity 

the deschambault baie comeau and bécancour smelters in quebec purchase electricity under longterm contracts with hydroquebec that expire in 2014 subject to extension provisions the smelter located in baie comeau quebec purchases approximately 65 of its power needs under the hydroquebec contract and receives the remainder from a 40owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power company in december 2008 new contracts with hydroquebec were signed providing each of the three smelters with an assured power supply through december 2040 provided that alcoa completes the modernization of the baie comeau smelter by the end of 2015 the modernization consists of replacing a soderberg line with a prebake line 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 23 of the power requirements for alcoa’s us smelters the company generally purchases the remainder under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates two hydroelectric projects tapoco and yadkin consisting of eight dams under federal energy regulatory commission ferc licenses apgi hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at alcoa tennessee and badin north carolina the tennessee smelter also purchases power from the tennessee valley authority under a contract that extends to 2010 

apgi received a renewed 40year ferc license for the tapoco project in 2005 the relicensing process is nearing completion for the yadkin hydroelectric project license in 2007 apgi filed with ferc a relicensing settlement agreement with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues the national environmental policy act process is complete with a final environmental impact statement having been issued in april 2008 one remaining requirement for the relicensing is the issuance by north carolina of the required water quality certification under section 401 of the clean water act the section 401 water quality certification process is ongoing after the original certification was issued and then withdrawn due to certain technical defects apgi received a yeartoyear license renewal from ferc in may 2008 and will continue to operate under that annual license until the new section 401 certification is issued and the ferc relicensing process is complete the entire process is expected to be completed during 2009 including issuance of a new project license with the badin smelter idled power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing llc and then sold into the wholesale market 

in the pacific northwest alcoa has been operating under a contract with chelan county public utility district chelan pud located in the state of washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the wenatchee smelter through october 2011 in july 2008 alcoa and chelan pud executed a new contract which will begin in november 2011 and run through october 2028 under which alcoa will receive approximately 26 of the hydropower output of chelan pud’s rocky reach and rock island dams 

alcoa has a contract through september 2011 with the bonneville power administration bpa under which alcoa was receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power purchased from the market to partially operate the intalco smelter in december 2008 the 9 th circuit court of appeals issued its opinion in the pacific northwest generating cooperative v bpa case which invalidated the financial benefits portion of that arrangement in january 2009 alcoa and bpa executed a shortterm agreement running through september 2009 that transforms that arrangement into one consistent with the court’s opinion and a further contract for the october 2009september 2011 period is expected to be agreed upon in 2009 alcoa and bpa continue to work on a longterm contract for the supply of a yetundetermined amount of power for the intalco smelter for the october 2011september 2028 period consistent with bpa’s regional public process 

  

the company through apgi generates substantially all of the power used at its warrick smelter in indiana using nearby coal reserves in may 2005 alcoa acquired mining rights to the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves and subsequently hired vigo coal company inc to manage and operate the mine the mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year 45 of the warrick power plant’s requirements the balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration in july 2005 alcoa announced its plans to invest approximately 525 million at the warrick power plant to improve environmental performance and operational efficiency as well as to lower costs this project was completed in 2008 

power for the rockdale smelter in texas was historically supplied from companyowned generating units and units owned by txu generation company lp now luminant generation company llc luminant both of which used lignite supplied by the company’s sandow mine upon completion of lignite mining in the sandow mine in 2005 lignite supply transitioned to the formerly alcoaowned three oaks mine the company retired its three whollyowned generating units at rockdale units 1 2 and 3 in late 2006 and transitioned to an arrangement under which luminant supplies all of the rockdale smelter’s electricity requirements under a longterm power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038 with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price in august 2007 luminant and alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which luminant will construct own and operate a new circulating fluidized bed power plant adjacent to the existing sandow unit four power plant and in september 2007 on the sale of the three oaks mine to luminant in june 2008 alcoa temporarily idled half of the capacity at the rockdale smelter due to electricity supply issues with luminant and in september 2008 announced the curtailment of the remainder of rockdale’s smelting capacity due to an unreliable power supply and overall market conditions 

in the northeast the purchased power contracts for both the massena east and massena west smelters in new york expire not earlier than june 30 2013 following their extension in 2003 for 10 years upon new york power authority nypa having relicensed its st lawrencefdr hydro project in december 2007 alcoa and nypa reached agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the massena east and massena west smelters for 30 years beginning on july 1 2013 the definitive agreement implementing this arrangement has been finalized approved by the nypa board and awaits signatures by nypa and the company expected in the first quarter of 2009 implementation of the massena east modernization plan is subject to further approval of the alcoa board 

the mt holly smelter in south carolina purchases electricity from santee cooper under a contract that expires december 31 2015 subject to certain extension provisions 

at the end of 2005 all production was temporarily curtailed at the eastalco smelter located in frederick maryland the curtailment coincided with the expiration of the smelter’s power contract on december 31 2005 as a competitivelypriced replacement power supply could not be obtained alcoa continues efforts to find an alternative power source for eastalco 

australia – electricity 

power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a longterm mineral lease held by aofa and that power currently provides approximately 40 of the electricity for the company’s smelter in point henry victoria the state electricity commission of victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the portland smelter under contracts with aofa that extend to 2014 and 2016 respectively 

brazil – electricity 

the alumar smelter is almost entirely supplied by eletronorte centrais elétricas do norte do brasil sa through a longterm power purchase agreement expiring in december 2024 eletronorte has supplied the alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984 alumínio’s remaining power needs for the smelter are supplied from the barra grande hydroelectric project 

  

alumínio owns a 3099 stake in maesa – machadinho energética sa which is the owner of 8306 of the machadinho hydroelectric power plant located in southern brazil alumínio’s share of the plant’s output is supplied to the poços de caldas smelter and is sufficient to cover 55 of its operating needs 

alumínio also has a 4218 interest in energética barra grande sa – baesa which built the barra grande hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil alumínio’s share of the power generated by baesa covers the remaining power needs of the poços de caldas smelter and a portion of the power needs of alumínio’s interest in the alumar smelter 

with machadinho and barra grande alumínio’s current power selfsufficiency is approximately 40 to meet a total energy demand of approximately 695 megawatts from brazilian primary plants 

alumínio is also participating in a number of other brazilian hydropower projects two of these projects have received the environmental license permits from the federal government and started construction in 2007 

 

  

 both projects are expected to begin generating power in 2010 

the pai querê project in southern brazil alumínio’s share is 35 and the santa isabel project in northern brazil alumínio’s share is 20 are still in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses 

if these projects are completed the power will be used in alumínio’s smelters or sold into the brazilian grid 

europe – electricity 

the company purchases electricity for its smelters at portovesme and fusina italy in the deregulated market under contracts expiring in december 2009 for both locations a new law went into effect on may 14 2005 that extends through december 2010 the special tariff conditions applicable to the italian smelters that measure provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the italian government however in july 2006 the european union eu opened an ongoing investigation into whether this provision should be considered unlawful state aid which may not be compatible with european legislation alcoa understands that the italian government’s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the decision of the eu commission ec on this matter it is possible that the ec could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to january 2006 a decision by the ec is not expected until late 2009 on november 29 2006 alcoa filed an appeal before the european court of first instance seeking the annulment of the decision of the ec to open the investigation alleging that such a decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules this appeal which may be withdrawn by alcoa at any time is expected to be resolved in 2009 

the company’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations that were to expire in december 2008 but which have been extended on an interim basis alcoa is currently negotiating power contracts for the supply of power to its three spanish smelters in order to provide competitive supplies of electricity after the expiry of the extended industrial tariff the finalization of which will depend on the completion of the spanish government’s regulatory package for the electricity sector on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa has been operating in spain for more than ten years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system a decision by the ec is expected in 2009 if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts 

  

iceland – electricity 

as noted above alcoa’s new fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland began operation in 2007 central to those operations is a 40year power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company built the kárahnjúkar dam and hydropower project and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter first power was supplied to the fjarðaál smelter in april 2007 and with the completion of the kárahnjúkar project in late 2007 the smelter achieved full production in april 2008 

minority interests – electricity 

the smelter in venezuela in which alcoa has only an equity stake and is not the operational manager has a variety of electricity purchase arrangements through its managing or majority partners 

pursuant to the exchange arrangement with orkla described above alcoa expects to assume 100 ownership of the two smelters in norway lista and mosjøen by the end of the first quarter of 2009 these smelters have longterm power arrangements in place which continue until at least 2019 

canada  us – natural gas 

in order to supply its refineries and smelters in the us and canada the company generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

australia – natural gas 

aofa holds a 20 equity interest in a consortium that bought the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia aofa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries gas supply from apache northwest pty ltd and a separate joint venture in which apache is a participant was curtailed beginning in june 2008 following an explosion and fire at its varanus island gas processing plant supply was progressively restored beginning in august 2008 and full supply is expected to return in early 2009 although aofa declared force majeure to its alumina customers the shortfall in gas supply from varanus island has been covered by short term contracts with other gas producers and liquid fuels production at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries was not materially impacted 

patents trade secrets and trademarks 

the company believes that its domestic and international patent trade secret and trademark assets provide it with a significant competitive advantage the company’s rights under its patents as well as the products made and sold under them are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment the patents owned by alcoa generally concern particular products or manufacturing equipment or techniques alcoa’s business as a whole is not however materially dependent on any single patent trade secret or trademark 

the company has a number of trade secrets mostly regarding manufacturing processes and material compositions that give many of its businesses important advantages in their markets the company continues to strive to improve those processes and generate new material compositions that provide additional benefits 

the company also has a number of domestic and international registered trademarks that have significant recognition within the markets that are served examples include alcoa and the alcoa symbol for aluminum products howmet metal castings huck ® fasteners kawneer building panels and durabright ® surface treatments the company’s rights under its trademarks are important to the company as a whole and to varying degrees important to each business segment 

  

competitive conditions 

alcoa is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of its aluminum and nonaluminum businesses competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets price quality and service are the principal competitive factors in alcoa’s markets where aluminum products compete with other materials – such as steel and plastics for automotive and building applications magnesium titanium composites and plastics for aerospace and defense applications steel plastics and glass for packaging applications – aluminum’s diverse characteristics particularly its light weight recyclability and flexibility are also significant factors for alcoa’s segments that market products under alcoa’s brand names brand recognition and brand loyalty also play a role 

research and development 

alcoa a technology leader in the aluminum industry engages in research and development programs that include process and product development and basic and applied research expenditures for rd activities were 246 million in 2008 238 million in 2007 and 201 million in 2006 

most of the major process areas within the company have a technology management review board tmrb consisting of members from various worldwide locations each tmrb is responsible for formulating and communicating a technology strategy for the corresponding process area developing and managing the technology portfolio and ensuring the global transfer of technology certain business units alternatively conduct these activities and research and development programs within the worldwide business unit supported by the alcoa technical center technical personnel from the tmrbs the technical center and such business units also participate in the corresponding market sector teams in this manner research and development activities are aligned with corporate and business unit goals 

during 2008 the company continued to work on new developments for a number of strategic projects in all business segments in primary metals progress was made on inert anode technology progress has been successful in many respects as a result of full pot testing of anode assemblies although there remain technical and cost targets to achieve if the technology proves to be commercially feasible the company believes that it would be able to convert its existing potlines to this new technology resulting in significant operating cost savings the new technology would also generate environmental benefits by reducing and eliminating certain emissions especially carbon dioxide no timetable has been established for commercial use progress was also made on carbothermic projects which if commercially feasible may reduce capital and energy costs as well as provide environmental benefits related to waste reduction 

in the semifabrication businesses nasa has certified alcoa’s davenport iowa facility as the only supplier in the us to produce aluminumlithium alloy 2195 thin plate for the ares 1 crew launch vehicle the rocket that will enable astronauts to explore space beyond low earth orbit with the goal of reaching the moon by 2020 

alcoa has also moved from the research and development stage to “pilot scale” on its continuous castrolled products process in addition a number of low grade scrap use technologies were developed and implemented providing both cost and environmental benefits alcoa’s first carbon capture technology plant was launched in 2008 which locks up significant amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere the kwinana australia plant has demonstrated the viability of the technology and the company is investigating options to deploy the technology throughout alcoa’s refinery system 

a number of products were commercialized in 2008 including dura bright ® wheels for automotive applications forged aluminum wheels that are 6 lighter than the traditional forged wheel unique surface sheet for the consumer electronics market the vented widemouth can – the industry’s firstever can with a builtin vent that enables consumers to enjoy a smoother pour lightweight highstrength applications for the defense market and high performance products for the oil and gas markets 

  

for the aerospace market new multimaterial technologies continue to be developed to effectively compete with composites alcoa’s advanced aerospace alloys contributed to the successful operation of china’s first homeproduced regional jet arj21700 in the automotive market alcoa also commercialized its proprietary aluminum mold alloy qc10 ®  offering an alternative to customers that produce plastic parts using steel tooling 

the company currently has at least 60 new products in various development stages as a result of product development and technological advancement the company continues to pursue patent protection in jurisdictions throughout the world 

environmental matters 

information relating to environmental matters is included in the following sections of this report under management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading “environmental matters” on pages 5557 in note a to the financial statements under the caption “environmental expenditures” on pages 8687 and in note n to the financial statements under the caption “environmental matters” on page 114 

employees 

total worldwide employment at yearend 2008 was approximately 87000 employees in 35 countries about 57000 of these employees are represented by labor unions the company believes that relations with its employees and any applicable union representatives generally are good 

in the united states approximately 12000 employees are represented by various labor unions the master collective bargaining agreement between alcoa and the united steelworkers covering 10 locations and approximately 7000 united states employees is scheduled to expire on may 31 2010 there are 20 other collective bargaining agreements in the united states with varying expiration dates various collective bargaining agreements with varying expiration dates cover about 27000 employees in europe 7000 employees in mexico 4500 employees in south america 4000 employees in australia and 2500 employees in canada 

in january 2009 alcoa announced that it expects to reduce headcount by more than 13500 worldwide employees by the end of 2009 the company also expects to eliminate 1700 contractor positions alcoa has instituted a global salary and hiring freeze 




 item 1a risk factors 

alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations may be impacted by a number of factors in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report the following are some of the important factors that could cause alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

risks relating to global economic downturn and disruptions in financial markets 

the duration or severity of the current global economic downturn and disruptions in the financial markets and their impact on alcoa are uncertain 

the aluminum industry generally is highly cyclical with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in lme prices economic conditions generally and aluminum enduse markets the recent global economic downturn coupled with the global financial and credit market disruptions have had a historic negative impact on the aluminum industry and alcoa these events have contributed to an unprecedented decline 56 in the last five months of 2008 in lmebased aluminum prices weak end markets a sharp drop in demand increased global inventories and higher costs of borrowing andor diminished credit availability while alcoa believes that the longterm prospects for aluminum remain bright the company is unable to predict the duration or severity of the current global economic and financial crisis the company has implemented or is taking a number of actions to conserve cash reduce costs and strengthen its competitiveness including curtailing production halting noncritical capital expenditures accelerating new sourcing strategies for raw 

  

materials divesting noncore assets initiating global headcount reductions suspending its existing share repurchase program and making other liquidity enhancements however there can be no assurance that these actions or any others that the company may take in response to further deterioration in economic and financial conditions will be sufficient a protracted continuation or worsening of the global economic downturn or disruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s business financial condition or results of operations 

alcoa could be materially adversely affected by further declines in aluminum prices 

the price of aluminum is frequently volatile and changes in response to general economic conditions expectations for supply and demand growth or contraction and the level of global inventories the influence of hedge funds and other financial investment funds participating in commodity markets has also increased in recent years contributing to higher levels of price volatility during recent months there has been a significant decline 56 over the second half of 2008 as well as substantial volatility in aluminum prices due at least in part to the deteriorating global economic environment at the same time there is often a lag effect for a reduction in lmelinked costs of production for example reduction of certain key smelting input costs such as alumina and power may lag declining average primary metal revenue by up to three months a sustained weak aluminum pricing environment or a further deterioration in aluminum prices could have a material adverse effect upon alcoa’s business financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

recent downgrades in alcoa’s credit ratings as well as any additional downgrades will increase alcoa’s cost of borrowing and could further adversely affect alcoa’s access to the capital markets 

alcoa’s cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short and longterm debt ratings assigned to alcoa’s debt by the major credit rating agencies these ratings are based in significant part on the company’s performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios in february 2009 standard  poor’s ratings services sp and fitch ratings fitch each lowered alcoa’s longterm debt rating to bbb sp and fitch lowered the company’s shortterm debt ratings to a3 and f3 respectively and both indicated that the current outlook is negative also in february 2009 moody’s investors service lowered alcoa’s longterm debt rating to baa3 and the company’s shortterm debt rating to prime3 and indicated that the current outlook is stable although the company has available to it committed revolving credit facilities to provide liquidity these recent downgrades in alcoa’s credit ratings as well as any additional downgrades will increase alcoa’s cost of borrowing and could have a further adverse effect on its access to the capital markets including restricting in whole or in part its access to the commercial paper market there can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of shortterm financing for the company an inability to access the capital markets could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial condition results of operations or cash flow 

alcoa could be adversely affected by the failure of financial institutions to fulfill their commitments under committed credit facilities 

as discussed in part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations – liquidity and capital resources of this report alcoa has committed revolving credit facilities with financial institutions available for its use for which the company pays commitment fees each facility is provided by a syndicate of several financial institutions with each institution agreeing severally and not jointly to make revolving credit loans to alcoa in accordance with the terms of the related credit agreement if one or more of the financial institutions providing these committed credit facilities were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment the portion of the committed facility provided by such defaulting financial institution would not be available to the company 

  

other business risks 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts the following could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials or by significant lag effects for decreases in commodity or lmelinked costs 

alcoa’s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials including energy carbon products caustic soda and other key inputs as well as freight costs associated with transporting raw materials to refining and smelting locations alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs similarly alcoa’s operating results will be affected by significant lag effects for declines in key costs of production that are commodity or lmelinked for example declines in lmelinked costs of alumina and power in a particular period may not be adequate to offset sharp declines in metal price in that period 

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its brazilian growth projects or realize expected benefits from its portfolio streamlining strategy 

as a result of the current global economic downturn and as part of the company’s initiative to conserve cash alcoa has halted all noncritical capital investment except for the completion of the são luís refinery expansion and the greenfield juruti bauxite mine in brazil which are targeted for completion in the first half of 2009 there can be no assurance that these projects will be completed within budget or by the targeted completion date or that they will be beneficial to alcoa whether due to a further deteriorating global economic environment lack of financing increases in construction costs currency fluctuations or other factors 

in addition as part of its strategy to strengthen its competitiveness alcoa has announced restructuring actions to streamline its portfolio and an agreement to exchange assets to increase alcoa’s smelter capacity while divesting itself of a business that operates in a difficult market there can be no assurance that these actions will be beneficial to alcoa that targeted completion dates will be met or that estimated proceeds from asset sales will be realized 

alcoa’s global operations are exposed to political and economic risks and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has operations or activities in numerous countries outside the us having varying degrees of political and economic risk including china guinea and russia among others risks include those associated with political instability civil unrest expropriation nationalization renegotiation or nullification of existing agreements mining leases and permits and changes in local government laws regulations and policies including those related to tariffs 

  

and trade barriers taxation exchange controls employment regulations and repatriation of earnings while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict any one or more of them could adversely affect alcoa’s business financial condition or operating results 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates and continued volatility or deterioration in the global economic and financial environment could affect alcoa’s revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the brazilian real canadian dollar euro and australian dollar may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies while products generally are sold in us dollars 

a reduction in chinese demand may negatively impact alcoa’s results 

the chinese market is a significant source of global demand for commodities a sustained slowdown in china’s economic growth whether as part of the current global economic downturn or otherwise could have an adverse effect on the global supply and demand for aluminum and aluminum prices in addition china’s investments to increase its selfsufficiency in key commodities may impact future demand and supply balances and prices 

alcoa faces significant competition 

as discussed in part i item 1 business – competitive conditions of this report the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive alcoa’s competitors include a variety of both us and nonus companies in all major markets in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

further metals industry consolidation could impact alcoa’s business 

the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted alcoa’s business further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn or further deterioration in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa as a result of the current global economic and financial crisis or otherwise could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products labor strikes diminished liquidity or credit unavailability weak demand for their products or other difficulties in their businesses if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in law 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa the company is subject to a variety of legal compliance risks these risks include among other things potential claims 

  

relating to product liability health and safety environmental matters intellectual property rights government contracts taxes and compliance with us and foreign export laws competition laws and sales and trading practices alcoa could be subject to fines penalties damages in certain cases treble damages or suspension or debarment from government contracts while alcoa believes it has adopted appropriate risk management and compliance programs to address and reduce these risks the global and diverse nature of its operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and contingencies may arise from time to time alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period may be affected by the outcome of legal proceedings changes in law or other contingencies that it cannot predict with certainty 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of health safety and environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent health safety and environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain health safety or environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to several sites additionally evolving regulatory standards and expectations can result in increased litigation andor increased costs all of which can have a material and adverse effect on earnings and cash flows 

climate change climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact alcoa’s operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that energy consumption is a contributor to global warming greenhouse effects and potentially climate change 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia or potential carbon trading regimes that will affect energy prices alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 

alcoa’s estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality alcoa’s results of operations liquidity or shareholders’ equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions 

  

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

some of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to its business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on alcoa’s financial results 

alcoa may not realize expected benefits from its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance and conserve cash including new procurement strategies for raw materials such as backward integration and nontraditional sourcing from numerous geographies and deployment of companywide business process models such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode and carbothermic technology in addition to multialloy casting processes there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance further existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events 

the above list of important factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

environmental matters

sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report was between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes because the selection of the 2 million alternative natural recovery was considered remote the company adjusted the reserve for the grasse river in 2002 to 30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives as no single alternative could be identified as more probable than the others in june 2003 based on then recent river observations epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered the results of these additional studies submitted in a report to epa in april 2004 suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios those evaluations were submitted to epa along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river in may 2004 epa approved alcoa’s proposed remedial options pilot study rops that includes sediment removal and capping the installation of an ice control structure and significant monitoring at the same time alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the 35 million estimated cost of the rops in addition to the 30 million previously reserved most of the construction work for the rops was completed in 2005 with monitoring through 2008 the reserves for the grasse river were reevaluated in the fourth quarter of 2006 and an adjustment of 4 million was made this adjustment covered commitments made to the epa for additional investigation work for the ongoing monitoring program including that associated with the rops program to prepare a revised analysis of alternatives report and for an interim measure that involves annually the mechanical ice breaking of the river to prevent the formation of ice jams until a permanent remedy is selected epa has since eliminated the ice breaking requirement the findings from the rops program and from these additional investigations were incorporated into a revised analysis of alternatives report that was submitted to epa in 2008 this update incorporated new information obtained from the rops regarding the feasibility and costs associated with various capping and dredging alternatives and incorporated various options for ice control epa will use this information to develop a remedy for the river alcoa adjusted the reserve in the fourth quarter of 2008 by an additional 40 million for increases associated with updated cost for a proposed remedy incorporating ice control and for partial settlement of potential resource damages the epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the epa’s record of decision is issued which is expected in 2009 or later

other matters

as previously reported on july 20 2006 the european commission ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff granted by italy to some energy intensive industries complies with european union eu state aid rules the new italian power tariff modifies the preferential tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 and extends it through 2010 alcoa has been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure like the new one was based on italian state legislation that provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the italian government the ec’s announcement states that it has doubts about the measure’s compatibility with eu legislation and concerns about distortion of competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs the opening of an indepth investigation gives interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed measures it does not prejudge the outcome of the procedure it is alcoa’s understanding that the italian government’s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations alcoa believes that the total potential impact from a loss of the tariff would be approximately 21 million or €15 million pretax per month in higher power costs at its italian smelters the estimated total potential impact has increased since 2006 due predominantly to the weakening of the us dollar as the liability would be payable in euros in the event of a negative outcome while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the ec’s decision on this matter it is possible that the ec could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to january 2006 if the ec’s investigation concludes that extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff is unlawful alcoa will follow through with the appeal it filed before the court of first instance in luxembourg in november of 2006 in response to the investigation

benefits and attorneys’ fees alcoa has consented to treatment of plaintiffs’ claims as a class action during the fourth quarter of 2007 following briefing and argument the court ordered consolidation of the plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction with trial certified a plaintiff class bifurcated and stayed the plaintiffs’ breach of fiduciary duty claims struck the plaintiffs’ jury demand but indicated it would use an advisory jury and initially set a trial date of september 17 2008 in august 2008 the court set a new trial date of march 24 2009 and in january 2009 moved it to september 22 2009 alcoa estimates that in the event of an unfavorable outcome the maximum exposure would be an additional postretirement benefit liability of approximately 300 million and approximately 40 million of expense includes an interest cost component annually on average for the next 11 years alcoa believes that it has valid defenses and intends to defend this matter vigorously however at this stage of the proceeding the company is unable to reasonably predict the outcome 

as previously reported on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa has been operating in spain for more than 9 years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies the investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the ec with respect to the energyintensive consumers the ec is opening the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than the pool price mechanism therefore being in principle artificially below market conditions alcoa has submitted comments in which the company has provided evidence that prices paid by energyintensive consumers were in line with the market in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system therefore it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005 it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years alcoa believes that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision would be approximately 11 million or €8 million pretax for 2005 if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts

in 2008 the company was faced with numerous challenges including significantly higher costs for raw materials energy and other input costs and the continued depreciation of the us dollar against the brazilian real during the second half of 2008 global economic markets began an unprecedented decline which resulted in a historic drop in the lme cash price per metric ton in response to such extraordinary market conditions management made the decision to reduce alcoa’s aluminum and alumina production by 750 kmt and 1500 kmt respectively management also initiated the following actions to secure cash and safeguard alcoa’s liquidity halted all noncritical capital expenditures suspended the existing share repurchase program added a new 364day revolving credit facility initiated global headcount reductions instituted a global salary and hiring freeze and decided to sell the electrical and electronic solutions global foil and transportation products europe businesses and to close the lone remaining auto cast wheels facility additionally alcoa agreed to exchange its stake in the sapa ab joint venture for orkla asa’s stake in the elkem aluminium ans joint venture this transaction will provide alcoa with increased smelting capacity by gaining full control of two smelters with competitive hydropower contracts while divesting itself of a business that management determined to exit in 2007 

while global demand for aluminum is expected to continue to decline in 2009 the actions that were initiated near the end of 2008 will allow alcoa to emerge even stronger when the global economy recovers in 2009 management will work toward the following goals 

 

  

  

 results of operations 

earnings summary 

alcoa’s income from continuing operations for 2008 was 229 or 028 per diluted share compared with 2814 or 323 per share in 2007 the decrease in income from continuing operations was mostly due to the following the absence of the gain related to the sale of alcoa’s investment in aluminum corporation of china limited chalco significantly higher charges for the 2008 restructuring program continued increases in raw materials energy and other inputs increased net unfavorable foreign currency movements the absence of all of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment for 10 months and costs associated with a gas outage in western australia and a complete smelter curtailment in rockdale tx 

these negative impacts were slightly offset by the absence of certain costs associated with the rockdale tennessee and iceland smelters and the absence of transaction costs and interest charges related to a potential business combination all of which occurred in 2007 

net loss for 2008 was 74 or 009 per diluted share compared with net income of 2564 or 295 per share in 2007 in 2008 the net loss of 74 included a loss from discontinued operations of 303 all related to the electrical and electronic solutions ees business 

alcoa’s income from continuing operations for 2007 was 2814 or 323 per diluted share compared with 2226 or 254 per share in 2006 the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the following higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum strong demand in the downstream businesses serving the aerospace and packaging markets a gain on the sale of the investment in chalco a favorable adjustment related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business a decrease in the charge recorded for lastin firstout lifo inventory reserves a nonrecurring foreign currency gain in russia and the absence of labor contract and strike preparation costs recognized in 2006 

these positive impacts were mostly offset by the following items significant increases in energy raw materials and other input costs net unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker us dollar asset 

  

impairments and restructuring charges associated with the packaging and consumer businesses and the automotive castings business as well as a discrete income tax charge related to the packaging and consumer businesses smelter curtailment costs associated with the power outage in tennessee and the shutdown of one of the potlines in rockdale startup costs at the iceland smelter costs associated with the national labor strike in guinea the repairs of the refinery in jamaica and the restart of one of intalco’s smelter lines transaction costs and interest charges associated with a potential business acquisition stockbased compensation expense for reloaded options and the absence of a favorable legal settlement that occurred in 2006 related to a former reynolds distribution business 

net income for 2007 was 2564 or 295 per diluted share compared with 2248 or 257 per share in 2006 in 2007 net income of 2564 included a loss from discontinued operations of 250 comprised of a 243 loss related to the ees business an 11 loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the 2006 sale of the home exteriors business and net operating income of 4 of other discontinued businesses 

in june 2008 a major gas supplier to alcoa’s western australia refining operations part of alcoa of australia suffered a pipeline rupture and fire which resulted in a complete shutdown of the supplier’s gas production operations at a certain hub and a declaration of force majeure by the supplier to all customers the disruption in gas supply caused an immediate reduction in alcoa’s production capacity and required the purchase of alternative fuel at a much higher cost than the natural gas displaced resulting in a significant negative impact on operations as a result shortly thereafter alcoa of australia notified its own customers that it was declaring force majeure under its alumina supply contracts during the second half of 2008 the supplier partially restored the gas supply to alcoa of australia full restoration is expected in the first half of 2009 in addition insurance recoveries of 52 were received in the second half of 2008 net of insurance benefits alcoa’s earnings impact of the disruption in gas supply was 49 aftertax and minority interest 102 before tax and minority interest in 2008 the alumina segment was impacted by 33 aftertax 47 before tax and the remaining impact of 29 aftertax 55 before tax was reflected in corporate due to alcoa’s captive insurance program alcoa of australia is part of alcoa world alumina and chemicals awac which is 60 owned by alcoa and 40 owned by alumina limited 

also in june 2008 alcoa temporarily idled half of the aluminum production three of six operating potlines or 120 kmt at its rockdale smelter due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale’s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues in september 2008 alcoa announced it was temporarily idling the remaining three potlines or 147 kmt as a result of the cumulative effect of operating only half of the smelter wellknown issues regarding the cost and longterm reliability of the power supply and overall market conditions in 2008 the earnings impact of the idled potlines was 55 90 pretax alcoa is seeking damages and other relief from its power supplier through ongoing litigation additionally in conjunction with the idling of all six potlines alcoa recorded restructuring charges in 2008 of 31 48 pretax mostly for the layoff of approximately 870 employees see restructuring and other charges below for additional information 

late in 2008 management made the decision to reduce alcoa’s alumina and aluminum production in response to the significant economic downturn as a result of this decision including the already completed production curtailment at the rockdale smelter reductions of 750 kmt or 18 of annualized output of alcoa’s global smelting system were implemented smelters located in the united states tennessee indiana and washington and canada will be partially or fully curtailed also alumina production will be reduced accordingly by a total of 1500 kmt across the global refining system including a partial curtailment at the point comfort tx refinery the alumina and aluminum production curtailments will be fully implemented by the end of the first quarter of 2009 

sales— sales for 2008 were 26901 compared with sales of 29280 in 2007 a decline of 2379 or 8 the decrease was driven mainly by the absence of 10 months of sales 2781 from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment the absence of sales from the soft alloy extrusion business 1115 in 2007 and volume declines for most downstream businesses especially related to the automotive and commercial transportation markets in north america and europe these negative impacts were principally offset by significantly higher primary aluminum volumes mostly as a result of sales related to the production of the iceland smelter for a full year and favorable foreign currency movements primarily due to a stronger euro and australian dollar 

  

sales for 2007 were 29280 compared with sales of 28950 in 2006 an increase of 330 or 1 the increase was primarily due to higher realized prices for alumina and aluminum of 7 and 4 respectively an increase in primary aluminum volume higher demand in the aerospace and packaging markets and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro these positive contributions were mostly offset by the absence of seven months of sales associated with the soft alloy extrusion business 

cost of goods sold— cogs as a percentage of sales was 824 in 2008 compared with 779 in 2007 the increase in the percentage was mainly the result of continued cost increases in raw materials energy and other inputs unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a significantly weaker us dollar the production at the iceland smelter that did not occur in 2007 and the impacts of the gas outage in western australia and the 2008 smelter curtailment at rockdale these items were primarily offset by the absence of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment for 10 months 840 the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business 971 in 2007 productivity improvements in most of the businesses within the engineered products and solutions segment and the absence of certain costs incurred in 2007 as a result of production curtailments associated with the tennessee and rockdale smelters and startup costs at the iceland smelter among others 

cogs as a percentage of sales was 779 in 2007 compared with 758 in 2006 the percentage increase was negatively impacted by significant increases in energy raw materials and other input costs as a result of global inflation and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar other items that contributed to the higher percentage include smelter curtailment costs associated with the power outage in tennessee and the shutdown of one of the potlines in rockdale repair costs at the jamaica refinery due to the damage caused by hurricane dean startup costs at the iceland smelter costs associated with the national labor strike in guinea restart costs for one of intalco’s smelter lines and the absence of a 2006 favorable legal settlement related to a former reynolds distribution business all of these items were partially offset by the absence of the soft alloy extrusion business the increase in sales a decrease in the charge recorded for lifo inventory reserves and the absence of labor contract and strike preparation costs that occurred in 2006 

selling general administrative and other expenses— sga expenses were 1167 or 43 of sales in 2008 compared with 1444 or 49 of sales in 2007 expenses decreased by 277 mostly due to the absence of 10 months of expenses 180 from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment the absence of transaction costs related to the 2007 offer for alcan inc 46 and the absence of expenses from the soft alloy extrusion business 33 in 2007 

sga expenses were 1444 or 49 of sales in 2007 compared with 1372 or 47 of sales in 2006 expenses increased by 72 primarily due to 46 in transaction costs investment banking legal auditrelated and other thirdparty expenses related to the offer for alcan inc an increase in stockbased compensation expense as a result of reload features of exercised stock options and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar partially offsetting these increases was the absence of seven months of expenses related to the soft alloy extrusion business 

research and development expenses— rd expenses were 246 in 2008 compared with 238 in 2007 and 201 in 2006 the increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 was driven mainly by expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the flatrolled products segment and the primary metals segment partially offset by the absence of 10 months of expenditures 16 from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment the increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 was primarily due to expenditures related to various projects for the businesses within the flatrolled products segment and the primary metals segment 

provision for depreciation depletion and amortization— the provision for dda was 1234 in 2008 compared with 1244 in 2007 the decline of 10 or 1 was principally the result of the absence of nine months of depreciation from the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment 89 in 2007 and the extension of depreciable lives for the majority of refining and smelting locations and various rolled products and hard alloy extrusions locations based upon a review of estimated useful lives completed during 2008 61 offsetting these 

  

reductions was a significant increase 83 in depreciation expense related to the iceland smelter and norway anode facility being in service for a full year and unfavorable foreign currency movements as a result of a weaker us dollar 

the provision for dda was 1244 in 2007 compared with 1252 in 2006 the decrease of 8 or 1 was primarily due to the cessation of depreciation beginning in november 2006 related to the soft alloy extrusion business and beginning in october 2007 associated with the businesses in the packaging and consumer segment all of which was the result of the classification of these businesses as held for sale these decreases were mostly offset by an increase in depreciation related to placing growth projects into service such as the pinjarra australia refinery expansion and the jamaica early works program that were both placed in service during 2006 and the startup of operations related to the iceland smelter and the mosjøen anode facility during 2007 

restructuring and other charges— restructuring and other charges for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 were comprised of the following 

 

  

 employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved detailed action plans submitted by the operating locations that specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plans 

2008 restructuring program— late in 2008 alcoa took specific actions to reduce costs and strengthen its portfolio partly due to the current economic downturn such actions include targeted reductions curtailments and plant closures and consolidations which will reduce headcount by approximately 5400 by the end of 2009 resulting in severance charges of 138 98 aftertax and minority interests asset impairments of 156 88 aftertax and minority interests and other exit costs of 58 57 aftertax the significant components of these actions were as follows 

– as a result of recent market conditions the primary metals segment will reduce production by 483 kmt and the alumina segment will reduce production by a total of 1500 kmt all of which will be fully implemented by the end of the first quarter of 2009 these production curtailments as well as targeted reductions will result in the elimination of approximately 1110 positions totaling 23 in severance costs asset impairments of 116 related to these two segments were also recognized including the write off of 84 in engineering costs related to a 1500 kmt planned expansion of jamalco’s clarendon jamaica refinery 

– the flatrolled products segment was restructured through the following actions 

 

  

  

  

   

– the engineered products and solutions segment was restructured through the following actions 

 

  

  

  

 – in order to reduce overhead serving various businesses approximately 130 positions will be eliminated at corporate resulting in severance charges of 14 and other exit costs of 3 

in addition to the above actions alcoa intends to sell its global foil and transportation products europe businesses in order to streamline its portfolio as a result of this decision the assets and related liabilities of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses were classified as held for sale asset impairments of 129 100 aftertax and 52 49 aftertax were recognized to reflect the estimated fair values of the global foil and transportation products europe businesses respectively also alcoa and orkla agreed to exchange their stakes in the sapa ab and elkem aluminium ans joint ventures this portfolio action resulted in an impairment charge of 333 223 aftertax to reflect the estimated fair value of alcoa’s investment in sapa ab 

earlier in 2008 alcoa recorded 48 31 aftertax in charges which consists of 44 29 aftertax for the layoff of approximately 870 employees and related curtailment of postretirement benefits and 4 2 aftertax for other exit costs associated with the complete production curtailment of the rockdale tx smelter 267 kmt due to ongoing power supply issues with rockdale’s onsite supplier and the uneconomical power that alcoa was forced to purchase in the open market as a result of such issues also during 2008 alcoa recorded a loss of 43 32 aftertax on the sale of its packaging and consumer businesses the remaining net charges in 2008 were comprised of 1 1 aftertax and minority interests for severance related to a reduction in headcount of approximately 30 4 for other exit costs 6 aftertax and 23 15 aftertax and minority interests for reversals of previously recorded costs slightly more than half of which related to the reversal of a reserve related to a shutdown facility 

as of december 31 2008 approximately 1000 of the 6300 employees were terminated cash payments of 7 were made against the 2008 program reserves in 2008 as a result of the implementation of this restructuring plan alcoa expects to eliminate approximately 330 pretax on an annual basis from its cost base once the program has been completed 

2007 restructuring program— in 2007 alcoa recorded restructuring and other charges of 268 201 aftertax and minority interests which were comprised of the following components 257 174 aftertax in asset impairments associated with a strategic review of certain businesses a 62 23 aftertax reduction to the original impairment charge recorded in 2006 related to the estimated fair value of the soft alloy extrusion business which was contributed to a joint venture effective june 1 2007 see the 2006 restructuring program for additional information and 73 50 aftertax and minority interests in net charges comprised of severance charges of 35 26 aftertax and minority interests related to the elimination of approximately 400 positions and asset impairments of 19 12 aftertax of various other businesses and facilities other exit costs of 47 31 aftertax and minority interests primarily for accelerated depreciation associated with the shutdown of certain facilities in 2007 related to the 2006 restructuring program and reversals of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs of 28 19 aftertax and minority interests due to normal attrition and changes in facts and circumstances 

in april 2007 alcoa announced it was exploring strategic alternatives for the potential disposition of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment and the automotive castings business in september 2007 management completed its review of strategic alternatives and determined that the best course of action was to sell the packaging 

  

and consumer and automotive castings businesses as a result of this decision the assets and related liabilities of the packaging and consumer and automotive castings businesses were classified as held for sale in the third quarter of 2007 alcoa recorded impairment charges of 215 140 aftertax related to the packaging and consumer businesses and 68 51 aftertax for the automotive castings business to reflect the writedown of the carrying value of the assets of these businesses to their respective estimated fair values in addition alcoa recorded a 464 discrete income tax charge related to goodwill associated with the planned sale of the packaging and consumer businesses that would have been nondeductible for tax purposes under the transaction structure contemplated at the time in november 2007 alcoa completed the sale of the automotive castings business and recognized a loss of 4 2 aftertax in restructuring and other charges on the statement of consolidated operations in december 2007 alcoa agreed to sell the packaging and consumer businesses for 2700 in cash and reduced the impairment charge by 26 17 aftertax and the discrete income tax charge by 322 as a result of the structure of the agreed upon sale this sale was completed in 2008 

as of december 31 2008 the terminations associated with the 2007 restructuring program were essentially complete cash payments of 20 and 13 were made against the 2007 program reserves in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

2006 restructuring program— in november 2006 alcoa executed a plan to reposition several of its downstream operations in order to further improve returns and profitability and to enhance productivity and efficiencies through a targeted restructuring of operations and the creation of a soft alloy extrusion joint venture the restructuring program encompassed identifying assets to be disposed of plant closings and consolidations that led to the elimination of approximately 1800 positions across the company’s global businesses restructuring charges of 507 347 aftertax and minority interests were recorded in 2006 and were comprised of the following components 71 of charges for employee termination and severance costs spread globally across the company 442 related to asset impairments for structures machinery equipment and goodwill more than half of which relates to the soft alloy extrusion business and 35 for other exit costs consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation associated with assets for which the useful life has been changed due to plans to close certain facilities in the near term and environmental cleanup costs partially offsetting these charges was 41 of income related to the reversal of previously recorded layoff and other exit costs resulting from new facts and circumstances that arose subsequent to the original estimates 

the significant components of the 2006 restructuring program were as follows 

– the hard and soft alloy extrusion businesses included within the former extruded and end products segment were restructured through the following actions 

 

  

 – operations within the flatrolled products segment were affected by the following actions 

 

  

   

 – reduction within the primary metals and alumina segments’ operations by approximately 330 positions to further strengthen the company’s position on the global cost curve this action resulted in charges of 44 consisting of 24 for asset impairments 14 for severance costs and 6 for other exit costs 

– consolidation of selected operations within the packaging and consumer segment resulting in the elimination of approximately 440 positions and charges of 19 consisting of 10 related to severance costs and 9 for other exit costs consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation 

– restructuring at various other locations accounted for the remaining charges of 35 more than half of which are for severance costs related to approximately 400 layoffs and the remainder for asset impairments and other exit costs 

as of december 31 2008 the terminations associated with the 2006 restructuring program were essentially complete cash payments of 9 and 37 were made against the 2006 program reserves in 2008 and 2007 respectively 

alcoa does not include restructuring and other charges in the segment results the pretax impact of allocating restructuring and other charges to the segment results would have been as follows 

 

 interest expense— interest expense was 407 in 2008 compared with 401 in 2007 resulting in an increase of 6 or 1 the increase was principally caused by a 22 higher average debt level mostly due to the issuance of 1500 in new senior notes in july 2008 and significantly higher commercial paper levels and a decrease in capitalized interest 32 primarily due to placing growth projects into service such as the iceland smelter and the norway anode facility in 2007 these items were almost completely offset by the absence of credit facility commitment fees related to the 2007 offer for alcan inc 67 and a lower weightedaverage effective interest rate driven mainly by the decrease in libor rates 

interest expense was 401 in 2007 compared with 384 in 2006 resulting in an increase of 17 or 4 the increase was primarily due to the amortization of 30 in commitment fees paid and capitalized in june 2007 and an expense of 37 for additional commitment fees paid in july 2007 both of which were paid to secure an 18month 30000 senior unsecured credit facility associated with the offer for alcan inc and a higher average debt level partially offset by an increase in the amount of interest capitalized related to construction projects including the iceland smelter the juruti bauxite mine and são luís refinery expansion in brazil and the mosjøen anode facility 

other income net— other income net was 59 in 2008 compared with 1920 in 2007 the decrease of 1861 or 97 was mostly due to the absence of the 1754 gain related to the sale of alcoa’s investment in chalco other items impacting this decline were losses related to the cash surrender value of life insurance as a result of the deterioration of the investment markets unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar the absence of dividend income from alcoa’s former stake in chalco and the absence of a nonrecurring foreign currency gain in russia all of which was partially offset by marktomarket gains on derivative contracts and income related to a negotiated partial refund of an indemnification payment previously made to the buyer of a prior alcoa divestiture 39 

  

other income net was 1920 in 2007 compared with 236 in 2006 the increase of 1684 was primarily due to the sale of alcoa’s investment in chalco which resulted in a gain of 1754 net of transaction fees and other expenses and a nonrecurring foreign currency gain in russia slightly offset by a decrease in the amount of dividends received from chalco between periods and the absence of interest related to a brazilian court settlement in 2006 

income taxes— alcoa’s effective tax rate was 432 in 2008 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 and alcoa’s effective tax rate of 338 in 2007 the effective tax rate in 2008 differs from the us federal statutory rate principally due to the following income tax charges 73 for the asset impairments included in the 2008 restructuring program 28 due to a decrease in deferred tax assets of the iceland operations as a result of an applicable tax rate change a net 19 associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses mainly due to the allocation of sale proceeds to higher tax rate jurisdictions as opposed to the allocation previously contemplated somewhat offset by changes in tax assumptions surrounding transaction costs and the finalization of the divestiture of certain foreign locations these charges were partially offset by foreign income taxed in lower rate jurisdictions and a 20 discrete income tax benefit related to the filing of the 2007 us income tax return 

alcoa’s effective tax rate was 338 in 2007 compared with the us federal statutory rate of 35 and alcoa’s effective tax rate of 243 in 2006 the effective tax rate in 2007 differs from the us federal statutory rate of 35 primarily due to lower taxes on foreign income mostly offset by a discrete income tax charge of 142 related to goodwill that is nondeductible for tax purposes associated with the sale of the packaging and consumer businesses 

management anticipates that the effective tax rate in 2009 will be approximately 30 however changes in the current economic environment currency fluctuations and the results of operations in certain taxing jurisdictions may cause this estimated rate to fluctuate significantly 

minority interests— minority interests’ share of income from continuing operations was 221 in 2008 compared with 365 in 2007 the decline of 144 was mostly due to lower earnings at awac attributed primarily to significant cost increases for raw materials and energy unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar and the impact of the gas outage in western australia 

minority interests’ share of income from continuing operations was 365 in 2007 compared with 436 in 2006 the 71 decrease was principally due to lower earnings at awac driven mainly by unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar and a significant increase in energy costs 

loss income from discontinued operations— loss from discontinued operations was 303 in 2008 compared with a loss of 250 in 2007 and income of 22 in 2006 the loss of 303 in 2008 is all related to the ees business comprised of asset impairments of 162 to reflect the estimated fair value of the business and a net operating loss of 141 which includes restructuring charges of 39 for headcount reductions of approximately 6200 and a charge of 16 for obsolete inventory the loss of 250 in 2007 consisted of a 243 loss related to the ees business including severance charges of 36 for headcount reductions of approximately 5900 as part of a strategic business review to restructure ees and impairment charges of 93 for goodwill and 60 for various fixed assets as the forecasted future earnings and cash flows of the ees business no longer supported the carrying values of such assets an 11 loss related to working capital and other adjustments associated with the 2006 sale of the home exteriors business and net operating income of 4 of other discontinued businesses the income of 22 in 2006 was comprised of a 110 gain related to the sale of the home exteriors business a 65 operating loss related to the ees business including severance charges of 30 for headcount reductions of approximately 4800 net operating losses of 20 of other discontinued businesses and a loss of 3 related to the 2005 sale of the imaging and graphics communications business see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

late in 2008 alcoa reclassified its ees business to discontinued operations based on the decision to sell the business the consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented were reclassified to reflect the ees business in discontinued operations the ees business designs and manufactures electrical and electronic systems wire harnesses and components for the ground transportation industry worldwide in 2008 the ees business generated sales of 1218 

  

and had approximately 19000 employees as of december 31 2008 during 2006 alcoa reclassified its home exteriors business to discontinued operations upon the signing of a definitive sale agreement with ply gem industries inc the sale of the home exteriors business was completed in october 2006 also during 2006 alcoa reclassified the hawesville ky automotive casting facility to discontinued operations upon closure of the facility the results of the engineered products and solutions segment were reclassified to reflect the movement of ees the home exteriors business and the hawesville automotive casting facility into discontinued operations 

segment information 

in 2008 management approved a realignment of alcoa’s reportable segments to better reflect the core businesses in which alcoa operates and how it is managed this realignment consisted of eliminating the extruded and end products segment and realigning its component businesses as follows the building and construction systems business is reported in the engineered products and solutions segment the hard alloy extrusions business and the russian extrusions business are reported in the flatrolled products segment and the remaining segment components consisting primarily of the equity investmentincome of alcoa’s interest in the sapa ab joint venture and the latin american extrusions business are reported in corporate additionally the russian forgings business was moved from the engineered products and solutions segment to the flatrolled products segment where all russian operations are now reported prior period amounts were reclassified to reflect the new segment structure also the engineered solutions segment was renamed the engineered products and solutions segment 

alcoa’s operations consist of five worldwide segments alumina primary metals flatrolled products engineered products and solutions and packaging and consumer this segment no longer contains any operations as the businesses within this segment were divested during 2008 segment performance under alcoa’s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors however the primary measure of performance is the aftertax operating income atoi of each segment certain items such as the impact of lifo inventory accounting interest income and expense minority interests corporate expense general administrative and selling expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities along with depreciation and amortization on corporateowned assets restructuring and other charges discontinued operations and other items including intersegment profit and other metal adjustments differences between tax rates used in the segments and the corporate effective tax rate and other nonoperating items such as foreign currency translation gainslosses are excluded from segment atoi segment assets exclude among others cash and cash equivalents deferred income taxes goodwill allocated to corporate corporate fixed assets lifo reserves and assets held for sale 

atoi for all segments totaled 2199 in 2008 3162 in 2007 and 3505 in 2006 see note q to the consolidated financial statements for additional information the following discussion provides shipments sales and atoi data of each segment and production data for the alumina and primary metals segments for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2008 

alumina 

 

 this segment consists of alcoa’s worldwide alumina system including the mining of bauxite which is then refined into alumina alumina is sold directly to internal and external smelter customers worldwide or is processed into industrial chemical products slightly more than half of alcoa’s alumina production is sold under supply contracts to third parties worldwide while the remainder is used internally 

  

in 2008 alumina production increased by 172 kmt compared to 2007 three of alcoa’s nine refineries achieved production records in 2008 with the largest increase occurring at the pinjarra australia refinery due to the continued positive effects of the efficiency upgrade expansion completed in 2006 late in 2008 alcoa reduced production at its point comfort tx refinery by 550 kmt per year due to negative market conditions however production for the year slightly exceeded the refinery’s 2007 production performance in 2007 alumina production decreased by 44 kmt compared to 2006 impacts from the national labor strike in guinea and hurricane dean weighed on production with 8 and 14 decreases at point comfort tx and jamaica respectively offsetting a 4 increase at pinjarra paranam suriname são luís wagerup australia and pinjarra set production records in 2007 

thirdparty sales for the alumina segment rose 8 in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily related to favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger australian dollar and increases of 3 and 2 in thirdparty shipments and realized prices respectively thirdparty sales for this segment decreased 3 in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to a 7 reduction in thirdparty shipments more than offsetting an lmedriven increase in realized prices 

intersegment sales for the alumina segment climbed 15 in 2008 compared with 2007 and 14 in 2007 compared with 2006 mainly as a result of a 6 and 7 increase in volumes respectively and higher realized prices 

atoi for the alumina segment decreased 24 in 2008 compared with 2007 mostly due to significant cost increases for bauxite caustic soda fuel oil and natural gas unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar and the impact of the gas outage in western australia 33 net of insurance benefits all of which was partially offset by higher realized prices productivity improvements and a positive impact due to the curtailment of production at the point comfort refinery atoi for this segment declined 9 in 2007 compared with 2006 principally due to unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar significantly higher energy costs and rising freight cost all of which more than offset increases in realized prices 

in 2009 alcoa will continue to focus on completing the expansion of the são luís refinery total additional alumina production of 2100 kmt alcoa’s share is 1134 kmt and the development of the juruti bauxite mine total additional 2600 kmt of bauxite alcoa’s share is 1560 kmt by the end of the first half also in response to negative market conditions alcoa plans to reduce production by another 1000 kmt per year by the end of the 2009 first quarter 1500 kmt including the previously mentioned curtailment at point comfort additionally fuel oil costs are expected to decrease while realized prices may decline significantly based on the lme’s current prices and shortterm outlook 

primary metals 

 

 this segment consists of alcoa’s worldwide smelter system primary metals receives alumina primarily from the alumina segment and produces primary aluminum used by alcoa’s fabricating businesses as well as sold to external customers aluminum traders and commodity markets results from the sale of aluminum powder scrap and excess power are also included in this segment as well as the results of aluminum derivative contracts primary aluminum produced by alcoa and used internally is transferred to other segments at prevailing market prices the sale of primary aluminum represents more than 90 of this segment’s thirdparty sales 

in 2008 aluminum production increased by 314 kmt mostly due to the iceland smelter as 2008 was its first full year of production the intalco wa smelter as a result of the restart of additional pots early in the year and the tennessee smelter all of which was slightly offset by a reduction at the rockdale tx smelter due to alcoa’s decision to curtail 

  

all production at this facility until competitive market conditions return 267 kmt per year late in 2008 alcoa started partial production curtailments at various smelters including intalco and baie comeau quebec which will result in an additional decline of 350 kmt per year in 2007 aluminum production rose 141 kmt due to the intalco smelter’s completed restart of one potline in the second quarter of 2007 the acquisition of the minority interests in the intalco smelter in june 2006 and the iceland smelter’s startup in the second quarter of 2007 

thirdparty sales for the primary metals segment climbed 22 in 2008 compared with 2007 mostly due to higher volumes primarily the result of the sales related to the production from the iceland smelter shipments made to the packaging and consumer businesses subsequent to their divestiture in 2008 and shipments made in the first half of 2008 to the sapa ab joint venture shipments to alcoa’s soft alloy extrusion business were included in intersegment sales in the first half of 2007 somewhat offset by lower realized prices of 3 thirdparty sales for this segment increased 7 in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to an increase in realized prices of 4 and improved volumes mainly due to shipments made in 2007 to the sapa ab joint venture 

intersegment sales for the primary metals segment declined 21 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly as a result of lower demand from alcoa’s downstream businesses the absence of 10 months of shipments to the packaging and consumer businesses that occurred in 2007 and the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in 2007 intersegment sales decreased 20 in 2007 compared with 2006 due to the absence of shipments to the soft alloy extrusion business that occurred in 2006 and production curtailments associated with the tennessee and rockdale smelters that occurred in 2007 

atoi for the primary metals segment dropped 36 in 2008 compared with 2007 principally related to higher alumina carbon and energy costs increased spending on repairs and maintenance outside services and labor lower realized prices the impact of the 2008 curtailment of all production at rockdale 55 and unfavorable foreign currency movements due to a weaker us dollar these negative impacts were partially offset by the absence of costs incurred in 2007 associated with the following the startup of the iceland smelter the smelter production curtailment of one of the potlines in rockdale and the smelter curtailment associated with the power outage in tennessee atoi for this segment declined 18 in 2007 compared with 2006 as unfavorable foreign currency movements related to a weaker us dollar costs associated with the rockdale and tennessee smelter curtailments continued increases in raw material freight and energy costs and iceland smelter startup costs were partially offset by higher realized prices 

at december 31 2008 alcoa had 807 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4531 kmt in 2008 idle capacity increased by 355 kmt as compared to 2007 due to the complete production curtailment at rockdale 267 kmt and partial curtailments of approximately 88 kmt related to other smelters all of which are the result of current negative market conditions at december 31 2007 alcoa had 452 kmt of idle capacity on a base capacity of 4573 kmt in 2007 idle capacity decreased by 93 kmt as compared to 2006 due to the completed restart of one of intalco’s smelter lines base capacity increased by 364 kmt in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to the completion of the 344 kmt iceland smelter 

in 2009 alcoa will curtail production by an additional 395 kmt 750 kmt including the previously mentioned curtailments which includes all smelting at the tennessee operations 215 kmt by the end of the first quarter also input costs are expected to decrease while alcoa anticipates the realization of cost savings from recent procurement initiatives lastly realized prices may decline significantly based on the lme’s current prices and shortterm outlook 

flatrolled products 

 

   

this segment’s principal business is the production and sale of aluminum plate sheet foil and hard alloy extrusions this segment includes rigid container sheet rcs which is sold directly to customers in the packaging and consumer market and is used to produce aluminum beverage cans seasonal increases in rcs sales are generally experienced in the second and third quarters of the year this segment also includes sheet and plate used in the transportation building and construction and distribution markets mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables which is sold directly to customers and through distributors additionally hard alloy extrusions products which are also sold directly to customers and through distributors serve the distribution aerospace automotive and commercial transportation markets approximately onethird of the thirdparty sales in this segment consist of rcs while the remaining twothirds of thirdparty sales are derived from sheet and plate foil used in industrial markets and hard alloy extrusions while the customer base for flatrolled products is large a significant amount of sales of rcs sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers 

thirdparty sales for the flatrolled products segment decreased 4 in 2008 compared with 2007 the decline was principally due to lower volumes across all businesses mainly the result of weak end markets in north america and europe partially offset by positive foreign currency movements mostly due to a stronger euro and a favorable pricing and product mix thirdparty sales for this segment climbed 10 in 2007 compared with 2006 the increase was primarily due to passing through material price increases favorable product mix associated with aerospace higher volumes in the aerospace and packaging markets and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro these increases were somewhat offset by the absence of sales associated with the shutdown of the swansea uk can sheet facility in the first quarter of 2007 as well as lower volumes in the distribution automotive and commercial transportation markets 

atoi for the flatrolled products segment fell 87 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly the result of continued higher direct materials energy and other cost increases and lower volumes across all businesses partially offset by favorable pricing and product mix atoi for this segment declined 16 in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to cost increases for direct materials and energy higher rampup costs at facilities in both russia and china and the impact of distributor destocking in the second half of 2007 somewhat offset by favorable pricing and product mix and higher volumes in the markets noted previously 

in 2009 the weakness in most end markets is expected to continue resulting in declining volumes while lower input costs such as direct materials and energy are anticipated also the global foil business will be divested 

engineered products and solutions 

 

 this segment includes titanium aluminum and super alloy investment castings forgings and fasteners aluminum wheels integrated aluminum structural systems and architectural extrusions used in the aerospace automotive building and construction commercial transportation and power generation markets these products are sold directly to customers and through distributors in 2008 the ees business was classified as discontinued operations therefore all periods presented exclude the results of this business 

thirdparty sales for the engineered products and solutions segment increased 7 in 2008 compared with 2007 the improvement was primarily due to higher demand in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets favorable pricing in the building and construction market positive foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro and the addition of two fastener businesses acquired early in 2008 all of which was partially offset by significant volume declines in the commercial transportation market thirdparty sales for this segment increased 8 in 2007 compared with 2006 the improvement was principally due to aerospace and power generation increases and higher volumes and prices in the building and construction business more than offsetting the decline in commercial transportation 

  

atoi for the engineered products and solutions segment climbed 23 in 2008 compared with 2007 mainly due to continued strong demand and productivity improvements in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro and the positive contribution of the acquired fastener businesses all of which was somewhat offset by significantly lower volumes in the commercial transportation market atoi for this segment increased 15 in 2007 compared with 2006 largely due to continued strong demand and operational performance in the aerospace and industrial gas turbine markets favorable prices and higher volumes in the building and construction business and productivity improvements these positive impacts were partially offset by demand decline in the north america heavy truck market 

in 2009 market conditions in the commercial transportation and building and construction markets are expected to further weaken however it is anticipated that productivity initiatives will materialize to partially offset the market downturn also the lone remaining cast auto wheels facility will be closed and the transportation products europe business will be divested 

packaging and consumer 

 

 the businesses within this segment were sold to rank group limited in 2008 therefore this segment no longer contains any operations prior to the sale of these businesses this segment included consumer foodservice and flexible packaging products food and beverage closures and plastic sheet and film for the packaging industry the principal products in this segment included aluminum foil plastic wraps and bags plastic beverage and food closures flexible packaging products thermoformed plastic containers and extruded plastic sheet and film consumer products were marketed under brands including reynolds wrap ®  diamond ®  baco ®  and cutrite ®  seasonal increases generally occurred in the second and fourth quarters of the year for such products as consumer foil and plastic wraps and bags while seasonal slowdowns for closures generally occurred in the fourth quarter of the year products were generally sold directly to customers consisting of supermarkets beverage companies food processors retail chains and commercial foodservice distributors 

thirdparty sales for the packaging and consumer segment increased 2 in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to higher volume and favorable pricing and mix across all businesses 

atoi for the packaging and consumer segment climbed 56 in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to productivity improvements across all businesses and the cessation of depreciation beginning in october 2007 as the assets of this segment were classified as held for sale due to management’s announced intent to actively pursue the sale of these businesses

 environmental matters 

alcoa continues to participate in environmental assessments and cleanups at a number of locations these include 31 owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties 33 previously owned or operating facilities and adjoining properties and 71 waste sites including superfund sites a liability is recorded for environmental remediation when a cleanup program becomes probable and the costs or damages can be reasonably estimated 

as assessments and cleanups proceed the liability is adjusted based on progress made in determining the extent of remedial actions and related costs and damages the liability can change substantially due to factors such as the nature and extent of contamination changes in remedial requirements and technological changes 

  

the following discussion provides details regarding the current status of certain significant reserves related to current or former alcoa sites 

massena ny— alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena plant site under a 1989 order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs 

alcoa submitted various analysis of alternatives reports to the epa starting in 1998 through 2002 that reported the results of river and sediment studies potential alternatives for remedial actions related to the pcb contamination and additional information requested by the epa 

in june 2003 the epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup the results of these additional studies submitted in a report to the epa in april 2004 suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios the epa informed alcoa that a final remedial decision for the river could not be made without substantially more information including river pilot studies on the effects of ice formation and breakup on each of the remedial techniques alcoa submitted to the epa and the epa approved a remedial options pilot study rops to gather this information the scope of this study included sediment removal and capping the installation of an ice control structure and significant monitoring 

from 2004 through 2008 alcoa completed the work outlined in the rops in november 2008 alcoa submitted an updated analysis of alternatives report to the epa incorporating the new information obtained from the rops related to the feasibility and costs associated with various capping and dredging alternatives including options for ice control as a result alcoa increased the reserve associated with the grasse river by 40 for the estimated costs of a proposed ice control remedy and for partial settlement of potential damages of natural resources 

this new information will be used by the epa to select a remedy for the entire river the epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the epa’s record of decision is issued which is expected in 2009 or later 

sherwin tx— in connection with the sale of the sherwin alumina refinery which was required to be divested as part of the reynolds merger in 2000 alcoa agreed to retain responsibility for the remediation of the then existing environmental conditions as well as a pro rata share of the final closure of the active waste disposal areas which remain in use alcoa’s share of the closure costs is proportional to the total period of operation of the active waste disposal areas alcoa estimated its liability for the active disposal areas by making certain assumptions about the period of operation the amount of material placed in the area prior to closure and the appropriate technology engineering and regulatory status applicable to final closure 

east st louis il— in response to questions regarding environmental conditions at the former east st louis operations alcoa and the city of east st louis the owner of the site entered into an administrative order with the epa in december 2002 to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study of an area used for the disposal of bauxite residue from historic alumina refining operations a draft feasibility study was submitted to the epa in april 2005 the feasibility study included remedial alternatives that ranged from no further action to significant grading stabilization and water management of the bauxite residue disposal areas as a result alcoa increased the environmental reserve for this location by 15 in 2005 the epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the epa’s record of decision is issued which is expected late in 2009 or later 

vancouver wa— in 1987 alcoa sold its vancouver smelter to a company that is now known as evergreen aluminum evergreen the purchase and sale agreement contained a provision that alcoa retain liability for any environmental issues that arise subsequent to the sale that predate 1987 as a result of this obligation alcoa recorded a reserve for the vancouver location at that time evergreen decommissioned the smelter and cleaned up its portion of 

  

the site under a consent order with the washington department of ecology wde in february 2008 evergreen notified alcoa that it had identified numerous areas containing contamination that predated 1987 

separately in september 2008 alcoa completed a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs under the washington state model toxics control act and negotiated a consent decree with wde which requires alcoa to complete cleanup of pcb contaminated sediments in the columbia river as well as remediate soil contamination in upland portions of the vancouver property 

late in 2008 alcoa started cleanup work on the columbia river and discovered additional contamination and waste materials along the shoreline area and in upland areas in addition evergreen presented additional cost estimates for contaminated areas that were discovered since march 2008 

as a result of all of the above items related to the former vancouver site alcoa increased the environmental reserve by 16 in 2008 as cleanup work progresses and final remedies are negotiated with wde a subsequent reserve adjustment may be necessary 

based on the foregoing it is possible that alcoa’s financial position liquidity or results of operations in a particular period could be materially affected by matters relating to these sites however based on facts currently available management believes that adequate reserves have been provided and that the disposition of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial position liquidity or the results of operations of the company 

alcoa’s remediation reserve balance was 316 and 279 at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 of which 39 and 51 was classified as a current liability respectively and reflects the most probable costs to remediate identified environmental conditions for which costs can be reasonably estimated in 2008 the remediation reserve was increased by 69 mostly due to the adjustments related to the grasse river and former vancouver property discussed above in 2007 the remediation reserve was decreased by 10 consisting of a 15 adjustment for the liabilities associated with a previously owned smelter site and a 5 adjustment for liabilities at the russian rolling mills and extrusion plants both of which were partially offset by a net increase of 10 in liabilities associated with various locations the 15 and 5 adjustments were made after further investigations were completed and alcoa was able to obtain additional information about the environmental condition and the associated liabilities related to these sites the changes to the remediation reserve were recorded in cost of goods sold on the statement of consolidated operations in both periods payments related to remediation expenses applied against the reserve were 32 and 30 in 2008 and 2007 respectively these amounts include expenditures currently mandated as well as those not required by any regulatory authority or third party 

included in annual operating expenses are the recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and environmental programs these costs are estimated to be approximately 2 of cost of goods sold 

liquidity and capital resources 

alcoa takes a very disciplined approach to cash management and strengthening of its balance sheet management faced the significant challenge of maintaining this approach while providing the company with the necessary liquidity to operate effectively especially in the second half of 2008 in response to recent changes in the economic markets across the globe management reacted quickly to solidify alcoa’s liquidity position the following actions were initiated in the second half of 2008 to conserve cash and preserve liquidity greater scrutiny over the daily management of alcoa’s cash position higher risk tolerance on raw materials with lower minimum order quantities and lower carrying levels targeted headcount reductions across the globe a salary and hiring freeze at the corporate level suspension of the existing share repurchase program and the addition of a new 364day 1900 revolving credit facility a number of changes were also made to alcoa’s capital expenditures strategy as follows capital expenditure approval levels were lowered dramatically growth projects were halted where it was deemed economically feasible and all noncritical capital expenditures were stopped capital expenditures are deemed critical if they maintain alcoa’s compliance with the law keep a facility operating or satisfy customer requirements if the benefits outweigh the costs the planned sale 

  

or shutdown of various businesses will also contribute positively to alcoa’s liquidity position in 2009 along with the foregoing actions cash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover alcoa’s current operational and business needs for a discussion of longterm liquidity see the disclosures included in contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

cash from operations 

cash from operations in 2008 was 1234 compared with 3111 in 2007 resulting in a decrease of 1877 or 60 the decline of 1877 was primarily due to a decrease in earnings after taking into account noncash income and expenses a 988 cash outflow associated with working capital 201 in higher pension contributions and the absence of 93 in cash received on a longterm aluminum supply contract these cash outflows were slightly offset by a 336 cash inflow related to noncurrent assets and liabilities and a 97 increase in cash provided from discontinued operations the major components of the 988 change in working capital are as follows a 351 smaller decrease in receivables primarily as a result of improved sales from most businesses not classified as held for sale a 522 increase in inventories mostly due to higher costs of raw materials and other inputs a 156 smaller increase in accounts payable trade a 209 decrease in accrued expenses and a 213 increase in taxes including taxes on income 

cash from operations in 2007 was 3111 compared with 2567 in 2006 resulting in an increase of 544 or 21 the improvement of 544 is principally related to a 1415 positive change associated with working capital primarily due to improvements in receivables inventories and accounts payable and accrued expenses higher net income of 316 and a cash inflow of 93 related to a longterm aluminum supply contract these positive impacts were partially offset by a significant increase in noncash adjustments mostly related to the sale of the chalco investment 

financing activities 

cash provided from financing activities was 1478 in 2008 compared with cash used for financing activities of 1538 in 2007 the change of 3016 was primarily due to a 1414 reduction in the repurchase of common stock mainly the result of the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program a 1296 change in commercial paper principally due to an increase in commercial paper issued and the absence of a 1132 reduction of commercial paper with the proceeds from newlyissued longterm debt in january 2007 and a 669 decrease in payments on longterm debt mostly due to the purchase 333 and repayment 459 of 425 notes due august 2007 as compared to the repayment of 150 in 6625 notes due march 2008 these cash inflows were somewhat offset by a 658 decline in common stock issued for compensation plans primarily due to fewer stock option exercises as result of the significant decline in the market price of alcoa’s common stock 

cash used for financing activities was 1538 in 2007 compared with 20 in 2006 the change of 1518 was primarily due to a 2206 increase in the repurchase of common stock due to a significant increase in the number of shares repurchased as a result of the january 2007 and october 2007 authorized programs a 1177 change in the net change in commercial paper mostly due to the repayment of commercial paper with the majority of the proceeds from the issuance of new longterm debt in 2007 an 837 increase in payments on longterm debt primarily related to the january 2007 purchase of 333 of outstanding 425 notes due august 2007 and the repayment of the remaining 459 of outstanding 425 notes in august 2007 126 in payments for debt issuance costs including a commitment fee of 30 paid to secure a credit facility related to the offer for alcan inc and a 66 increase in dividends paid to shareholders as a result of the eight cents per share annual increase approved in january 2007 partially offsetting these cash inflows was a 2021 increase in additions to longterm debt principally due to proceeds received of 1994 net of 6 in original issue discounts from the issuance of new 555 notes due 2017 59 notes due 2027 and 595 notes due 2037 a 679 increase in common stock issued for stock compensation plans related to cash received for the exercise of stock options and a 132 increase in minority interest contributions primarily from an increase in contributions received from alumina limited related to their share of capital spending at the são luís and juruti facilities 

in october 2007 alcoa entered into a fiveyear revolving credit agreement dated as of october 2 2007 the “credit agreement” with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein the credit agreement provides a 3250 senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “credit facility” the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working 

  

capital or for other general corporate purposes of alcoa including support of alcoa’s commercial paper program subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement alcoa may from time to time request increases in lender commitments under the credit facility not to exceed 500 in aggregate principal amount and may also request the issuance of letters of credit subject to a letter of credit sublimit of 500 under the credit facility 

the credit facility matures on october 2 2012 unless extended or earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the credit agreement alcoa may make two oneyear extension requests during the term of the credit facility with any extension being subject to the lender consent requirements set forth in the credit agreement 

the credit facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pari passu with all other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of alcoa borrowings under the credit facility may be denominated in us dollars or euros loans will bear interest at i a base rate or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of alcoa’s outstanding senior unsecured longterm debt the applicable margin on libor loans will be 033 per annum based on alcoa’s longterm debt ratings as of december 31 2008 loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty subject to customary breakage costs 

the credit facility replaces 3000 in aggregate principal amount of revolving credit facilities maintained by alcoa under the following credit agreements which were terminated effective october 2 2007 i 1000 fiveyear revolving credit agreement dated as of april 22 2005 ii 1000 fiveyear revolving credit agreement dated as of april 23 2004 as amended and iii 1000 fiveyear revolving credit agreement dated as of april 25 2003 as amended collectively the “former credit agreements” 

the credit agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the former credit agreements including among others a a leverage ratio b limitations on alcoa’s ability to incur liens securing indebtedness for borrowed money c limitations on alcoa’s ability to consummate a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets and d limitations on alcoa’s ability to change the nature of its business 

the obligation of alcoa to pay amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an “event of default” as defined in the credit agreement such events of default include among others a alcoa’s failure to pay the principal of or interest on borrowings under the credit facility b any representation or warranty of alcoa in the credit agreement proving to be materially false or misleading c alcoa’s breach of any of its covenants contained in the credit agreement and d the bankruptcy or insolvency of alcoa 

in july 2008 alcoa increased the capacity of the credit facility by 175 as provided for under the credit agreement in october 2008 lehman commercial paper inc lcpi a lender under the credit agreement with 150 in commitments filed for bankruptcy protection under section 11 of the united states bankruptcy code it is not certain if lcpi will honor its obligations under the credit agreement the total capacity of the credit facility excluding lcpi’s commitment is 3275 

there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility at december 31 2008 and 2007

investing activities 

cash used for investing activities was 2410 in 2008 compared with 1625 in 2007 the increase in cash used of 785 was mainly due to a decline of 1939 in sales of investments as a result of the absence of the 1942 in proceeds received from the sale of the chalco investment a 1172 increase in additions to investments due to the 1200 investment made in shining prospect pte ltd to acquire common stock of rio tinto plc and a 399 rise in acquisitions including minority interests driven by the purchase of two aerospace fastener manufacturing businesses for 276 the buyout of the outstanding minority interest in bohai for 79 and a 47 contingent payment made to camargo corrêa group related to the 2003 acquisition of 409 of alcoa alumínio sa these cash outflows were principally offset by a 2527 increase in proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses mostly related to the 2651 in net proceeds received from the sale of the businesses within the packaging and consumer segment 

cash used for investing activities was 1625 in 2007 compared with 2841 in 2006 the decrease in cash used of 1216 was primarily due to a 1976 increase in sales of investments mostly related to the 1942 in proceeds received from the sale of the chalco investment this cash inflow was partially offset by a 431 increase in capital expenditures principally related to higher spending on certain growth projects including the são luís refinery expansion the development of the juruti bauxite mine and projects at various facilities in russia hungary and china all of which were partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures related to the iceland smelter and the mosjøen anode facility as these two projects were placed in service during 2007 and the early works program in jamaica as this project was completed near the end of 2006 and a decrease of 189 in proceeds from the sales of assets and businesses principally due to the 305 in cash received for the sale of the home exteriors business in 2006 as compared to the 70 and 33 in cash received from the sales of a mine in texas and the automotive castings business respectively in 2007 

capital expenditures were 3438 in 2008 compared with 3636 and 3205 in 2007 and 2006 respectively of the total capital expenditures in 2008 approximately 58 related to growth projects including the refinery expansion in são luís the development of the juruti bauxite mine the estreito hydroelectric power project in brazil and projects at various facilities in russia and china also included are costs related to environmental control in new and expanded facilities totaling 241 in 2008 274 in 2007 and 182 in 2006 total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately 1800 in 2009 approximately half of which is expected to occur in the first half of 2009 related to the são luís refinery expansion and the development of the juruti bauxite mine 

alcoa added 1303 131 and 58 to its investments in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively as noted above in 2008 alcoa invested 1200 in shining prospect pte ltd to acquire common stock of rio tinto plc in 2008 2007 and 2006 alcoa invested an additional 9 31 and 26 respectively in the dampier to bunbury natural gas pipeline in western australia also in 2008 alcoa made additional investments related to its serra do facão hydroelectric power project in brazil 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosed in the accompanying notes areas that require significant judgments estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities environmental matters asset retirement obligations the testing of goodwill equity investments and properties plants and equipment for impairment estimated proceeds on businesses to be divested pension plans and other postretirement benefits stockbased compensation and income taxes 

  

management uses historical experience and all available information to make these judgments estimates and assumptions and actual results may differ from those used to prepare the company’s consolidated financial statements at any given time despite these inherent limitations management believes that management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the company a discussion of the judgments estimates assumptions and uncertainties associated with accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and environmental matters can be found in the market risks and derivative activities and the environmental matters sections respectively 

a summary of the company’s significant accounting policies is included in note a to the consolidated financial statements management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the consolidated financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company’s operating results and financial condition 

asset retirement obligations alcoa recognizes asset retirement obligations aros related to legal obligations associated with the normal operation of alcoa’s bauxite mining alumina refining and aluminum smelting facilities these aros consist primarily of costs associated with spent pot lining disposal closure of bauxite residue areas mine reclamation and landfill closure alcoa also recognizes aros for any significant lease restoration obligation if required by a lease agreement and for the disposal of regulated waste materials related to the demolition of certain power facilities the fair values of these aros are recorded on a discounted basis at the time the obligation is incurred and accreted over time for the change in present value additionally alcoa capitalizes asset retirement costs by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived assets and depreciating these assets over their remaining useful life 

certain conditional asset retirement obligations caros related to alumina refineries aluminum smelters and fabrication facilities have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements due to uncertainties surrounding the ultimate settlement date a caro is a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within alcoa’s control such uncertainties exist as a result of the perpetual nature of the structures maintenance and upgrade programs and other factors at the date a reasonable estimate of the ultimate settlement date can be made alcoa would record a retirement obligation for the removal treatment transportation storage and or disposal of various regulated assets and hazardous materials such as asbestos underground and aboveground storage tanks pcbs various process residuals solid wastes electronic equipment waste and various other materials such amounts may be material to the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are recorded if alcoa was required to demolish all such structures immediately the estimated caro as of december 31 2008 ranges from less than 1 to 52 per structure 157 structures in today’s dollars 

goodwill goodwill is not amortized instead it is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell a business a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred such indicators may include a decline in expected cash flows a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate unanticipated competition or slower growth rates among others 

goodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment alcoa has 10 reporting units of which three are included in the flatrolled products segment and five are included in the engineered products and solutions segment the remaining two reporting units are the alumina and primary metals segments almost 90 of alcoa’s total goodwill is allocated to three reporting units as follows alcoa fastening systems afs 1014 and alcoa power and propulsion app 1601 businesses both of which are included in the engineered products and solutions segment and primary metals 1767 these amounts include an allocation of corporate goodwill 

the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value including goodwill alcoa uses a discounted cash flow model dcf model to estimate the current fair value of its 

  

reporting units when testing for impairment a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows including markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs to produce tax rates capital spending discount rate and working capital changes most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years the betas used in calculating the individual reporting units’ weighted average cost of capital wacc rate are estimated for each business with the assistance of valuation experts 

in 2008 the estimated fair value of nine of the ten reporting units including afs and app were well in excess of the carrying value of these businesses resulting in no impairment for primary metals while the estimated fair value of this business exceeded its carrying value the excess was significantly impacted due to the historic drop in the lme price that occurred in the second half of 2008 management performed an updated goodwill impairment test for primary metals in late december 2008 which again resulted in no impairment the tests for the other nine reporting units were also updated 

historically lme pricing levels and the corresponding input costs eg raw materials energy have generally trended in the same manner resulting in relatively consistent cash margins over time as a result the estimated fair value of primary metals traditionally has been well in excess of its carrying value however during the second half of 2008 the lme price decreased at an unprecedented rate significantly outpacing any decreases in associated input costs as a result of this nearterm disruption in the historical relationship between lme and input costs the expected cash margins in the early years in the dcf model were lower than normal and lower than longterm expectations 

in the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the dcf model is less than the carrying value additional analysis would be required the additional analysis would compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the implied fair value of that goodwill which may involve the use of valuation experts the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value amounts assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit represented the purchase price if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value an impairment loss equal to such excess would be recognized which could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations and shareholders’ equity 

with alcoa’s common stock price at extraordinary lows late in 2008 management analyzed the valuations derived from the dcf models in relation to alcoa’s market capitalization in management’s judgment a significant portion of the recent decline in alcoa’s stock price is related to the current unprecedented liquidity crisis in the overall economy and is not reflective of the underlying cash flows of the reporting units as a result management believes the company’s forecasted cash flows constitute a better indicator of the current fair value of alcoa’s reporting units than the current pricing of its common shares the sum of the individual estimated fair values of alcoa’s reporting units per the dcf models is greater than the market value of alcoa’s common stock however fair values that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from those used to evaluate the impairment of goodwill 

equity investments alcoa invests in a number of privatelyheld companies primarily through joint ventures and consortiums these investments are accounted for on the equity method and include the company’s investment in shining prospect pte ltd the equity method is applied in situations where alcoa has the ability to exercise significant influence but not control over the investee management reviews equity investments for impairment whenever certain indicators are present suggesting that the carrying value of an investment is not recoverable this analysis requires a significant amount of judgment from management to identify events or circumstances indicating that an equity investment is impaired the following items are examples of impairment indicators significant sustained declines in an investee’s revenue earnings and cash flow trends adverse market conditions of the investee’s industry or geographic area the investee’s ability to continue operations measured by several items including liquidity and other factors once an impairment indicator is identified management uses considerable judgment to determine if the impairment is other than temporary in which case the equity investment is written down to its estimated fair value an impairment that is other than temporary could significantly and adversely impact reported results of operations 

  

properties plants and equipment properties plants and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations related to the assets asset group to their carrying amount an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets asset group over their fair value with fair value determined using the best information available which generally is a dcf model 

discontinued operations and assets held for sale the fair values of all businesses to be divested are estimated using accepted valuation techniques such as a dcf model valuations performed by third parties earnings multiples or indicative bids when available a number of significant estimates and assumptions are involved in the application of these techniques including the forecasting of markets and market share sales volumes and prices costs and expenses and multiple other factors management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the estimates are made however the fair values that are ultimately realized upon the sale of the businesses to be divested may differ from the estimated fair values reflected in the consolidated financial statements 

pension plans and other postretirement benefits liabilities and expenses for pension plans and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality the rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined considering the rates available at yearend on debt instruments that could be used to settle the obligations of the plan the impact on the liabilities of a change in the discount rate of 14 of 1 is approximately 325 and either a charge or credit of 16 to aftertax earnings in the following year the longterm rate of return on plan assets is estimated by considering historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of assets a change in the assumption for the longterm rate of return on plan assets of 14 of 1 would impact aftertax earnings by approximately 15 for 2009 although the 10year moving average of actual performance fell below 9 for the first time in 20 years the 20year moving average has continued to exceed 9 the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets will be reduced to 875 for 2009 reflecting recent market conditions 

in 2008 a net charge of 2181 1374 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive loss primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of plan assets which was somewhat offset by the decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation as a result of a 20 basispoint increase in the discount rate and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs additionally a charge of 8 was recorded in other comprehensive loss due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy in 2007 a net credit of 659 426 aftertax was recorded in other comprehensive income due to a net decrease in the accumulated benefit obligations as a result of a 25 basispoint increase in the discount rate which was partially offset by plan amendments and the recognition of actuarial losses and prior service costs additionally a credit of 80 was recorded in other comprehensive income due to the reclassification of deferred taxes related to the medicare part d prescription drug subsidy 

stockbased compensation alcoa recognizes compensation expense for employee equity grants using the nonsubstantive vesting period approach in which the expense net of estimated forfeitures is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value the fair value of each new stock option is estimated on the date of grant using a latticepricing model determining the fair value of stock options at the grant date requires judgment including estimates for the average riskfree interest rate dividend yield volatility annual forfeiture rate and exercise behavior if any of these assumptions differ significantly from actual stockbased compensation expense could be impacted 

as part of alcoa’s stockbased compensation plan design individuals who are retirementeligible have a sixmonth requisite service period in the year of grant equity grants are issued in january each year as a result a larger portion of expense will be recognized in the first and second quarters of each year for these retirementeligible employees compensation expense recorded in 2008 2007 and 2006 was 94 63 aftertax 97 63 aftertax and 72 48 

  

aftertax respectively of this amount 19 19 and 20 in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively pertains to the acceleration of expense related to retirementeligible employees 

on december 31 2005 alcoa accelerated the vesting of 11 million unvested stock options granted to employees in 2004 and on january 13 2005 the 2004 and 2005 accelerated options had weighted average exercise prices of 3560 and 2954 respectively and in the aggregate represented approximately 12 of alcoa’s total outstanding options the decision to accelerate the vesting of the 2004 and 2005 options was made primarily to avoid recognizing the related compensation expense in future consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of a new accounting standard the accelerated vesting of the 2004 and 2005 stock options reduced alcoa’s aftertax stock option compensation expense in 2007 and 2006 by 7 and 21 respectively 

beginning in 2006 plan participants can choose whether to receive their award in the form of stock options stock awards or a combination of both this choice is made before the grant is issued and is irrevocable 

income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of alcoa’s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold otherwise these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled which means that the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open or the statute of limitation expires interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized alcoa also has unamortized taxdeductible goodwill of 397 resulting from intercompany stock sales and reorganizations generally at a 30 to 34 rate alcoa recognizes the tax benefits associated with this taxdeductible goodwill as it is being amortized for local income tax purposes rather than in the period in which the transaction is consummated 

related party transactions 

alcoa buys products from and sells products to various related companies consisting of entities in which alcoa retains a 50 or less equity interest at negotiated armslength prices between the two parties these transactions were not material to the financial position or results of operations of alcoa for all periods presented 

recently adopted accounting standards 

on january 1 2008 alcoa adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities – including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” sfas 159 sfas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrumentbyinstrument basis the fair value option with changes in fair value reported in earnings alcoa already records marketable securities at fair value in accordance with sfas no 115 “accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities” and derivative contracts and hedging activities at fair value in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended sfas 133 the adoption of sfas 159 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements as management did not elect the fair value option for any other financial instruments or certain other assets and liabilities 

on january 1 2008 alcoa adopted sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities in february 2008 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no fas 1572 “effective date of fasb statement no 157” which delayed the effective date of 

  

sfas 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis until january 1 2009 for calendar yearend entities also in february 2008 the fasb issued fsp no fas 1571 “application of fasb statement no 157 to fasb statement no 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement 13” which states that sfas no 13 “accounting for leases” sfas 13 and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under sfas 13 are excluded from the provisions of sfas 157 except for assets and liabilities related to leases assumed in a business combination that are required to be measured at fair value under sfas no 141 “business combinations” sfas 141 or sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” sfas 141r 

sfas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and are to be applied prospectively with limited exceptions the adoption of sfas 157 as it relates to financial assets had no impact on the consolidated financial statements management has determined that the adoption of sfas 157 as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 

sfas 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date this standard is now the single source in gaap for the definition of fair value except for the fair value of leased property as defined in sfas 13 sfas 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between 1 market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and 2 an entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 3 the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under sfas 157 are described below 

 

  

  

 the following sections describe the valuation methodologies used by alcoa to measure different financial instruments at fair value including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which each instrument is generally classified where appropriate the description includes details of the valuation models the key inputs to those models and any significant assumptions 

availableforsale securities alcoa uses quoted market prices to determine the fair value of availableforsale securities these financial instruments consist of exchangetraded fixed income and equity securities and are classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy 

derivative contracts derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and significant other observable and unobservable inputs such financial instruments consist of aluminum interest rate commodity principally energyrelated and foreign currency contracts the fair values for the majority of these derivative contracts are based upon current quoted market prices these financial instruments are typically exchangetraded and are generally classified within level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy depending on whether the exchange is deemed to be an active market or not 

  

for certain derivative contracts whose fair values are based upon trades in liquid markets such as aluminum options valuation model inputs can generally be verified and valuation techniques do not involve significant management judgment the fair values of such financial instruments are generally classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy 

alcoa has other derivative contracts that do not have observable market quotes for these financial instruments management uses significant other observable inputs ie information concerning time premiums and volatilities for certain option type embedded derivatives and regional premiums for swaps for periods beyond the term of quoted market prices for aluminum alcoa uses a macroeconomic model that estimates the longterm price of aluminum based on anticipated changes in worldwide supply and demand where appropriate valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity bidoffer spreads and credit considerations such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence level 2 in the absence of such evidence management’s best estimate is used level 3 

the following table presents alcoa’s assets and liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis classified under the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy as of december 31 2008 

 

  

 financial instruments classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy represent derivative contracts in which management has used at least one significant unobservable input in the valuation model the following table presents a reconciliation of activity for such derivative contracts on a net basis 

 

   

as reflected in the table above the net unrealized loss on derivative contracts using level 3 valuation techniques was 341 as of december 31 2008 this loss is mainly attributed to embedded derivatives in a power contract that index the price of power to the lme price of aluminum these embedded derivatives are primarily valued using observable market prices however due to the length of the contract the valuation model also requires management to estimate the longterm price of aluminum based upon anticipated changes in worldwide supply and demand the embedded derivatives have been designated as hedges of forward sales of aluminum and their realized gains and losses are included in sales on the statement of consolidated operations also included within level 3 measurements are derivative financial instruments that hedge the cost of electricity transactions involving onpeak power are observable as there is an active market however due to alcoa’s power consumption there are certain offpeak times when there is not an actively traded market for electricity therefore management utilizes various forecast services historical relationships and near term market actual pricing to determine the fair value gains and losses realized for the electricity contracts are included in cost of goods sold on the statement of consolidated operations additionally an embedded derivative in a power contract that indexes the difference between the longterm debt ratings of alcoa and the counterparty from any of the three major credit rating agencies is included in level 3 management uses forecast services historical relationships and market prices to determine fair value none of the level 3 positions on hand at december 31 2008 resulted in any unrealized gains in the statement of consolidated operations 

effective september 30 2008 alcoa adopted fsp no fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active” fsp fas 1573 which was issued on october 10 2008 fsp fas 1573 clarifies the application of sfas 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active the adoption of fsp fas 1573 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 

on january 1 2008 alcoa adopted fsp no fin 391 “amendment of fasb interpretation no 39” fsp fin 391 fsp fin 391 amends fin no 39 “offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts” by permitting entities that enter into master netting arrangements as part of their derivative transactions to offset in their financial statements net derivative positions against the fair value of amounts or amounts that approximate fair value recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral under those arrangements as a result management elected to net cash collateral against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty when a master netting arrangement exists the provisions of fsp fin 391 are to be applied retroactively for all financial statement periods presented as of december 31 2008 the obligation to return cash collateral in the amount of 67 was netted against the fair value of derivative contracts of which 4 is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and 63 is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet and the right to receive cash collateral in the amount of 119 was netted against the fair value of derivative contracts included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet the adoption of fsp fin 391 did not impact the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007 as no cash collateral was held or posted

contractual obligations and offbalance sheet arrangements 

contractual obligations alcoa is required to make future payments under various contracts including longterm purchase obligations debt agreements and lease agreements alcoa also has commitments to fund its pension plans provide payments for postretirement benefit plans and finance capital projects these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the statement of consolidated cash flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information as of december 31 2008 a summary of alcoa’s outstanding contractual obligations is as follows 

 

 obligations for operating activities 

energyrelated purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from less than 1 year to 40 years the majority of raw material and other purchase obligations have expiration dates of 24 months or less certain purchase obligations contain variable pricing components and as a result actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table operating leases represent multiyear obligations for certain computer equipment plant equipment vehicles and buildings 

interest related to total debt is based on interest rates in effect as of december 31 2008 and is calculated on debt with maturities that extend to 2037 the effect of outstanding interest rate swaps which are accounted for as fair value hedges are included in interest related to total debt as of december 31 2008 these hedges effectively convert the interest rate from fixed to floating on 1890 of debt through 2018 as the contractual interest rates for certain debt and interest rate swaps are variable actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table 

estimated minimum required pension funding and postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for discount rates longterm rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates the minimum required cash outlays for pension funding are estimated to be 140 for 2009 and 590 for 2010 the increase in the projected funding is the result of a significant decline in the fair value of plan assets and the reduction of available pension funding credits from 2009 to 2010 the funding estimate is 600 for 2011 530 for 2012 and 510 for 2013 the expected pension contributions in 2009 and later reflect the impacts of the pension protection act of 2006 that was signed into law on august 17 2006 pension contributions are expected to decline beginning in 2014 if all actuarial assumptions are realized and remain the same in the future postretirement 

  

benefit payments are expected to approximate 300 annually net of the estimated subsidy receipts related to medicare part d and are reflected in the preceding table through 2018 alcoa has determined that it is not practicable to present pension funding and postretirement benefit payments beyond 2013 and 2018 respectively 

layoff and other restructuring payments primarily relate to severance costs and are expected to be paid within one year amounts scheduled to be paid greater than one year are related to ongoing site remediation work special termination benefit payments and lease termination costs 

deferred revenue arrangements require alcoa to deliver aluminum and alumina over the specified contract period while these obligations are not expected to result in cash payments they represent contractual obligations for which the company would be obligated if the specified product deliveries could not be made the longest such contract expires in 2027 

uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities the amount in the preceding table includes interest and penalties accrued related to such positions as of december 31 2008 the total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the “thereafter” column as the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments if a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires then additional payments will not be necessary 

obligations for financing activities 

total debt amounts in the preceding table represent the principal amounts of all outstanding debt including shortterm borrowings commercial paper and longterm debt maturities for longterm debt extend to 2037 

the company has historically paid quarterly dividends on its preferred and common stock including dividends on preferred stock alcoa paid 556 in dividends to shareholders during 2008 because all dividends are subject to approval by alcoa’s board of directors amounts are not included in the preceding table until such authorization has occurred as of december 31 2008 there were 800317368 and 546024 shares of common stock and preferred stock outstanding respectively in january 2007 alcoa increased its annual common stock dividend from 060 per share to 068 per share

payments related to acquisitions are based on provisions in certain acquisition agreements that state additional funds are due to the seller from alcoa if the businesses acquired achieve stated financial and operational thresholds amounts are only presented in the preceding table if it is has been determined that payment is more likely than not to occur in connection with an acquisition made prior to 2006 alcoa could be required to make additional contingent payments of approximately 85 through 2015 but are not included in the preceding table as they have not met such standard 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2008 alcoa has maximum potential future payments for guarantees issued on behalf of certain third parties of 230 these guarantees expire in 2015 through 2018 and relate to project financing for hydroelectric power projects in brazil alcoa also has outstanding bank guarantees related to legal customs duties and leasing obligations among others which expire at various dates that total 389 at december 31 2008

alcoa had an existing program with a different thirdparty to sell certain customer receivables the sale of receivables under this program was conducted through a qualifying special purpose entity qspe that was bankruptcy remote and therefore was not consolidated by alcoa effective august 31 2008 alcoa terminated this program and all outstanding accounts receivable were collected by the qspe through the end of 2008 as of december 31 2007 alcoa sold trade receivables of 139 to the qspe 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in addition to the risks inherent in its operations alcoa is exposed to financial market political and economic risks the following discussion provides information regarding alcoa’s exposure to the risks of changing commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 

alcoa’s commodity and derivative activities are subject to the management direction and control of the strategic risk management committee srmc the srmc is composed of the chief executive officer the chief financial officer and other officers and employees that the chief executive officer selects the srmc reports to the board of directors on the scope of its activities 

the interest rate foreign currency aluminum and other commodity contracts are held for purposes other than trading they are used primarily to mitigate uncertainty and volatility and to cover underlying exposures the company is not involved in trading activities for energy weather derivatives or other nonexchange commodities 

commodity price risks— alcoa is a leading global producer of primary aluminum and aluminum fabricated products as a condition of sale customers often require alcoa to enter into longterm fixedprice commitments these commitments expose alcoa to the risk of higher aluminum prices between the time the order is committed and the time that the order is shipped alcoa uses futures contracts totaling 760 kmt at december 31 2008 to reduce the aluminum price risk associated with a portion of these fixedprice firm commitments the effects of this hedging activity will be recognized in earnings over the designated hedge periods in 2009 to 2012 

alcoa also sells aluminum products to third parties at thencurrent market prices and is exposed to the risk of lower market prices at the time of shipment alcoa has also entered into futures contracts totaling 358 kmt at december 31 2008 to hedge a portion of future production the effects of this hedging activity will be recognized in earnings over the designated hedge periods in 2009 to 2011 

alcoa has also entered into futures contracts to minimize its price risk related to other customer sales and pricing arrangements alcoa has not qualified these contracts for hedge accounting treatment and therefore the fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings these contracts totaled 46 kmt at december 31 2008 in 

  

addition alcoa has power supply and other contracts that contain pricing provisions related to the lme aluminum price the lmelinked pricing features are considered embedded derivatives a majority of these embedded derivatives have been designated as hedges of future sales of aluminum gains and losses on the remainder of these embedded derivatives are recognized in earnings 

the net marktomarket pretax earnings impact from aluminum derivative and hedging activities was a gain of 78 in 2008 

alcoa purchases certain energy commodities to meet its production requirements and believes it is highly likely that such purchases will continue in the future these purchases expose the company to the risk of higher prices to hedge a portion of these risks alcoa uses futures and forward contracts the effects of this hedging activity will be recognized in earnings over the designated hedge periods in 2009 to 2011 

financial risk 

interest rates— alcoa uses interest rate swaps to help maintain a strategic balance between fixed and floatingrate debt and to manage overall financing costs for a portion of its fixedrate debt the company has entered into pay floating receive fixed interest rate swaps to effectively change the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates alcoa is also subject to an exposure in the differential between its longterm debt rating and the longterm debt rating of its counterparty in a longterm power contract which begins in 2011 and expires in 2028 

currencies— alcoa is subject to exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates foreign currency exchange contracts may be used from time to time to hedge the variability in cash flows from the forecasted payment or receipt of currencies other than the functional currency these contracts cover periods consistent with known or expected exposures through 2009 

fair values and sensitivity analysis— the following table shows the fair values of outstanding derivative contracts at december 31 2008 and the effect on fair values of a hypothetical change increase or decrease of 10 in the market prices or rates that existed at december 31 2008 

 

  

 aluminum consists primarily of losses on hedge contracts embedded derivatives in power contracts in iceland and brazil and alcoa’s share of gains and losses on hedge contracts of norwegian smelters that are accounted for under the equity method 

material limitations— the disclosures with respect to commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange risk do not take into account the underlying commitments or anticipated transactions if the underlying items were included in the analysis the gains or losses on the futures contracts would be offset actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not under alcoa’s control and could vary significantly from those factors disclosed 

  

alcoa is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments as well as credit or performance risk with respect to its hedged customers’ commitments although nonperformance is possible alcoa does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these parties contracts are with creditworthy counterparties and are further supported by cash treasury bills or irrevocable letters of credit issued by carefully chosen banks in addition various master netting arrangements are in place with counterparties to facilitate settlement of gains and losses on these contracts

alcoa owns interests in the following primary aluminum facilities that are accounted for on the equity or cost basis method the capacity associated with these facilities is not included in alcoa’s consolidated capacity 

 

  

  

 energy 

alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power electric power accounts for approximately 30 of the company’s primary aluminum costs alcoa generates approximately 24 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters 

north america – electricity 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 25 of the power requirements for alcoa’s north american smelters the company generally purchases the remainder under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates two hydroelectric projects tapoco and yadkin consisting of eight dams under federal energy regulatory commission ferc licenses apgi hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at alcoa tennessee and badin north carolina the tennessee smelter also purchases power from the tennessee valley authority under a contract that extends to 2010 

apgi received a renewed 40year ferc license for the tapoco project in 2005 the relicensing process is well underway for the yadkin hydroelectric project license that is up for renewal in 2008 in may 2007 apgi filed with ferc a relicensing settlement agreement with the majority of the interested stakeholders that broadly resolved open issues the national environmental policy act process is underway with a draft environmental impact statement having been issued in september 2007 this process is expected to be completed during 2008 with a new project license issued shortly thereafter with the badin smelter idled power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing llc and then sold into the wholesale market 

in the pacific northwest alcoa has a contract with chelan county public utility district chelan pud located in the state of washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the wenatchee smelter through october 2011 in december 2007 the chelan pud commissioners approved the terms of an agreement under which alcoa and chelan pud would enter into a new contract beginning in november 2011 and running through october 2028 under which alcoa would receive approximately 25 of the hydropower output of chelan pud’s rocky reach and rock island dams definitive agreements are expected to be finalized in the course of the year in addition alcoa has a 

  

contract through september 2011 with the bonneville power administration under which alcoa is receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power purchased from the market to partially operate the intalco smelter 

the company through apgi generates substantially all of the power used at its warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves in may 2005 alcoa acquired mining rights to the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves and subsequently hired vigo coal company inc to manage and operate the mine the mine is producing approximately one million tons of coal per year 45 of the warrick power plant’s requirements the balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration in april 2001 under the terms of an operating agreement the company assumed from vectren formerly southern indiana gas  electric company operation of the power plant that supplies the warrick smelter in july 2005 alcoa announced its plans to invest approximately 525 million at the warrick power plant to improve environmental performance and operational efficiency as well as to lower costs this project is well underway 

power for the rockdale smelter was historically generated by companyowned generating units and txu generation company lp txuowned generating units both of which used lignite supplied by the company’s sandow mine upon completion of lignite mining in the sandow mine in 2005 lignite supply transitioned to the companyowned three oaks mine the company retired its three whollyowned generating units in late 2006 and transitioned to an arrangement under which txu supplies all of the rockdale smelter’s electricity requirements under a longterm power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038 with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price in august 2007 txu and alcoa closed on the definitive agreements under which txu will construct own and operate a new circulating fluidized bed power plant adjacent to the existing sandow unit four power plant and in september 2007 on the sale of the three oaks mine to txu 

in the northeast the purchased power contracts for both the massena east and massena west smelters in new york expire not earlier than june 30 2013 following their extension in 2003 for 10 years upon new york power authority nypa having relicensed its st lawrencefdr hydro project in december 2007 alcoa and nypa reached agreement in principle on a new energy contract to supply the massena east and massena west smelters for 30 years beginning on july 1 2013 work on a definitive agreement is underway 

the deschambault and bécancour smelters in quebec purchase electricity under longterm contracts with hydroquebec that expire in 2014 subject to extension provisions the smelter located in baie comeau quebec purchases approximately 65 of its power needs under the hydroquebec contract and receives the remainder from a 40owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power company 

the mt holly smelter in south carolina purchases electricity from santee cooper under a contract that expires december 31 2015 subject to certain extension provisions 

at the end of 2005 all production was temporarily curtailed at the eastalco smelter located in frederick maryland the curtailment coincided with the expiration of the smelter’s power contract on december 31 2005 as a competitivelypriced replacement power supply could not be obtained alcoa continues efforts to find an alternative power source for eastalco 

australia – electricity 

power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a longterm mineral lease held by aofa and that power currently provides approximately 40 of the electricity for the company’s smelter in point henry victoria the state electricity commission of victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the portland smelter under contracts with aofa that extend to 2014 and 2016 respectively 

brazil – electricity 

the alumar smelter is supplied by eletronorte centrais elétricas do norte do brasil sa through a longterm power purchase agreement expiring in june 2024 eletronorte has supplied the alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984 

  

aluminio participates in a consortium that owns the machadinho hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil which began to generate power at full capacity in 2002 aluminio receives its share of the plant’s output which is sufficient to cover 55 of its operating needs at the poços de caldas smelter in january 2007 aluminio exercised preemptive rights to acquire an additional ownership interest of 467 in machadinho this additional investment provides an additional 15 megawatts of assured energy this transaction was approved by the brazilian energy agency antitrust regulators and other third parties in september 2007 aluminio’s ownership interest of 3189 was reduced by 09 due to the admission of a new investor to the machadinho consortium 

aluminio also has a 4218 interest in energética barra grande sa – baesa which built the barra grande hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil barra grande began operating in november 2005 and reached full generating capacity in 2006 aluminio’s share of the project covers a substantial portion of its remaining needs at the poços de caldas smelter 

with machadinho and barra grande aluminio’s current power selfsufficiency is approximately 40 to meet a total energy demand of approximately 690 megawatts from brazilian primary plants 

aluminio is also participating in a number of other brazilian hydropower projects two of these projects have received the environmental installation license from the federal government and started construction in 2007 

 

  

 serra do facão and estreito generation of power is expected to begin in 2010 

a third project pai querê in southern brazil aluminio share is 3500 is still in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses 

if these projects are completed the power will be used in aluminio’s smelters or sold into the brazilian grid 

in december 2007 aluminio concluded the sale of its 42 participation in etau a brazilian company that holds and operates an electric transmission line in southern brazil 

europe – electricity 

the company purchases electricity for its smelters at portovesme and fusina italy in the recently deregulated market under contracts expiring in december 2009 for both locations a new law went into effect on may 14 2005 that extends through december 2010 the special tariff conditions applicable to the italian smelters that measure provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the italian government however in july 2006 the european union eu opened an ongoing investigation into whether this provision should be considered unlawful state aid which may not be compatible with european legislation it is alcoa’s understanding that the italian government’s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the decision of the eu commission ec on this matter it is possible that the ec could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to january 2006 a decision by the ec is not expected until late in 2008 on november 29 2006 alcoa filed an appeal before the european court of first instance seeking the annulment of the decision of the ec to open the investigation alleging that such decision did not follow the applicable procedural rules this appeal which may be withdrawn by alcoa at any time is expected to be resolved late in 2008 as well 

the company’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations expiring in january 2009 on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa has been operating in spain for more than nine years under a power supply 

  

structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system a decision by the ec is not expected until late 2008 if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts 

iceland – electricity 

as noted above alcoa’s new fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland began operation in 2007 central to those operations is a 40year power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company built the kárahnjúkar dam and power project and supplies competitively priced electricity to the smelter first power was supplied to the fjarðaál smelter in april 2007 and with the completion of the kárahnjúkar project in late 2007 the smelter is now ramping up to full production expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2008 

minority interests – electricity 

the smelters in ghana norway and venezuela in which alcoa has only an equity stake and is not the operational manager have made a variety of electricity purchase arrangements through their respective managing or majority partners power for the smelter in ghana is provided under an interim power rate agreement with the volta river authority the other contracts are up for renewal at various times the majority of them in the period from 2011 to 2020 

canada  us – natural gas 

in order to supply its refineries and smelters in the us and canada the company generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

australia – natural gas 

aofa holds a 20 equity interest in a consortium that bought the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia aofa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries

cautionary statements under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

forwardlooking statements 

this report and the portions of the annual report incorporated by reference herein contain and oral communications made by alcoa may contain statements that relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements include those containing such words as “anticipates” “believes” “estimates” “expects” “hopes” “targets” “should” “will” “will likely result” “forecast” “outlook” “projects” or other words of similar meaning all statements that address alcoa’s expectations or projections about the future including statements about alcoa’s strategy for growth cost reduction goals expenditures and financial results are forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements are based on alcoa’s estimates assumptions and expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results performance or achievements of alcoa to be different from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements therefore alcoa cannot guarantee that these estimates assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized alcoa disclaims any intention or obligation other than as required by law to update or revise any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in management’s discussion and analysis in the annual report the following are some of the important factors that could cause alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

  

alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in lme prices economic conditions generally and aluminum enduse markets 

the aluminum industry is highly cyclical with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences prices can be volatile alcoa uses contractual arrangements with customers as well as forward futures and options contracts to manage its exposure to the volatility of lmebased prices as market conditions warrant from time to time and is product and segment diversified however alcoa’s results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in economic or aluminum industry conditions generally or in the markets served by alcoa including the transportation building and construction distribution packaging industrial gas turbine and other markets 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts the following could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

 

      alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials 

alcoa’s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials including caustic soda calcined petroleum coke and resins and freight costs associated with transporting raw materials to refining and smelting locations in addition to energy alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

some of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future alcoa may also be subject to general country strikes or work stoppages unrelated to our business or collective bargaining agreements any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy 

alcoa has an organic growth strategy focused on its “upstream” businesses significant expansion or growth projects are in various stages of development or negotiation in several countries including australia brazil brunei greenland guinea iceland jamaica and trinidad these projects may not be completed or may be completed at higher cost than expected due to shortages of labor or materials inability to obtain energy sources at competitive rates inability to negotiate favorable contracts inability to finance the construction of projects at favorable rates of interest currency fluctuations political unrest regulatory developments and commercial risks including but not limited to adverse developments in the global supply and demand for alumina and aluminum 

  

as part of its strategy for growth alcoa has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic alliances there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met 

alcoa’s operations are exposed to business and operational risks changes in conditions and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has investments activities and expansion projects in numerous countries outside the us and in emerging markets including australia brazil canada china member countries of the european union ghana greenland guinea iceland india jamaica korea mexico norway russia suriname and vietnam changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which alcoa operates could affect its business in such countries and alcoa’s results of operations 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates could affect its revenues expenses and results of operations changes in the valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the brazilian real canadian dollar euro and australian dollar may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies while products generally are sold in us dollars 

the influence of china may negatively impact our results in the event of a slowdown in consumption 

the chinese market has become a significant source of global demand for commodities china now represents in excess of 25 percent of aluminum demand china’s demand for aluminum has more than doubled in the last five years consequently in response to its increased demand for commodities china is increasingly seeking selfsufficiency in key commodities including investments in additional developments in other countries these investments may impact future demand and supply balances and prices 

alcoa faces significant price competition from other aluminum producers and enduse markets for certain alcoa products that are highly competitive such that customers may be willing to accept substitutes for products sold by alcoa 

the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets see also “competitive conditions” above the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

further metals industry consolidation could impact our business 

the metals industry has experienced consolidation over the past several years and there may be further industry consolidation in the future although current industry consolidation has not negatively impacted our business further consolidation in the aluminum industry could possibly have negative impacts that we cannot reliably predict 

  

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period alcoa’s customers may experience delays in the launch of new products due to technical and design difficulties and if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance including deployment of companywide business process models such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode and carbothermic technology in addition to multialloy casting processes there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such environmental laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to several sites 

climate change climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may adversely impact our operations and markets 

energy is a significant input in a number of alcoa’s operations there is growing recognition that energy consumption is a contributor to global warming greenhouse effects and potentially climate change 

a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change there is also current and emerging regulation such as the mandatory renewable energy target in australia or potential carbon trading regimes that will affect energy prices alcoa will likely see changes in the margins of greenhouse gasintensive assets and energyintensive assets as a result of regulatory impacts in the countries in which the company operates these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact alcoa’s operations directly or indirectly through customers inconsistency of regulations may also change the attractiveness of the locations of some of the company’s assets assessments of the potential impact of future climate change regulation are uncertain given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which alcoa operates 

the potential physical impacts of climate change on the company’s operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the geographic circumstances these may include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels these effects may adversely impact the cost production and financial performance of alcoa’s operations 

  

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in law 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa including product liability safety and health and other claims 

alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 

alcoa’s estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality alcoa’s results of operations liquidity or shareholders’ equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance further existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites 

as previously reported since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena new york plant site under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of cercla sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb in early 2002 alcoa submitted a revised analysis of alternatives report to epa this report identified potential remedial actions related to pcb contamination of the river including additional remedial alternatives that may be required by epa it also reflected certain recent studies and investigations on the river including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report was between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes because the selection of the 2 million alternative natural recovery was considered remote the company adjusted the reserve for the grasse river in 2002 to 30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives as no single alternative could be identified as more probable than the others in june 2003 based on then recent river observations epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered the results of these additional studies submitted in a report to epa in april of 2004 suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios those evaluations were submitted to epa along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river in may 2004 epa approved alcoa’s proposed remedial options pilot study rops that includes sediment removal and capping the installation of an ice control structure and significant monitoring at the same time alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the 35 million estimated cost of the rops in addition to the 30 million previously reserved most of the construction work for the rops was completed in 2005 with monitoring proposed through 2008 the findings from the rops program and from these additional investigations will be incorporated into a revised analysis of alternatives report that is expected to be submitted in 2008 epa will use this information to develop a remedy for the river with the exception of the natural recovery remedy none of the existing alternatives in the 2002 analysis of alternatives report is more probable than the others and the results of the rops are necessary to revise the scope and estimated cost of many of the current alternatives epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time epa’s record of decision is issued which is expected in 2009 or later 

  

as previously reported representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources have asserted that alcoa and reynolds metals company reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa’s and reynolds’ operations at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal proceedings have not been instituted the company continues to actively investigate these claims the company is unable to reasonably predict an outcome or to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss

as previously reported on july 20 2006 the european commission ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff granted by italy to some energy intensive industries complies with european union state aid rules the new italian power tariff modifies the preferential tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 and extends it through 2010 alcoa has been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure like the new one was based on italian state legislation that provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the italian government the ec’s announcement states that it has doubts about the measure’s compatibility with european union legislation and concerns about distortion of competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs the opening of an indepth investigation gives interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed measures it does not prejudge the outcome of the procedure it is alcoa’s understanding that the italian government’s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations alcoa believes that the total potential impact from a loss of the tariff would be approximately 20 million pretax per month in higher power costs at its italian smelters the estimated total potential impact has increased since 2006 due predominantly to the weakening of the us dollar as the liability would be payable in euros in the event of a negative outcome while alcoa believes that any additional 

  

cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the ec’s decision on this matter it is possible that the ec could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to january 2006 if the ec’s investigation concludes that extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff is unlawful alcoa will follow through with the appeal it filed before the court of first instance in luxembourg in november of 2006 in response to the investigation

as previously reported on january 25 2007 the ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether the regulated electricity tariffs granted by spain comply with eu state aid rules alcoa has been operating in spain for more than nine years under a power supply structure approved by the spanish government in 1986 an equivalent tariff having been granted in 1983 the investigation is limited to the year 2005 and it is focused both on the energyintensive consumers and the distribution companies the investigation provided 30 days to any interested party to submit observations and comments to the ec with respect to the energyintensive consumers the ec is opening the investigation on the assumption that prices paid under the tariff in 2005 were lower than the pool price mechanism therefore being in principle artificially below market conditions alcoa has submitted comments in which the company has provided evidence that prices paid by energyintensive consumers were in line with the market in addition to various legal arguments defending the legality of the spanish tariff system therefore it is alcoa’s understanding that the spanish tariff system for electricity is in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations and therefore no state aid is present in that tariff system while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed for the year 2005 it is possible that the ec could extend its investigation to later years alcoa believes that the total potential impact from an unfavorable decision would be approximately 11 million pretax for 2005 if the ec’s investigation concludes that the regulated electricity tariffs for industries are unlawful alcoa will have an opportunity to challenge the decision in the eu courts

in february 2006 alcoa signed an agreement in principle with the government of the republic of trinidad and tobago to build a 341000 mtpy aluminum smelter in the capdeville area in southwestern trinidad this agreement followed the signing of an mou in may 2004 for participation by alcoa in the development of an aluminum industry in trinidad and tobago in december 2006 the government advised alcoa of its intention to relocate the smelter the parties are working on the selection of a new site and will resume negotiations later in 2007 

in march 2006 aluminio completed a 30 expansion of the capacity of its share of the são luís alumar aluminum smelter increasing aluminio’s share of smelting capacity there by 62000 mtpy to a total of 263000 mtpy and aluminio’s share of smelter output from 5366 to 60 

alcoa and the government of iceland have begun detailed feasibility studies for the development of a 250000 mtpy aluminum smelter at bakki near húsavík in north iceland additionally separate mou agreements between alcoa and landvirkjun and alcoa and landsnet covering development of power generation and transmission for this smelter project were signed in may 2006 if the feasibility studies prove the viability of the proposed smelter it is expected that ground would not be broken before 2010 

during 2006 alcoa continued construction on its new 344000 mtpy fjarðaál aluminum smelter in east iceland alcoa broke ground on the new smelter in july 2004 the smelter is scheduled to begin production during the second quarter of 2007 

in 2006 alcoa continued construction of a new anode plant in mosjøen norway the facility being built together with elkem as will produce anodes for alcoa’s fjarðaál iceland and elkem aluminium ans’ mosjøen norway smelters construction of the anode plant remains on schedule with completion expected in 2007 

alcoa owns interests in the following primary aluminum facilities that are accounted for on the equity or cost basis method the capacity associated with these facilities is not included in alcoa’s consolidated capacity 

 

  

   

 as noted in the alumina refining facilities and capacity section above in january 2005 alcoa and the government of the republic of ghana signed an mou under which the parties would evaluate the development of an integrated aluminum industry in ghana including aluminum production the parties expect to continue discussions during 2007 regarding the feasibility of the project 

at the end of 2005 the shareholders of hamburger aluminiumwerk closed the 132000 mtpy hamburg germany smelter due to escalating power costs effective december 1 2006 alcoa austria metall ag and norsk hydro each sold their 3333 ownership interest to trimet aluminium ag 

energy 

alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power electric power accounts for approximately 30 of the company’s primary aluminum costs alcoa generates approximately 24 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and the longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters 

north america – electricity 

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 25 of the power requirements for alcoa’s north american smelters the company generally purchases the remainder under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates two hydroelectric projects tapoco and yadkin consisting of eight dams under federal energy regulatory commission ferc licenses apgi hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at alcoa tennessee and badin north carolina apgi received a renewed 40year ferc license for the tapoco project in 2005 the relicensing process is well underway for the yadkin hydroelectric project license that is up for renewal in 2008 with the badin smelter idled power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing inc and then sold into the market the tennessee smelter also purchases power from the tennessee valley authority under a contract that extends to 2010 

in the pacific northwest alcoa has a contract with chelan county public utility district located in the state of washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the wenatchee smelter through october 2011 in addition alcoa has a contract through september 2011 with the bonneville power administration bpa under which alcoa is receiving financial benefits to reduce the cost of power purchased from the market to partially operate the intalco smelter 

the company through apgi generates substantially all of the power used at its warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves in may 2005 alcoa acquired mining rights to the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves the mine became fully operational in late 2006 the mine is capable of producing approximately one million tons of coal per year 45 of the warrick power plant’s requirements the balance of the coal used is purchased principally from local illinois basin coal producers pursuant to term contracts of varying duration in april 2001 under the terms of an operating agreement the company assumed operation of the power plant that supplies the warrick smelter from vectren formerly southern indiana gas  electric company until at least 2008 in july 2005 alcoa announced its plans to invest approximately 330 million at the warrick power plant to improve environmental performance operational efficiency and lower costs this project is well underway 

power for the rockdale smelter has historically been generated by companyowned generating units and txu generation company lp txuowned generating units both of which used lignite supplied by the company’s 

  

sandow mine the company has opened a new lignite mine the three oaks mine on adjacent land it owns or controls mining in the sandow mine ceased in 2005 and the fuel supply for the companyowned and txuowned units has transitioned from the sandow mine to the three oaks mine the three companyowned generating units supplied about onehalf of the total electricity requirements of the smelter but were retired from operation in december 2006 txu currently supplies the smelter with required electricity through a longterm power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038 with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price in late 2006 txu and alcoa signed definitive agreements subject to a number of conditions precedent under which txu would construct own and operate a new circulating fluidized bed power plant adjacent to the existing sandow unit four power plant alcoa would supply lignite for the new unit from the three oaks mine and would purchase a portion of the plant’s electricity output alcoa and txu have agreed to interim power arrangements to meet the rockdale smelter’s requirements while the new generation unit is being developed 

in the northeast the purchased power contracts for both the massena east and massena west smelters in new york expire not earlier than june 30 2013 following their extension in 2003 for 10 years upon new york power authority nypa having relicensed its st lawrencefdr hydro project the company is currently in discussions with nypa to extend the power supply arrangements in order to facilitate potential technical improvements in the plants but may terminate either of these contracts with one year’s notice 

the deschambault and bécancour smelters located in quebec purchase electricity under longterm contracts with hydroquebec that expire in 2014 subject to extension provisions the smelter located in baie comeau quebec purchases approximately 65 of its power needs under the hydroquebec contract and receives the remainder of its power needs from a 40owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power company 

the mt holly smelter in south carolina purchases electricity from santee cooper under a contract that expires december 31 2015 subject to certain extension provisions 

at the end of 2005 all production was temporarily curtailed at the eastalco smelter located in frederick maryland the curtailment coincided with the expiration of the smelter’s power contract on december 31 2005 as a competitivelypriced replacement power supply could not be obtained alcoa continues efforts to find an alternative power source for eastalco 

australia – electricity 

power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a longterm mineral lease held by aofa and that power currently provides approximately 40 of the electricity for the company’s smelter in point henry victoria the state electricity commission of victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the portland smelter under contracts with aofa that extend to 2014 and 2016 respectively 

brazil – electricity 

the alumar smelter is supplied by eletronorte centrais elétricas do norte do brasil sa through a long term power purchase agreement signed in june 2004 and expiring in june 2024 eletronorte has supplied the alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984 

aluminio participates in a consortium that owns the machadinho hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil which began to generate power at full capacity in 2002 aluminio’s investment participation in this project is 2723 aluminio receives its share of the plant’s output which is sufficient to cover 51 of its operating needs at the poços de caldas smelter 

aluminio also has a 4218 interest in energética barra grande sa – baesa which built the barra grande hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil barra grande began operating in november 2005 and reached full 

  

generating capacity in 2006 aluminio’s share of the project covers a substantial portion of its currentlypurchased needs at the poços de caldas smelter 

with machadinho and barra grande aluminio’s current power selfsufficiency is approximately 38 to meet a total energy demand of approximately 690 megawatts from brazilian primary plants 

aluminio is also participating in a number of brazilian hydropower projects two of these projects have received the environmental installation license from the federal government 

 

  in january 2007 a shareholder agreement was concluded by investors in the serra do facão hydroelectric plant which formalized the creation of a company romania to construct the power plant generation of power is expected to begin in 2010 

a third project pai querê in southern brazil aluminio share is 3500 is still in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses 

if these projects are completed the power will be used in aluminio’s smelters or sold into the brazilian grid 

aluminio also owns 42 of etau a brazilian company that holds and operates an electric transmission line in southern brazil optimizing the transportation of the energy generated in the barra grande hydroelectric power plant 

europe – electricity 

the company purchases electricity for its italian smelters in the recently deregulated market under contracts expiring in december 2009 for both the portovesme and fusina smelters a new law went into effect on may 14 2005 extending through december 2010 the special tariff conditions applicable to the italian smelters this provision has been communicated by the italian government to the european union eu as a nonstateaid measure however the eu has opened an ongoing investigation into whether this provision should be considered unlawful state aid it is expected that the outcome of the investigation by the eu commission be known by the end of the second quarter of 2007 if the investigation concludes that the extension of special conditions applicable to the smelters is unlawful alcoa will follow through with the appeal it filed before the court of first instance in luxembourg in november of 2006 in response to the investigation 

the company’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations expiring in january 2010 

iceland – electricity 

as noted above alcoa broke ground in 2004 on construction of its new fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland central to those arrangements is a 40year power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company will build the kárahnjukár dam and power project and supply competitively priced electricity to the smelter 

minority interests – electricity 

the smelters in ghana norway and venezuela in which alcoa has only an equity stake and is not the operational manager have made a variety of electricity purchase arrangements through their respective managing or majority partners the power contract for the smelter in germany in which the company previously held minority interest ran through december 2005 at the end of 2005 the shareholders closed the smelter due to escalating power costs power for the smelter in ghana is provided under an interim power rate agreement with the volta river authority the other contracts are up for renewal at various times the majority of them in the period from 2011 to 2020 

  

canada  us – natural gas 

in order to supply its refineries and smelters in the us and canada the company generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

australia – natural gas 

aofa holds a 20 equity interest in a consortium that bought the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the northwest gas fields to alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia aofa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries

uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results performance or achievements of alcoa to be different from those expressed or implied in the forwardlooking statements therefore alcoa cannot guarantee that these estimates assumptions and expectations are accurate or will be realized alcoa disclaims any intention or obligation other than as required by law to update or revise any forwardlooking statements 




 item 1a risk factors 

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in management’s discussion and analysis in the annual report the following are some of the important factors that could cause alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in lme prices economic conditions generally and aluminum enduse markets 

alcoa is the world’s leading producer of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina the aluminum industry is highly cyclical with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences prices can be volatile although alcoa uses contractual arrangements with customers as well as forward futures and options contracts to manage its exposure to the volatility of lmebased prices and is product and segment diversified alcoa’s results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in economic or aluminum industry conditions generally or in the markets served by alcoa including the transportation building and construction distribution packaging industrial gas turbine and other markets 

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts the following could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

 

     alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials 

alcoa’s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials including caustic soda calcined petroleum coke and resins in addition to energy alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

some of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future any such work stoppages or potential work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy 

alcoa has an organic growth strategy focused on its “upstream” businesses significant expansion projects are in various stages of development or negotiation in australia brazil ghana guinea iceland jamaica and trinidad these projects may not be completed or may be completed at higher cost than expected due to shortages of labor or materials inability to obtain energy sources at competitive rates inability to negotiate favorable contracts inability to finance the construction of projects at favorable rates of interest currency fluctuations political unrest regulatory developments and commercial risks including but not limited to adverse developments in the global supply and demand for alumina and aluminum 

as part of its strategy for growth alcoa has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic alliances there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met 

alcoa’s operations are exposed to business and operational risks changes in conditions and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

alcoa has investments activities and expansion projects in numerous countries outside the us and in emerging markets including australia brazil china ghana guinea iceland india jamaica korea mexico norway russia suriname trinidad and vietnam changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which alcoa operates could affect its business in such countries and alcoa’s results of operations 

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates could affect its revenues expenses and results of operations in particular lower valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the canadian dollar euro and australian dollar may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies while products generally are sold in us dollars 

alcoa faces significant price competition from other aluminum producers and enduse markets for certain alcoa products that are highly competitive such that customers may be willing to accept substitutes for products sold by alcoa 

the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets see also “competitive conditions” above the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

  

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance including deployment of companywide business process models such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives 

alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode technology there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

alcoa is subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws 

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such environmental laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to several sites climate change agreements in several parts of the world may result in emission restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in law 

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa including product liability safety and health and other claims 

alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 

alcoa’s estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality alcoa’s results of operations liquidity or shareholders’ equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions 

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance 

the above list of important factors is not allinclusive or necessarily in order of importance

 alcoa’s corporate center is located at 201 isabella street pittsburgh pennsylvania 152125858 alcoa’s principal office is located at 390 park avenue new york new york 100224608 

alcoa leases some of its facilities however it is the opinion of management that the leases do not materially affect the continued use of the properties or their values 

alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations although no title examination of properties owned by alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties see notes h and u to the financial statements for information on properties plants and equipment and lease expense 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

environmental matters 

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites 

as previously reported since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena new york plant site under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of cercla sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl 

  

pcb in early 2002 alcoa submitted a revised analysis of alternatives report to epa this report identified potential remedial actions related to pcb contamination of the river including additional remedial alternatives that may be required by epa it also reflected certain recent studies and investigations on the river including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report was between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes because the selection of the 2 million alternative natural recovery was considered remote the company adjusted the reserve for the grasse river in 2002 to 30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives as no single alternative could be identified as more probable than the others in june 2003 based on then recent river observations epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered the results of these additional studies submitted in a report to epa in april of 2004 suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios those evaluations were submitted to epa along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river in may 2004 epa approved alcoa’s proposed remedial options pilot study rops that includes sediment removal and capping the installation of an ice control structure and significant monitoring at the same time alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the 35 million estimated cost of the rops in addition to the 30 million previously reserved most of the construction work for the rops was completed in 2005 with monitoring proposed for 2006 continuing through 2008 the reserves for the grasse river were routinely reevaluated in 2006 and an adjustment of 41 million was made to cover commitments made to epa for additional investigation work for the ongoing monitoring program including that associated with the rops program and for an interim measure that involves annually the mechanical ice breaking of the river to prevent the formation of ice jams until a permanent remedy is selected the findings from the rops program and from these additional investigations will be incorporated into a revised analysis of alternatives report that is expected to be submitted in 2008 epa will use this information to develop a remedy for the river with the exception of the natural recovery remedy none of the existing alternatives in the 2002 analysis of alternatives report is more probable than the others and the results of the rops are necessary to revise the scope and estimated cost of many of the current alternatives epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time epa’s record of decision is issued which is expected in 2008 or later 

representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources have asserted that alcoa and reynolds metals company “reynolds” may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa’s and reynolds’ operations at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal proceedings have not been instituted the company continues to actively investigate these claims 

as previously reported in september 1998 hurricane georges struck the us virgin islands including the st croix alumina llc facility on the island of st croix the wind and rain associated with the hurricane caused material at the location to be blown into neighboring residential areas various cleanup and remediation efforts were undertaken by or on behalf of st croix alumina llc a notice of violation was issued by the division of environmental protection of the department of planning and natural resources of the virgin islands government and has been contested by the company a civil suit was commenced in the territorial court of the virgin islands by certain residents of st croix in february 1999 seeking compensatory and punitive damages and injunctive relief for alleged personal injuries and property damages associated with “bauxite or red dust” from the st croix alumina llc facility the suit which has been removed to the district court of the virgin islands names st croix alumina llc alcoa inc and glencore ltd as defendants and in august 2000 was accorded class action treatment the class is defined to include persons in various defined neighborhoods who “suffered damages andor injuries as a result of exposure during and after hurricane georges to red dust and red mud blown during hurricane georges” all of the defendants have denied liability and discovery and other pretrial proceedings have been underway since 1999 in october 2003 the defendants received plaintiffs’ expert reports these reports also claim that the material blown during hurricane georges consisted of bauxite and red mud and contained crystalline silica chromium and other substances the reports go on to claim among other things that the population of the six subject neighborhoods as of the 2000 census a total of 3730 people has been exposed to toxic substances through the fault of the defendants and hence will be able to show entitlement to 

  

lifetime medical monitoring as well as other compensatory and punitive relief these opinions have been contested by the defendants’ expert reports that state among other things that plaintiffs were not exposed to the substances alleged and that in any event the level of alleged exposure does not justify lifetime medical monitoring in august 2005 alcoa and st croix alumina llc moved to decertify the plaintiff class and in march 2006 the assigned magistrate judge issued a recommendation that class certification be maintained for liability issues only and that the class be decertified after liability issues have been resolved this recommendation has been adopted by the assigned district judge alcoa and st croix alumina llc have turned over this matter to their insurance carriers who are providing a defense glencore ltd is jointly defending the case with alcoa and st croix alumina llc and has a pending motion to dismiss

as previously reported in the 2006 second quarter alcoa aluminio sa alcoa aluminio received a notice of violation and fine from brazil’s federal revenue department seeking payment of an isolated fine for alleged nonanticipation of payment of annual corporate income ci and social contribution taxes sct calculated under the presumed monthly taxable income mechanism the claim is based on alcoa aluminio not qualifying for the alternative method of anticipation of payment of ci and sct used by the company consisting of calculating such anticipations based on the actual taxable income mechanism in accordance with applicable legislation the claim seeks payment of brazilian real 669 million equivalent to approximately us304 million and encompasses fiscal years from 2000 to 2005 alcoa aluminio believes that the claim is without merit and will present its defenses at all appropriate levels – administrative or judicial – of the brazilian legal system on september 4 2006 a favorable first administrative level decision was rendered finding the claim against alcoa aluminio to be without merit the next administrative level is presently reviewing the case 

as previously reported on july 20 2006 the european commission ec announced that it has opened an investigation to establish whether an extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff granted by italy to some energy intensive industries complies with european union state aid rules the new italian power tariff modifies the preferential tariff that was in force until december 31 2005 and extends it through 2010 alcoa has been operating in italy for more than 10 years under a power supply structure approved by the ec in 1996 that measure like the new 

  

one was based on italian state legislation that provides a competitive power supply to the primary aluminum industry and is not considered state aid by the italian government the ec’s announcement states that it has doubts about the measure’s compatibility with european union legislation and concerns about distortion of competition in the european market of primary aluminum where energy is an important part of the production costs the opening of an indepth investigation gives interested parties the opportunity to comment on the proposed measures it does not prejudge the outcome of the procedure it is alcoa’s understanding that the italian government’s continuation of the electricity tariff was done in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations alcoa believes that the total potential impact from a loss of the tariff would be approximately 17 million pretax per month in higher power costs at its italian smelters while alcoa believes that any additional cost would only be assessed prospectively from the date of the ec’s decision on this matter it is possible that the ec could rule that the assessment must be retroactively applied to january 2006 if the ec’s investigation concludes that extension of the regulated preferential electricity tariff is unlawful alcoa will follow through with the appeal it filed before the court of first instance in luxembourg in november of 2006 in response to the investigation 

on november 17 2006 a suit was filed by charles curtis and others against alcoa individually and as fiduciary of the employee’s group benefits plan of alcoa plan ii in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee the suit was filed on behalf of more than 2000 postmay 31 1993 retirees alleging that the company’s implementation of a financial liability cap for retiree medical benefits is in violation of their right to lifetime vested retiree medical benefits at no cost the company is vigorously defending against the action prior to june 1 1993 united steelworker retirees received medical benefits at no cost in 1993 alcoa reynolds and the united steelworkers union agreed that the company would limit its financial liability for providing retiree medical benefits for employees who retired after may 31 1993 this limitation was based on the company’s per capita cost of providing the benefit during the final year of the collective bargaining agreement as a result of the capped liability post may 31 1993 retirees were expected to begin to pay a portion of their retiree medical benefits after the expiration of the bargaining agreement the company’s limitation was increased during 1996 negotiations as well as 2001 negotiations so that post may 31 1993 retirees continued to receive benefits at no cost bargaining unit employees and retirees were aware of the limitation through bargaining agreement side letters andor summary plan description communications during the may 2006 negotiations the parties agreed to implement the company’s financial limitation beginning january 1 2007 and retirees would begin to pay monthly premiums deductibles and copayments for their alcoa provided medical coverage

in february 2006 alcoa signed an agreement in principle with the government of the republic of trinidad and tobago to build a 341000 mtpy aluminum smelter in the capdeville area in southwestern trinidad this agreement follows the signing of an mou in may 2004 for participation by alcoa in the development of an aluminum industry in trinidad and tobago under the agreement in principle alcoa will take a lead role in the development and operation of the smelter with the government installing necessary infrastructure alcoa will also sponsor development of a new power station to support the facility negotiations are ongoing for the final commercial arrangements which will be subject to final approvals by alcoa’s board of directors and by the government 

  

during 2005 aluminio began a 30 expansion of the capacity of its share of the são luís alumar aluminum smelter increasing aluminio’s share of smelting capacity there by 62000 mtpy to a total of 263000 mtpy when complete alcoa’s share of output from the smelter will grow from 5366 to 60 completion of the expansion and startup of the additional capacity is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2006 

  

as noted above in september 2005 alcoa announced that its board of directors approved plans to make further investments totaling 16 billion in the company’s brazilian upstream operations including the modernization of the poços de caldas aluminum smelter in the state of minas gerais the modernization is aimed at reducing emissions and costs and improving operational efficiency 

  

during 2005 alcoa continued construction on its new 346000 mtpy fjarðaál aluminum smelter in east iceland alcoa broke ground on the new smelter in july 2004 the smelter is scheduled to begin production in april 2007 

  

alcoa has a joint action plan in place with the government of iceland and three communities in northern iceland to evaluate the construction of an up to 250000 mtpy smelter through the fall of 2005 three sites have been evaluated and a conclusion on whether to proceed further is expected by march 2006 an mou covering further development of this smelter project based on a selected site is expected 

  

in 2005 alcoa continued construction of a new anode plant in mosjøen norway the facility being built together with elkem as will produce anodes for alcoa’s fjarðaál iceland and elkem aluminium ans’ mosjøen norway smelters construction of the anode plant is expected to be completed by 2007 

  

alcoa is exploring aluminum smelting and associated hydroelectric power opportunities in suriname in january 2003 suralco one of the awac group of companies signed an mou with the government of suriname providing for an initial 18month exclusive period of investigation of the feasibility of smelting and associated hydroelectric power investment in western suriname in december 2004 the parties agreed retroactively to extend the mou through december 31 2005 alcoa is in the process of negotiating a follow on agreement with the government 

  

alcoa has an exclusive mou in effect with the brunei economic development board bedb for building a smelter in brunei in november 2005 the bedb received a mckinsey report evaluating the use of brunei’s gas reserves for downstream industry the potential smelter is one of several industrial developments being considered by the bedb 

  

alcoa owns interests in the following primary aluminum facilities that are accounted for on the equity or cost basis method the capacity associated with these facilities is not included in alcoa’s consolidated capacity 

  

     

as noted above in january 2005 alcoa and the government of the republic of ghana signed an mou under which the parties would evaluate the development of an integrated aluminum industry in ghana including aluminum production alcoa is working with the government to conduct feasibility studies for the project these studies are expected to be completed in 2006 at which time the parties would negotiate definitive agreements on smelting and other matters 

  

at the end of 2005 the shareholders of hamburger aluminiumwerk closed the 132000 mtpy hamburg germany smelter due to escalating power costs the hamburg smelter is owned 3333 each by alcoa austria metall ag and norsk hydro 

  

energy 

  

alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power electric power accounts for approximately 25 of the company’s primary aluminum costs alcoa generates approximately 24 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters 

  

north america  electricity 

  

the company’s whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 25 of the power requirements for alcoa’s north american smelters the company generally purchases the remainder under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates two hydroelectric projects tapoco and yadkin consisting of eight dams under federal energy regulatory commission ferc licenses apgi hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at alcoa tennessee and badin north 

  

carolina apgi received a renewed 40year ferc license for the tapoco project in 2005 and the yadkin hydroelectric project license is up for renewal in 2008 with the badin smelter idled power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold to an affiliate alcoa power marketing inc the tennessee smelter also purchases power from the tennessee valley authority under a contract that extends to 2010 

  

in the pacific northwest alcoa has a contract with chelan county public utility district located in the state of washington that is sufficient to supply about half of the capacity of the wenatchee smelter through october 2011 in addition alcoa has a contract through september 2006 for a limited amount of power from the bonneville power administration bpa that can be used to cover the remainder of the capacity at the wenatchee smelter or to operate the intalco smelter alcoa is currently returning part of its bpa power through the end of the contract period bpa has embarked on the contracting process for the period october 2006september 2011 but it is not yet clear whether the bpa offer will be adequate for intalco andor wenatchee operations 

  

the company through apgi generates substantially all of the power used at its warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves a 1996 coal supply contract satisfies up to 70 of the fuel requirements of the warrick power plant supplying the smelter through june 2006 in may 2005 alcoa acquired mining rights to the nearby friendsville illinois coal reserves and it expects coal from this mine to be available for its use by the summer of 2006 when fully operational the mine will be capable of producing approximately 1 million tons of coal per year approximately 45 of the warrick power plant’s requirements in april 2001 under the terms of an operating agreement the company assumed operation of the power plant that supplies the warrick smelter from vectren formerly southern indiana gas  electric company until at least 2008 in july 2005 alcoa announced its plans to invest approximately 330 million at the warrick power plant to improve environmental performance and operational efficiency and lower costs 

  

power for the rockdale smelter is generated by companyowned generating units and txu generation company lp txuowned generating units historically both the companyowned and the txuowned units used lignite supplied by the company’s sandow mine the company has opened a new lignite mine the three oaks mine on adjacent land it owns or controls the fuel supply for the companyowned and txuowned units is transitioning from the sandow mine to the three oaks mine with active mining in sandow expected to conclude in 2006 companyowned generating units supply about onehalf of the total electricity requirements of the smelter although this capacity will retire not later than 2007 txu supplies the balance through a longterm power contract that does not expire until at least the end of 2038 with the parties having the right to terminate the contract after 2013 if there has been an unfavorable change in law or after 2025 if the cost of the electricity exceeds the market price txu and alcoa recently signed a letter of intent in connection with the possible development of a new circulating fluidized bed power plant adjacent to the existing sandow unit four power plant alcoa would supply lignite for the new unit from the three oaks mine and have a right to purchase a portion of the plant’s electricity output 

  

in the northeast the purchased power contracts for both the massena east and massena west smelters in new york expire not earlier than june 30 2013 following their extension for 10 years upon new york power authority nypa having relicensed its st lawrencefdr hydro project the company is currently in discussions with nypa to extend the power supply arrangements in order to facilitate potential technical improvements in the plants but may terminate either of these contracts with one year’s notice 

  

the deschambault and bécancour smelters located in quebec purchase electricity under longterm contracts with hydroquebec that expire in 2014 subject to extension provisions the smelter located in baie comeau quebec purchases approximately 65 of its power needs under the hydroquebec contract and receives the remainder of its power needs from a 40owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power company 

  

the mt holly smelter in south carolina purchases electricity from santee cooper under a contract that expires december 31 2015 subject to certain extension provisions 

  

at the end of 2005 all production was temporarily curtailed at the eastalco smelter located in frederick maryland the curtailment coincides with the expiration of the smelter’s power contract on december 31 2005 as a competitivelypriced replacement power supply could not be obtained 

  

australia  electricity 

  

power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a longterm mineral lease held by aofa and that power currently provides approximately 40 of the electricity for the company’s smelter in point henry victoria the state electricity commission of victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the portland smelter under contracts with aofa that extend to 2014 and 2016 respectively 

  

brazil  electricity 

  

the alumar smelter is supplied by eletronorte centrais elétricas do norte do brasil sa through a longterm power purchase agreement signed in june 2004 and expiring in june 2024 eletronorte has supplied the alumar smelter from the beginning of its operations in 1984 

  

aluminio participates in a consortium that owns the machadinho hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil which began to generate power at full capacity in 2002 aluminio receives its share of the plant’s output which is sufficient to cover 51 of its operating needs at the poços de caldas smelter 

  

aluminio also has a 42 interest in energética barra grande sa – baesa which built the barra grande hydroelectric power plant in southern brazil barra grande began operating in november 2005 and is expected to reach full generating capacity in 2006 aluminio’s share of the project will cover a substantial portion of its currentlypurchased needs at the poços de caldas smelter 

  

aluminio is also participating in a number of brazilian hydropower projects in general the projects have been approved by the federal government and they are in the process of obtaining necessary environmental licenses 

  

   

   

   

if these projects are completed the power will be used in aluminio’s smelters or sold into the brazilian grid 

  

aluminio also owns 42 of etau a brazilian company that holds and operates an electric transmission line in southern brazil optimizing the transportation of the energy generated in the barra grande hydroelectric power plant 

  

europe  electricity 

  

the company purchases electricity for its italian smelters in the deregulated market under contracts expiring in december 2009 for both the portovesme and fusina smelters a new law went into effect on may 14 2005 extending through december 2010 the special conditions applicable to the italian smelters this provision has been communicated by the italian government to the european union eu as a nonstateaid measure and eu assent is expected in the first half of 2006 

  

the company’s smelters at san ciprián la coruña and avilés spain purchase electricity from the power grid at the lowest applicable industrial tariff rate under regulations expiring in january 2010 

  

iceland  electricity 

  

as noted above alcoa broke ground in 2004 on construction of its new fjarðaál smelter in eastern iceland central to those arrangements is a 40year power contract under which landsvirkjun the icelandic national power company will build the karahnjukar dam and power project and supply competitively priced electricity to the smelter

the smelters in germany ghana norway and venezuela in which alcoa has only an equity stake and is not the operational manager have made a variety of electricity purchase arrangements through their respective managing or majority partners the power contract for germany ran through december 2005 at the end of 2005 the shareholders closed the smelter due to escalating power costs power for the smelter in ghana is provided under an interim power rate agreement with the volta river authority the other contracts are up for renewal at various times the majority of them in the period from 2011 to 2020 

  

canada  us  natural gas 

  

in order to supply its refineries and smelters in the us and canada the company generally procures natural gas on a competitive bid basis from a variety of sources including producers in the gas production areas and independent gas marketers for alcoa’s larger consuming locations in canada and the us the gas commodity as well as interstate pipeline transportation is procured to provide increased flexibility and reliability contract pricing for gas is typically based on a published industry index or new york mercantile exchange nymex price the company may choose to reduce its exposure to nymex pricing by hedging a portion of required natural gas consumption 

  

australia  natural gas 

  

aofa holds a 20 equity interest in a consortium which bought the dampiertobunbury natural gas pipeline in october 2004 this pipeline transports gas from the north west gas fields to alcoa’s alumina refineries and other users in the southwest of western australia aofa uses gas to cogenerate steam and electricity for its alumina refining processes at the kwinana pinjarra and wagerup refineries

 item 1a risk factors 

  

in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report and in management’s discussion and analysis in the annual report the following are some of the important factors that could cause alcoa’s actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forwardlooking statements 

  

alcoa is subject to cyclical fluctuations in lme prices economic conditions generally and aluminum enduse markets 

  

alcoa is the world’s leading producer of primary aluminum fabricated aluminum and alumina the aluminum industry is highly cyclical with prices subject to worldwide market forces of supply and demand and other influences prices can be volatile although alcoa uses contractual arrangements with customers as well as forward futures and options contracts to manage its exposure to the volatility of lmebased prices and is product and segment diversified alcoa’s results of operations could be affected by material adverse changes in economic or aluminum industry conditions generally or in the markets served by alcoa including the transportation building and construction distribution packaging industrial gas turbine and other markets 

  

alcoa’s operations consume substantial amounts of energy profitability may decline if energy costs rise or if energy supplies are interrupted 

  

alcoa consumes substantial amounts of energy in its operations although alcoa generally expects to meet the energy requirements for its alumina refineries and primary aluminum smelters from internal sources or from longterm contracts the following could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

  

   

   

   

   

   

alcoa’s profitability could be adversely affected by increases in the cost of raw materials 

  

alcoa’s results of operations will be affected by increases in the cost of raw materials including caustic soda calcined petroleum coke and resins in addition to energy alcoa may not be able to offset fully the effects of higher raw material costs or energy costs through price increases productivity improvements or cost reduction programs 

  

union disputes and other employee relations issues could adversely affect alcoa’s financial results 

  

some of alcoa’s employees are represented by labor unions in a number of countries under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates at the end of may 2006 the master labor agreement between alcoa and the usw covering 15 locations in the united states and about 9000 employees is scheduled to expire alcoa may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate this or other collective bargaining agreements in the united states and other countries when they expire in addition existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at alcoa’s facilities in the future any such work stoppages could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

  

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its growth strategy 

  

alcoa has an organic growth strategy focused on its “upstream” businesses significant expansion projects are in various stages of development or negotiation in australia brazil ghana guinea iceland jamaica suriname and trinidad these projects may not be completed or may be completed at higher cost than expected due to shortages of labor or materials inability to obtain energy sources at competitive rates inability to negotiate favorable contracts inability to finance the construction of projects at favorable rates of interest political unrest regulatory developments and commercial risks including but not limited to adverse developments in the global supply and demand for alumina and aluminum 

  

as part of its strategy for growth alcoa has made and may continue to make acquisitions and divestitures and form strategic alliances there can be no assurance that these will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that targeted completion dates will be met 

  

alcoa’s operations are exposed to business and operational risks changes in conditions and events beyond its control in the countries in which it operates 

  

alcoa has investments activities and expansion projects in numerous countries outside the us and in emerging markets including australia brazil china ghana guinea iceland india jamaica korea mexico russia suriname and trinidad changes in the laws or governmental policies in the countries in which alcoa operates could affect its business in such countries and alcoa’s results of operations 

  

alcoa is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as well as inflation and other economic factors in the countries in which it operates 

  

economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and competitive factors in the countries in which alcoa operates could affect its revenues expenses and results of operations in particular lower valuation of the us dollar against other currencies particularly the canadian dollar euro and australian dollar may affect profitability as some important raw materials are purchased in other currencies while products generally are sold in us dollars 

  

alcoa faces significant price competition from other aluminum producers and enduse markets for certain alcoa products that are highly competitive such that customers may be willing to accept substitutes for products sold by alcoa 

  

the markets for most aluminum products are highly competitive in addition aluminum competes with other materials such as steel plastics composites and glass among others for various applications in alcoa’s key markets see also “competitive conditions” above the willingness of customers to accept substitutions for the products sold by alcoa the ability of large customers to exert leverage in the marketplace to affect the pricing for fabricated aluminum products or other developments by or affecting alcoa’s competitors or customers could affect alcoa’s results of operations 

  

alcoa could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a significant customer or customers 

  

a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a key customer or customers supplied by alcoa could affect alcoa’s results of operations in a particular period if alcoa is not successful in replacing business lost from such customers profitability may be adversely affected 

  

alcoa may not be able to successfully implement its productivity and costreduction initiatives 

  

alcoa has undertaken and may continue to undertake productivity and costreduction initiatives to improve performance including deployment of companywide business process models such as the alcoa business system and the alcoa enterprise business solution an initiative designed to build a common global infrastructure across alcoa for data processes and supporting software there can be no assurance that these initiatives will be completed or beneficial to alcoa or that any estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 

  

alcoa may not be able to successfully develop and implement new technology initiatives 

  

alcoa is working on new developments in advanced smelting process technologies including inert anode technology there can be no assurance that such technologies will be commercially feasible or beneficial to alcoa 

  

alcoa is subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may be exposed to substantial costs and liabilities associated with such laws 

  

alcoa’s operations worldwide are subject to numerous complex and increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations the costs of complying with such environmental laws and regulations including participation in assessments and cleanups of sites as well as internal voluntary programs are significant and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by certain environmental matters including remediation costs and damages related to several sites climate change agreements in several parts of the world may result in emission restrictions on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases 

  

alcoa may be exposed to significant legal proceedings investigations or changes in law 

  

alcoa’s results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be affected by new or increasingly stringent laws regulatory requirements or interpretations or significant legal proceedings or investigations adverse to alcoa including product liability safety and health and other claims 

  

alcoa could be required to make additional contributions to its defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 

  

alcoa’s estimates of liabilities and expenses for pensions and other postretirement benefits incorporate significant assumptions including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability the longterm rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases medical costs retirement age and mortality alcoa’s results of operations liquidity or shareholders’ equity in a particular period could be affected by a decline in the rate of return on plan assets the rate used to discount the future estimated liability or changes in employee workforce assumptions 

  

unexpected events may increase alcoa’s cost of doing business or disrupt alcoa’s operations 

  

unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities natural disasters such as the gulf coast hurricanes in 2005 war or terrorist activities unplanned outages supply disruptions or failure of equipment or processes to meet specifications may increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact alcoa’s financial performance

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

  

environmental matters 

  

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites 

  

as previously reported since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena new york plant site under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of cercla sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb in early 2002 alcoa submitted a revised analysis of alternatives report to epa this report identified potential remedial actions related to pcb contamination of the river including additional remedial alternatives that may be required by epa it also reflected certain recent studies and investigations on the river including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report was between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes because the selection of the 2 million alternative natural recovery was considered remote the company adjusted the reserve for the grasse river in 2002 to 30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives as no single alternative could be identified as more probable than the others in june 2003 based on then recent river observations epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered the results of these additional studies submitted in a report to epa in april of 2004 suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios those evaluations were submitted to epa along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river in may 2004 epa approved alcoa’s proposed remedial options pilot study rops that includes sediment removal and capping the installation of an ice control structure and significant monitoring at the same time alcoa adjusted the reserve for the river to include the 35 million estimated cost of the rops in addition to the 30 million previously reserved most of the construction work for the rops was completed in 2005 with monitoring proposed for 2006 the findings will be incorporated into a revised analysis of alternatives report that is expected to be submitted in 2007 epa will use this information to develop a remedy for the river with the exception of the natural recovery remedy none of the existing alternatives in the 2002 analysis of alternatives report is more probable than the others and the results of the rops are necessary to revise the scope and estimated cost of many of the current alternatives epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time epa’s record of decision is issued which is expected in 2008 or later 

  

as previously reported in may through october 2002 eleven lawsuits were filed against reynolds metals company reynolds and alcoa in the district court of wharton county texas and one in the united states district court southern district of texas victoria division  the lawsuits seek to recover damages relating to the presence of trichloroethylene in the groundwater near a former reynolds extrusion facility in el campo texas three of the cases were later dismissed and all except one of the remaining cases were consolidated into a single case in the district court of wharton county texas bon l campo limited partnership and its parent tredegar corporation operators of the plant from 19972000 have also been listed among the defendants in some of the lawsuits and reynolds brought its predecessor in interest whittaker corporation into the litigation the only significant personal injury claim was settled in 2003 alcoa on behalf of itself reynolds a reynolds subsidiary bon l campo lp and tredegar has settled the claims of nearly all remaining plaintiffs whose property is affected by the groundwater including through the installation and operation of an extension of the city of el campo water system using funds provided by alcoa

alcoa’s corporate center is located at 201 isabella street pittsburgh pennsylvania 152125858 alcoa’s global office is located at 390 park avenue new york new york 100224608

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

  

environmental matters 

  

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the superfund or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites 

  

since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena new york plant site under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb in the fourth quarter of 1999 alcoa submitted an analysis of alternatives report to the epa this report identified potential courses of remedial action related to the pcb contamination of the river the epa indicated to alcoa that it believed additional remedial alternatives needed to be included in the analysis of alternatives report during 2000 and 2001 alcoa completed certain studies and investigations on the river 

  

including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies in february 2002 alcoa submitted a revised analysis of alternatives report based on these additional evaluations and included additional remedial alternatives required by the epa the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report is between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes based on the current assessment of the epa decisionmaking process the company has now concluded that the selection of the 2 million alternative based on natural recovery only is remote because the selection of the 2 million alternative was considered remote alcoa adjusted the reserve for the grasse river in 2002 to 30 million in june 2003 based on river observations during the spring of 2003 the epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup so that it could be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered the results of these additional studies submitted in a report to the epa in april of 2004 suggest that this phenomenon has the potential to occur approximately every 10 years and may impact sediments in certain portions of the river under all remedial scenarios those evaluations were submitted to epa along with a proposal to perform additional pilot remedial studies in the river in may 2004 epa approved these additional studies known as remedial options pilot studies rops most of the work for this study should be completed by the fourth quarter of 2005 it is anticipated that a report of findings will be issued to the epa in 2006 subsequent to this submittal a revised analysis of alternatives report will be submitted to epa at a date to be determined this information will be used by the epa to propose a remedy for the entire river 

  

alcoa has reserved an additional 35 million to perform the study described above in 2005 even while the reserve was adjusted to account for the rops activity once that field work is completed including capping and potentially substantial sediment removal the company is not now able to know with certainty when the epa will reach a final remedial decision nor estimate how such a decision will be valued 

  

representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources have asserted that alcoa and reynolds metals company reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa’s and reynolds’ operations at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal proceedings have not been instituted the company continues to actively investigate these claims 

  

since 1990 alcoa has undertaken investigations and evaluations concerning alleged releases of mercury from its point comfort texas facility into the adjacent lavaca bay pursuant to a superfund order from the epa in march 1994 the epa listed the “alcoa point comfortlavaca bay site” on the national priorities list and alcoa and region vi of the epa entered into an administrative order on consent epa docket no 61194 concerning the site the administrative order required the company to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study under epa oversight following submission by the company of all required information in december 2001 the epa issued its record of decision selecting the final remedial approach for the site in addition the company and certain federal and state natural resource trustees who previously served alcoa with notice of their intent to file suit to recover damages for alleged loss or injury of natural resources in lavaca bay have cooperatively identified restoration alternatives and approaches for resource injuries at the site negotiations between alcoa and the epa and other federal and state agencies responsible for remediation and natural resource damage assessment were completed and two consent decrees covering those matters respectively were concluded the consent decrees were lodged in federal district court in texas on december 10 2004 after a period for public comment the consent decrees are expected to be formally entered by the court early in 2005 the actions required by those consent decrees which are consistent with the record of decision and the identified resource restoration alternatives are fully reserved 

  

in may through october 2002 eleven lawsuits were filed against reynolds and alcoa in the district court of wharton county texas and one in the united states district court southern district of texas victoria division  the lawsuits seek to recover damages relating to the presence of trichloroethylene in the groundwater near a former reynolds extrusion facility in el campo texas three of the cases were later dismissed and all except one of the remaining cases have been consolidated into a single case in the district court of wharton county texas none of the defendants have been served in the “unconsolidated” case and 

  

there has been no activity in that case since filing bon l campo limited partnership and its parent tredegar corporation operators of the plant from 19972000 have also been listed among the defendants in some of the lawsuits and reynolds has brought its predecessor in interest whittaker corporation into the litigation several of the petitions indicate that plaintiffs will request certification of class status for other allegedly affected individuals however none of the plaintiffs have filed motions for class certification to date the only significant personal injury claim settled in 2003 alcoa on behalf of itself reynolds a reynolds subsidiary bon l campo lp and tredegar has settled with most of the plaintiffs with property within the known affected area after a number of dismissals approximately 655 plaintiffs remain unsettled motions for summary judgment are pending against these remaining plaintiffs but the court has not ruled on them no trial date has been set for these remaining claims

alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations although no title examination of properties owned by alcoa has been made for the purpose of this report the company knows of no material defects in title to any such properties see notes h and t to the financial statements for information on properties plants and equipment and lease expense 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

  

environmental matters 

  

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the superfund or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites 

  

since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena new york plant site under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb in the fourth quarter of 1999 alcoa submitted an analysis of alternatives report to the epa this report identified potential courses of remedial action related to the pcb contamination of the river the epa indicated to alcoa that it believed additional remedial alternatives needed to be included in the analysis of alternatives report during 2000 and 2001 alcoa completed certain studies and investigations on the river including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies in february 2002 alcoa submitted a final analysis of alternatives report based on these additional evaluations and included additional remedial alternatives required by the epa the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report is between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes based on the current assessment of the epa decisionmaking process the company has now concluded that the selection of the 2 million alternative based on natural recovery only is remote in june 2003 based on river observations during the spring of 2003 the epa requested that alcoa gather additional field data to assess the potential for sediment erosion from winter river ice formation and breakup alcoa has collected a significant portion of the additional data and is in the process of data analysis and determining how this phenomenon should be factored into the range of remedial alternatives being considered it is anticipated that a report of findings will be issued to the epa in the second quarter of 2004 subsequent to this submittal a revised analysis of alternatives report will be submitted at a date to be determined 

  

alcoa continues to believe that alternatives involving the largest amounts of sediment removal should not be selected for the grasse river remedy therefore the company believes that the alternatives that should reasonably be considered for selection range from engineered capping and natural recovery of 30 million to a combination of moderate dredging capping and natural recovery of 90 million accordingly alcoa has adjusted the reserve for the grasse river to 30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives as no one of the alternatives is more likely to be selected than any other the epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability however as the process allows for input that can influence the scope and cost of the remedy through the issuance of the formal record of decision rod alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the rod is issued 

  

representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources have asserted that alcoa and reynolds metals company reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa’s and reynolds’ operations at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal proceedings have not been instituted the company continues to actively investigate these claims 

  

since 1990 alcoa has undertaken investigations and evaluations concerning alleged releases of mercury from its point comfort texas facility into the adjacent lavaca bay pursuant to a superfund order from the epa in march 1994 the epa listed the “alcoa point comfortlavaca bay site” on the national priorities list and alcoa and region vi of the epa entered into an administrative order on consent epa docket no 61194 concerning the site the administrative order required the company to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study under epa oversight following submission by the company of all required information in december 2001 the epa issued its rod selecting the final remedial approach for the site which is fully reserved the company continues to negotiate a consent order with the epa under which it will undertake to implement the remedy the company and certain federal and state natural resource trustees who previously served alcoa with notice of their intent to file suit to recover damages for alleged loss or injury of natural resources in lavaca bay have cooperatively identified restoration alternatives and approaches for lavaca bay the cost of such restoration is reserved and alcoa continues to negotiate a consent decree with the trustees under which it will implement the restoration alcoa does not believe that any additional liability for this site is reasonably possible

production at primary aluminum smelters in the northwest us and in brazil was curtailed in 2001 due to energy shortages or the unavailability of energy at competitive prices in 2002 the smelters in brazil restarted all of the previously curtailed production and alcoa restarted two potlines at intalco also in 2002 alcoa temporarily curtailed production at its badin north carolina plant and permanently closed its troutdale oregon plant as well as approximately 25 of the capacity at its rockdale texas facility alcoa currently has approximately 445000 mtpy of idled smelting capacity out of a worldwide consolidated primary aluminum capacity of 3948000 mtpy 

  

in july 2002 alcoa signed an mou with the government of iceland and landsvirkjun iceland’s national power company formalizing their cooperation in the evaluation and potential development of a 320000 mtpy “fjaraál” aluminum smelter in eastern iceland the mou encompasses the development of a 500megawatt hydropower facility by landsvirkjun in eastern iceland environmental and engineering studies of the smelter by alcoa and development of harbor and port facilities and related infrastructure improvements in eastern iceland by icelandic municipalities in january 2003 alcoa’s board of directors approved plans for the construction of the smelter subject to approvals by the government of iceland and other governmental authorities the cost of the facility which would begin production in 2007 is estimated to be approximately 11 billion over the next four years 

  

alcoa also will explore the feasibility of establishing aluminum smelting and associated hydroelectric power opportunities in western suriname in january 2003 alcoa signed an mou with the government of suriname providing for an 18month exclusive period of investigation of the feasibility of smelting and associated hydroelectric power investment in western suriname under the mou alcoa has budgeted 15 million  75 million in expenditures over this period to assess the investment potential and to negotiate an investment agreement with the government 

  

in december 2002 alcoa announced that it plans to invest c1 billion over eight years for the expansion and upgrade of its baie comeau quebec aluminum smelter under an mou with the quebec government work would begin by the end of 2003 and the new facility would be 

  

operational by 2010 the quebec government has conditionally agreed to provide financial support and a guarantee of additional energy supplies upon completion the project will have increased annual production capacity from 420000 mtpy to 547000 mtpy 

  

energy 

  

alcoa produces aluminum from alumina by an electrolytic process requiring large amounts of electric power electric power accounts for approximately 25 of the company’s primary aluminum costs alcoa generates approximately 25 of the power used at its smelters worldwide and generally purchases the remainder under longterm arrangements the paragraphs below summarize the sources of power and material longterm power arrangements for alcoa’s smelters 

  

north america  electricity 

  

for its 13 north american smelters the company largely through its whollyowned subsidiary alcoa power generating inc apgi generates approximately 25 of the power requirements and generally purchases the remainder under longterm contracts apgi owns and operates two hydroelectric projects consisting of eight dams under federal energy regulatory commission licenses which are up for renewal in 2005 and 2008 

  

in the pacific northwest alcoa obtains approximately half of its power needs for its wenatchee smelter from its entitlement through 2011 to a fixed percentage of the output from chelan county public utility district’s rocky reach hydroelectric power facility located in the state of washington in addition alcoa has a contract through 2006 with the bonneville power administration bpa that serves part of the wenatchee smelter as well as the intalco smelter alcoa is currently returning its allotment of power to bpa under arrangements that end in september 2003 several contractual provisions allow power supply restrictions when power is in short supply alcoa is purchasing a block of power used to operate part of the intalco smelter from powerex british columbia under arrangements that continue through september 2003 

  

the company through apgi generates substantially all of the power used at its warrick smelter using nearby coal reserves a 1996 coal supply contract satisfies up to 70 of the smelter’s fuel requirements through 2006 annual contracts satisfy the remainder of the fuel requirements in april 2001 under the terms of an operating agreement the company assumed operation of the power plants that supply the warrick smelter from southern indiana gas  electric company until at least 2008 

  

the rockdale smelter uses lignite supplied by the company’s sandow mine to generate power see the discussion of litigation involving alcoa’s power plant at the rockdale facility on page 22 below the company has applied for permits to open a new lignite mine the three oaks mine on land it owns or controls adjacent to its existing sandow mine companyowned generating units supply about onehalf of the total requirements of the smelter txu energy supplies the balance through a longterm power contract expiring no sooner than 2013 

  

apgi hydroelectric facilities provide electric power for the aluminum smelters at alcoa tennessee and badin north carolina the tennessee smelter also purchases power from the tennessee valley authority under a contract that extends to 2010 with the badin smelter temporarily idled power generated from apgi’s yadkin system is largely being sold in the regional market 

  

in the northeast the purchased power contracts for the massena and st lawrence new york smelters expire not earlier than june 30 2003 and will be extended for an additional 10 years 

  

upon the successful relicensing by the new york power authority nypa of one of its hydroelectric projects the company however may terminate either of these contracts with one year’s notice it is anticipated that the relicense of the nypa hydroelectric project will be issued in the course of 2003 operation by nypa under the existing license will continue until the relicense is issued 

  

the deschambault and bécancour smelters located in quebec purchase electricity under longterm contracts with hydroquebec that expire in 2014 subject to certain extension provisions the smelter located in baie comeau quebec purchases approximately 65 of its power needs under a longterm contract with hydroquebec that expires in 2014 and receives the rest of its power needs from a 40owned hydroelectric generating company manicouagan power company the recent mou between the government of quebec and alcoa subject to the execution of binding agreements contemplates the extension until 2034 of the existing hydroquebecbaie comeau power contract the sale of an additional quantity of power and the renewal of the manicouagan power company water rights 

  

the eastalco smelter located in frederick maryland and the mt holly smelter in south carolina purchase electricity under contracts that expire march 31 2003 and december 31 2005 respectively subject to certain extension provisions alcoa is currently pursuing an extension of the eastalco contract until at least december 31 2005 

  

australia  electricity 

  

power is generated from extensive brown coal deposits covered by a longterm mineral lease held by aofa and that power currently provides approximately 40 of the electricity for the company’s smelter in point henry victoria the state electricity commission of victoria provides the remaining power for this smelter and all power for the portland smelter under contracts with aofa that extend to 2014 and 2016 respectively

 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company 

  

environmental matters 

  

alcoa is involved in proceedings under the superfund or analogous state provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous substances at a number of sites in the 

  

us the company has committed to participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at several such sites 

  

since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse river adjacent to alcoa’s massena new york plant site under order from the us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known as superfund cercla sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of polychlorinated biphenyl pcb in the fourth quarter of 1999 alcoa submitted an analysis of alternatives report to the epa this report identified potential courses of remedial action related to the pcb contamination of the river the epa indicated to alcoa that it believed additional remedial alternatives needed to be included in the analysis of alternatives report during 2000 and 2001 alcoa completed certain studies and investigations on the river including pilot tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies in february 2002 alcoa submitted a final analysis of alternatives report based on these additional evaluations and included additional remedial alternatives required by the epa the range of costs associated with the remedial alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report is between 2 million and 525 million alcoa believes that rational scientific analysis supports a remedy involving the containment of sediments in place via natural or manmade processes based on the current assessment of the epa decisionmaking process the company has now concluded that the selection of the 2 million alternative based on natural recovery only is remote alcoa continues to believe that alternatives involving the largest amounts of sediment removal should not be selected for the grasse river remedy therefore the company believes that the alternatives that should reasonably be considered for selection range from engineered capping and natural recovery of 30 million to a combination of moderate dredging capping and natural recovery of 90 million accordingly alcoa has adjusted the reserve for the grasse river to 30 million representing the low end of the range of possible alternatives as no one of the alternatives is more likely to be selected than any other the epa’s ultimate selection of a remedy could result in additional liability however as the process allows for input that can influence the scope and cost of the remedy through the issuance of the formal record of decision rod alcoa may be required to record a subsequent reserve adjustment at the time the rod is issued 

  

representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources have asserted that alcoa and reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such resources under federal and state law based on alcoa’s and reynolds’ operations at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal proceedings have not been instituted the company continues to actively investigate these claims 

  

since 1990 alcoa has undertaken investigations and evaluations concerning alleged releases of mercury from its point comfort texas facility into the adjacent lavaca bay pursuant to a superfund order from the epa in march 1994 the epa listed the “alcoa point comfortlavaca bay site” on the national priorities list and alcoa and region vi of the epa entered into an administrative order on consent epa docket no 61194 concerning the site the administrative order required the company to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study under epa oversight following submission by the company of all required information in december 2001 the epa issued its rod selecting the final remedial approach for the site which is fully reserved the company is negotiating a consent order with the epa under which it will undertake to implement the remedy the company and certain federal and state natural resource trustees who previously served alcoa with notice of their intent to file suit to recover damages for alleged loss or injury of natural resources in lavaca bay have cooperatively identified restoration alternatives and approaches for lavaca bay the cost of 

  

such restoration is reserved and alcoa anticipates negotiating a consent decree with the trustees under which it will implement the restoration alcoa does not believe that any additional liability for this site is reasonably possible 

  

in july 2001 the louisiana department of environmental quality deq filed an administrative law proceeding docket no 20015918eq against discovery aluminas inc discovery an alcoa subsidiary and waste management inc waste management seeking civil penalties for alleged infractions of deq’s hazardous waste regulations both discovery and waste management have denied the allegations and formal information discovery is proceeding settlement discussions with waste management and the state are ongoing 

  

in 1994 the epa added reynolds’ troutdale oregon primary aluminum production plant to the national priorities list of superfund sites alcoa has been cooperating with the epa under a september 1995 consent order docket number 10940119106 between reynolds and epa region 10 to identify cleanup solutions for the site further analyses were done to determine the effects of the july 2002 decision to permanently close the troutdale production plant on the number and scope of remedial alternatives for the facility in august 2002 the epa issued a preliminary remedial action plan representing the most probable scope and cost of cleanup that cost has been fully reserved and alcoa does not believe that any additional liability for this site is reasonably possible 

  

on december 26 2001 three citizens groups filed an action in the us district court for the western district of texas against alcoa the groups alleged that activities conducted in the mid1980s at the alcoa power plant in rockdale texas triggered various requirements under the clean air act and the texas clean air act and that the plant did not comply with those requirements the groups also alleged that the plant violated opacity limits on january 29 2002 the company filed its answer to the complaint denying the allegations in addition on january 9 2002 the texas natural resource conservation commission tnrcc issued a notice of enforcement and epa region vi issued a notice of violation against alcoa both notices allege that activities conducted in the mid1980s at the alcoa power plant in rockdale texas triggered requirements under the clean air act and the texas clean air act and the plant did not comply with those requirements on june 24 2002 the us department of justice doj the epa the tnrcc now known as the texas commission on environmental quality “tceq” and alcoa agreed to resolve the texas and federal allegations with the permitting of reduced emission limits for the power plant and the payment of a civil penalty of 15 million as well as supplemental environmental capital projects of 25 million epa doj tceq the citizens groups and alcoa are currently working on the drafting of a consent decree to memorialize the agreement reached by the parties 

  

to meet the terms of a newly issued decision by the western australia minister for the environment amending the license regulating emissions from the wagerup alumina refinery awac was required to implement projects to reduce emissions of odors and nitrogen oxides at the wagerup facility by june 30 2002 if the wagerup facility did not complete the projects by that date wagerup’s alumina production would have been reduced by approximately 6 to the production limits of the prior license until the projects were completed awac met the new standards by the june 30 deadline 

  

in may through october of 2002 eight lawsuits were filed against reynolds and alcoa in the district court of wharton county texas two of which have since been dismissed in the same timeframe five lawsuits were filed in the united states district court southern district of texas victoria division the cases were originally removed to federal court but all but one of them have now been remanded back to state court in wharton county the lawsuits seek to recover damages relating to the presence of trichloroethylene in the groundwater near a former 

  

  

reynolds extrusion facility in el campo texas additional defendants included in some of the lawsuits are the current owners to whom reynolds sold the facility in 1997 bon l campo limited partnership bon l campo and tredegar corporation a few former employees of the current plant owners and two neighboring businesses some of the cases request class certification to include other allegedly affected individuals as plaintiffs damages sought include those for the contamination of private wells diminution of property value medical monitoring and punitive damages reynolds owned and operated the facility from 1971 to 1997 and sold it to bon l campo before alcoa acquired reynolds reynolds and alcoa are currently participating in the voluntary cleanup program under the supervision of the tceq and investigating the area to determine the source of the contamination answers have been filed in all but one of the cases as the last complaint has yet to be served and discovery is being conducted at this time currently the amount of any possible loss cannot be estimated 

  

in august 2000 the doj notified ipc inc “ipc” a wholly owned subsidiary of ivex packaging corporation “ivex” and consolidated fibers inc “cfi” a wholly owned subsidiary of ipc that they were potentially responsible parties prps under cercla at the agriculture street landfill superfund site new orleans louisiana in august 2002 the epa and doj extended an offer to cfi to engage in prefiling settlement discussions regarding the united states’ claim for response costs at the site the epa and doj stated that the government had incurred approximately 406 million in response costs at the site and sought a settlement amount of approximately 138 million to be paid collectively by cfi and other prps ivex contends that cfi’s involvement with the site was minimal the united states filed a complaint in the united states district court for the eastern district of louisiana on december 6 2002 for recovery of its response costs cfi was named as a defendant cfi was served with the complaint on january 15 2003 cfi’s answer now is due on march 17 2003

alcoa does lease some of its facilities however it is the opinion of
management that the leases do not affect the continued use of the properties nor
their values afl and southern graphic systems inc lease most of their
facilities

alcoa believes that its facilities are suitable and adequate for its operations
although no title examination of properties owned by alcoa has been made for the
purpose of this report the company knows of no material defects in title to any
such properties see notes a e and q to the financial statements for
information on properties plants and equipment and lease expense



item 3  legal proceedings

in the ordinary course of its business alcoa is involved in a number of
lawsuits and claims both actual and potential including some that it has
asserted against others while the amounts claimed may be substantial the
ultimate liability cannot now be determined because of the considerable
uncertainties that exist it is possible that results of operations or liquidity
in a particular period could be materially affected by certain contingencies
management believes however that the disposition of matters that are pending
or asserted will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of
the company

environmental matters


alcoa is involved in proceedings under the superfund or analogous state
provisions regarding the usage disposal storage or treatment of hazardous
substances at a number of sites in the us the company has committed to
participate or is engaged in negotiations with federal or state authorities
relative to its alleged liability for participation in cleanup efforts at
several such sites

since 1989 alcoa has been conducting investigations and studies of the grasse
river adjacent to alcoas massena new york plant site under order from the
us environmental protection agency epa issued under section 106 of the
comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act also known
as superfund sediments and fish in the river contain varying levels of
polychlorinated biphenyl pcb in the fourth quarter of 1999 alcoa submitted
an analysis of alternatives report to the epa this report identified potential
courses of remedial action related to the pcb contamination of the river the
epa indicated to alcoa that it believed additional remedial alternatives needed
to be included in the analysis of alternatives report during 2000 and 2001
alcoa completed certain studies and investigations on the river including pilot
tests of sediment capping techniques and other remediation technologies in
february 2002 alcoa submitted a revised draft analysis of alternatives report
based on these additional evaluations and included additional remedial
alternatives required by the epa the additional alternatives required by the
epa involve removal of more sediment than was included in the 1999 analysis of
alternatives report the range of costs associated with the remedial
alternatives evaluated in the 2002 report is between 2 million and 525
million alcoa believes that several of those alternatives involving the
largest amounts of sediment removal should not be selected for the grasse river
remedy alcoa believes the alternatives that should be selected are those
ranging from monitored natural recovery 2 million to a combination of
moderate dredging and capping 90 million a reserve of 2 million has been
recorded for any potential losses as no one of the alternatives is more likely
to be selected than any other

representatives of various us federal and state agencies and a native american
tribe acting in their capacities as trustees for natural resources have
asserted that alcoa and reynolds may be liable for loss or damage to such
resources under federal and state law based on alcoas and reynolds operations
at their massena new york and st lawrence new york facilities while formal
proceedings have not been instituted the company continues to actively
investigate these claims
