protein sciences segment

protein sciences segment products and markets

the protein sciences segment is the larger of our two segments representing about 75 of our net sales in fiscal 2022 it is comprised of two divisions with complementary product offerings serving many of the same customers – the reagent solutions division and the analytical solutions division

the reagent solutions division consists of specialized proteins such as cytokines and growth factors antibodies small molecules tissue culture sera and cell selection technologies traditionally used by researchers to further their life science experimental activities and by companies developing next generation diagnostics and therapeutics including companies developing cell and genebased therapeutics we believe we are the world leader in providing high quality proteins both for research use and under current good manufacturing practices or cgmp key product brands include rd systems tocris biosciences and novus biologicals our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides high quality tools that customers can use in solving complex biological pathways and glean knowledge that may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to address different pathologies in recent years we have made several acquisitions and investments that have expanded our product offerings for the cell and gene therapy market these include a significant investment in stateofthe art facilities for production of both proteins and small molecules in large quantities manufactured in accordance with cgmp as well as an agreement entered into in fiscal 2022 to invest in and potentially acquire wilson wolf manufacturing company which is a leading provider of cell culture devices for cell therapy through a collaborative marketing venture with wilson wolf and another company we have leveraged products we have or are developing to provide a more complete offering for the cell and gene therapy market

the analytical solutions division includes manual and automated protein analysis instruments and immunoassays that are used in quantifying proteins in a variety of biological fluids products in this division include traditional manual platebased immunoassays fully automated multiplex immunoassays on various instrument platforms automated western blotting and isoelectric focusing analysis of complex protein samples key product brands include rd systems and proteinsimple a number of our products have been demonstrated to have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including cancer autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation neurological disorders and kidney failure immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics in fact we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for a few of our immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices in addition subsequent to fiscal 2022 we closed on the acquisition of namocell inc a leading provider of single cell sorting and dispensing platforms that are gentle to cells and therefore preserve cell viability and integrity

protein sciences segment customers and distribution methods

our customers for this segment include researchers in academia government and industry chiefly pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as contract research organizations this segment also sells to diagnosticcompanion diagnostic and therapeutic customers including customers engaged in the development of cell and genebased therapies our biologics line of products in the analytical solutions division is used chiefly by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies we sell our products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china as well as through a distribution agreement with fisher scientific we also sell through third party distributors in china japan certain eastern european countries and the rest of the world our sales are widely 

distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of the protein sciences segment’s net sales during fiscal 2022 2021 and 2020

diagnostics and genomics segment

the diagnostics and genomics segment representing about 25 of our net revenues in fiscal 2022 is comprised of three divisions and is focused primarily on the diagnostics market and includes spatial biology liquid biopsy molecular diagnostics kits and products and diagnostics reagents

diagnostics and genomics segment products

the spatial biology division products sold under the advanced cell diagnostics or acd brand are novel insitu hybridization ish assays for transcriptome dna copy and structural variation analysis within intact cells providing highly sensitive and specific spatial information at single cell resolution since these products preserve spatial context they are particularly useful for complex tissue profiling 

the molecular diagnostics division markets and sells products and services under the exosome diagnostics and asuragen brands the exosome diagnostics brand is based on exosomebased liquid biopsy techniques that analyze genes or their transcripts it includes the exodx prostate test which is a urinebased assay for early detection of highgrade prostate cancer used as an aid in deciding the need for biopsy and offered by exosome diagnostics as a labdeveloped test as well as the exotru kidney transplant rejection test which we have licensed exclusively to thermo fisher scientific we also sell products for genetic carrier screening oncology diagnostics molecular controls and research under the asuragen brand 

the diagnostic reagents division consists of regulated products traditionally used as calibrators and controls in the clinical setting also included are instrument and process control products for hematology blood chemistry blood gases coagulation controls and reagents used in various diagnostic applications we often manufacture these reagents on a custom basis tailored to a customer’s specific diagnostic assay technology we supply these reagents in various formats including liquid frozen or in lyophilized form most of these products are sold on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis to instrument manufacturers with most products being fdacleared

diagnostics and genomics segment customers and distribution methods

the customers for the spatial biology division include researchers in academia as well as investigators in pharmaceutical and biotech companies we sell our products directly to those customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china and through distributors elsewhere in addition to being useful research tools our dna and rna in situ hybridization ish assays have diagnostics applications as well and several are cleared or currently under review by the fda in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies 

in the united states we offer the exosomedx prostate test to physicians using our labdeveloped noninvasive urinebased assay for prostate cancer detection our diagnostic laboratory is certified under and regulated by the state of massachusetts pursuant to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments or clia we reach our customers through physicians prescribing such tests for their patients this test is also available in europe as a cemarked product the asuragenbranded products are sold primarily to laboratories for use in labdeveloped tests or in kit form as regulated diagnostic tests

the majority of diagnostic reagents division’s sales are through oem agreements but we sell some of our diagnostic reagent products directly to customers and in europe and asia also through distributors 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of the reporting segment’s consolidated net sales during fiscal years 2022 2021 or 2020

manufacturing and materials

our manufacturing operations use a wide variety of raw materials and components including electronic components chemicals and biological materials no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular 

specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain which in certain cases includes the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources

the majority of our products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders other than our instruments and related cartridges which are typically shipped within one to two weeks of receipt of an order there was no significant backlog of orders for our products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2022 for additional discussion of risks relating to supply chain and manufacturing refer to “item 1a risk factors”

competition

although our segments both generally operate in highly competitive markets it is difficult to determine our competitive position either in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as the company or any of its segments does because of the range of the products and services we sell we encounter a wide variety of competitors including a number of large global companies or divisions of such companies with substantial capabilities and resources as well a number of smaller niche competitors with specialized product offerings we have seen increased competition in a number of our markets as a result of the entry of new companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product line key competitive factors vary among the company’s businesses but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality and safety performance delivery speed application expertise service and support technology and innovation distribution network breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition we believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of many of our products and our product quality for a discussion of risks related to competition refer to “item 1a risk factors”

seasonality of business

biotechne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base particularly for the protein sciences segment 

there is also some seasonality for the exosomedx prostate test as patients tend to avoid scheduling medical appointments during the summer and other holidays a majority of diagnostics reagents division products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer consequently sales for that division can be unpredictable and not necessarily based on seasonality as a result we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue from the diagnostics and genomics segment

government contracts 

although the company transacts business with various government entities no government contract is of such magnitude that renegotiation of profits or termination of the contract at the election of the government entity would have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial results as a party to these contracts biotechne does have to comply with certain regulations that apply to companies doing business with governments for a discussion of risks related to government contracting requirements see “item 1a risk factors” 

new products and research and development 

we believe that our future success depends to a large extent on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs biotechne is engaged in continuous research and development in all of our major product lines we also carry out research to develop new products that build upon and expand the technologies we acquire through our acquisition strategy in fiscal 2022 we introduced over 1000 new products while this is an area of focus for the company there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phases can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace 

human capital 

through its subsidiaries biotechne employed approximately 3000 fulltime and parttime employees as of june 30 2022 of whom approximately 2300 were employed in the united states and approximately 650 outside the united states none of the united states employees are unionized outside the united states the company has governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements or work councils in certain countries

biotechne is committed to attracting developing engaging and retaining the best people possible from around the world to sustain and grow our leadership position in life sciences tools and diagnostics we strive to create an employee experience that allows each to achieve their life’s best work this is demonstrated by leading with our epic values of empowerment passion innovation and collaboration we continuously build on our peoplefirst culture led by uncompromising integrity hosting a place of belonging granting access to innovation and respecting human rights around the globe 

our talent management strategy spans multiple key dimensions including the following

culture and governance 

our four epic values of empowerment passion innovation and collaboration are the backbone for the way we approach the leadership and direction of our work force employees are empowered to realize their potential our culture supports and encourages a collaborative approach to working with each other and with our customers we encourage innovation to continually improve our products services and processes and our passions for science and the missions of our customers are our guiding lights

our epic values are embedded in our culture and practices for example our performance management system and annual review processes incorporate our epic values each employee is measured against the behaviors and attributes that support those values to further amplify our desired behaviors we have an annual employee recognition program in which we ask for nominations and recognize winning individuals and teams form across our business who have best demonstrated our epic values

biotechne’s board of directors reviews management succession planning at least annually and its compensation committee reviews the company’s talent management strategy periodically in connection with significant initiatives and acquisitions as well as part of its oversight of our executive and equity compensation programs at the management level our chief human resources officer who reports directly to our president and ceo is responsible for the development and execution of the company’s talent management strategy

engagement and belonging 

our engagement strategy focuses on developing the best workplace and best people leaders to meet our employees’ needs we believe that strong employee engagement helps enable higher retention and better business performance we also engage more formally via an annual engagement survey that assesses our employees’ overall experience in 2021 73 of our global workforce participated and 87 of those who responded provided positive feedback while these responses were positive our management used the responses to inform and shape our future employeefocused initiatives these initiatives in the past have resulted in changes in programs and policies including expansion of our management and leadership development programs addition of a parental leave program expansion of our incentive programs to include annual cash bonuses to all employees introduction of flexible working and expanding the breadth of our employee resource groups ergs

we believe a diverse workforce and culture of belonging are both essential to drive innovation fuel growth and help ensure our technologies and products effectively serve a global customer base the company’s executivesponsored belonging initiative is focused on providing a welcoming working environment for all employees continued education broadening our candidate pools and implementing and sustaining programs one of the centerpieces of our talent development strategy is our ergs they offer mentorship support and engagement to help our employees including those from underrepresented groups succeed and thrive as of june 30 2022 we had 10 ergs operating globally 

as of june 30 2022 49 of our total employee population was female and 46 of our managerial employees were female in the united states 37 of our total employee population identified as nonwhite and 36 of our managerial employees identified as nonwhite 

recruitment and retention 

we believe that sustaining our profitable growth will require a continued focus on recruiting and retaining top diverse talent we engage in a variety of recruiting strategies intended to locate and identify qualified candidates and to maintain a talent pipeline the company offers competitive pay and benefits from flexible work to financial planning resources to an employee stock purchase plan in fiscal 2022 we bolstered our recruitment and retention efforts by expanding eligibility to receive stock options and annual cash bonuses 

in addition to pay and benefits we believe one key to retention is to maintain an environment in which employees can work productively and enjoy opportunities to develop and advance the company seeks to cultivate a culture of empowerment and collaboration allowing employees to understand the impact of their efforts and see opportunities for career growth we believe that our focus and investment in recruitment and retention contributed to our inclusion on the forbes list as one of america’s best midsize employers as well as one of the best employers for diversity 

the last fiscal year saw considerable employee turnover in all industries including the biotechnology industry and we were able to adapt and respond to turnover pressures in our industry to deliver strong growth and profitability we believe our sustained efforts to enhance recruitment and retention will allow us to remain resilient and productive in the face of increased employee mobility and economic challenge

talent development and learning and development 

biotechne invests in people development with the belief that growing and promoting employees from within the company creates a more sustainable organization high potential and promotable employees are identified through our annual talent review strategy these employees are elevated to the attention of senior management and may be considered for additional development and career advancement opportunities 

our global learning and development program delivers a wide range of initiatives including a validated suite of compliance training and soft technical business interpersonal and career skills many of these programs are assigned to individuals specifically in addition there are some programs available to employees in order to accelerate their own development as a company that regularly acquires other businesses we believe it is important for employees to be trained in the skills and mindsets that enable them to respond positively to change this initiative allows individuals to deal with change easily and reduces the need to run large scale change management programs

wellbeing and safety 

the company is committed to protecting the physical health and psychological wellbeing of our employees by providing a safe work environment we train all employees on foundational safety principles and require more rigorous safety and hazard awareness training where appropriate based on function role or team all employees are empowered and encouraged to maintain and create a safe workplace in addition we offer internal and external resources to provide for the psychological and emotional security of employees including employee resource programs and mental health benefit coverage 

the covid19 pandemic imposed new and unusual challenges in maintaining a safe workplace as an essential business providing key research and diagnostics products needed to confront the pandemic biotechne maintained operations while providing a safe work environment through staggered shifts work from home protocols where possible masking and vaccine requirements and other significant safety measures 

community 

the company believes in giving back and in supporting the local communities in which we live and work the company and its employees donate financially and by giving their time and energy most sites or departments engage in local charitable causes and activities in some of our sites employees are encouraged to give through regular payroll deductions 

and through the annual campaign week where employee contributions are matched by the company some charitable causes are identified and promoted by our ergs in addition united states employees receive eight hours of voluntary paid time off to participate in local opportunities to give back to the community

intellectual property

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections in our terms and conditions and other salesrelated documentation

as of june 30 2022 we had rights to approximately 440 granted patents and approximately 270 pending patent applications products in the analytical solutions and genomics divisions are protected primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents in addition certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio patent protection if granted generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant we cannot provide assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors’ products or services

in addition to pursuing patents on our products we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets particularly in the reagent solutions division of our protein sciences segment where appropriate we use trademarks or registered trademarks in connection with our products we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees consultants corporate partners and when needed our advisors see the description of risks associated with the company’s intellectual property in “item 1a risk factors”

we can give no assurance that biotechne’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others biotechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights biotechne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive andor nonexclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research andor diagnostics markets

 item 1a risk factors

set forth below are risks and uncertainties we believe are material to our investors you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the section titled information relating to forwardlooking statements at the beginning of this annual report on form 10k 

economic and industry risks 

conditions in the global economy the particular markets we serve and the financial markets whether brought about by material global crises or other factors may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our business is sensitive to global economic conditions slower economic growth in the domestic or international markets inflation recession volatility in the credit and currency markets high levels of unemployment or underemployment labor availability constraints changes or anticipation of potential changes in government trade fiscal tax or monetary policies government budget dynamics particularly in the healthcare and scientific research areas and other challenges in the global economy have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the company and its distributors customers and suppliers in the past three years covid19 has had and likely will continue to have an adverse impact on the global economy including as a result of impacts associated with protective health measures that we other businesses and governments are taking or might have to take again in the future to manage the pandemic for example as the world has grappled with the covid19 pandemic some governments including the people’s republic of china have continued to impose strict “stayathome” orders to manage the pandemic which have significantly impacted the economy in that country and our business there should these restrictions continue in china or if they are imposed again elsewhere our business could be materially impacted 

without limiting the foregoing we have experienced andor may in the future experience

● adverse impacts on customer orders and purchases and unpredictable reductions in demand for many of our products

​ 

● constraints on the movement of our products through the supply chain which can disrupt our ability to produce or deliver our products 

​ 

● adverse impacts on our collections of accounts receivable including delays in collections and increases in uncollectible receivables as well as the risk of excess or obsolete inventory

​ 

● price increases in our raw materials and capital equipment as well as increasing price competition in our markets

​ 

● adverse impacts on our workforce andor key employees

​ 

● increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations which in addition to increasing the risks identified above could result in preference actions against us and

​ 

● adverse impact to the sizes and growth rates of the markets we serve

​ 

if growth in the global economy or in any of the markets we serve slows for a significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such markets or if improvements in the global economy do not benefit the markets we serve our business and financial results can be adversely affected

international political compliance and business factors including the military conflict in ukraine and the united kingdom ’ s withdrawal from the european union can negatively impact our operations and financial results 

we engage in business globally with approximately 42 of our sales revenue in fiscal 2022 coming from outside the us changes potential changes or uncertainties in social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies 

governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system can adversely affect our business and financial results for example congress and the us administration are also considering significant changes to healthcare in the united states including government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs such impacts could negatively impact certain markets we serve resulting in adverse impact on our sales revenue 

political and military conflicts may disrupt our business or negatively impact global economic or business conditions for example russia’s military invasion of ukraine and the response by the us and european countries to that invasion have caused severe political humanitarian and economic crises not only in europe but globally restrictions on trade particularly involving certain foods and energy supplies have increased prices led to widespread inflation and otherwise aggravated the economic challenges resulting from the covid19 pandemic while we have not historically had significant business in either russia or ukraine the broader impact of the conflict could negatively impact our operations and financial results 

additionally the uk’s exit from the european union at the end of calendar year 2020 continues to create political and economic uncertainty particularly in the uk and the eu having disrupted the free flow of goods and people between the uk and the eu in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the uk and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the uk any of these factors have affected and could continue to adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial results particularly since our european headquarters and primary shipping facilities have traditionally been centered in the uk

one of our strategies is to expand geographically particularly in china india and in developing countries both through distribution and through direct operations this subjects us to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions currency fluctuations tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond our control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases

the application of laws and regulations impacting global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibited business conduct and damage to our reputation we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us

we continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with our internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by our internal policies could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties

the healthcare and life sciences industries that we serve face constant pressures and changes in an effort to reduce healthcare costs or increase their predictability all of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

our protein sciences segment products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions in addition to the impacts described above relating to covid19 research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies we carry essentially no 

backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

our genomics and diagnostics segment includes products for the medical diagnostics market which relies largely on government healthcarerelated policies and funding changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and correspondingly our sales to them for example our exosome diagnostics business develops and sells novel exosomebased diagnostic tests while we received public payer coverage for certain uses we are currently seeking expanded coverage from public payors as well as coverage decisions regarding reimbursement from additional private payers however the process and timeline for obtaining coverage decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict further reimbursement reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment such as prior authorization diagnosis code and other claims edits or a physician or qualified practitioner’s signature on test requisitions may be implemented from time to time all of these payor actions and changes may have a material adverse effect on revenue and earnings associated with our diagnostics products

acquisition and investment risks 

our inability to complete acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price  

one of our key strategies is growth through acquisition of other businesses and assets our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers or investors the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments

our acquisition of businesses investments joint ventures and other strategic relationships if not properly implemented or integrated could negatively impact our business and financial results 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions we joined with two partners to establish a collaborative marketing venture scaleready llc to address the needs of the rapidly expanding cell and gene therapy market and subsequently announced that we had entered into an option agreement to potentially invest in and then acquire one of those partners wilson wolf manufacturing more recently subsequent to the end of our fiscal year we acquired namocell inc a single cell sorting and dispensing platform company while we believe these business ventures will advance our business strategies and support our growth plans we may not be successful in managing or integrating them into our company acquisitions investments joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of additional financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including but not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial results

● businesses technologies services and products that we acquire or invest in sometimes underperform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid fail to perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or fail to achieve andor sustain profitability

​ 

● we from time to time incur or assume debt in connection with our acquisitions and investments which can result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense and diminish our future access to the capital markets

​ 

● acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships can cause our financial results to differ from our own or the investment community’s expectations in any given period or over the longterm

​ 

● acquisitions investments joint ventures or strategic relationships can create demands on our management operational resources and financial and internal control systems that we may be unable to effectively address

​ 

● we can experience difficulty in integrating cultures personnel operations and financial and other controls and systems and retaining key employees and customers

​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

 ​ 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired which could negatively impact our financial results or stock price 

we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment and declines in the financial condition of our business we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired any such charge would adversely impact our financial results

in addition the company’s expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company’s business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected 

strategic and operational risks 

our success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified and diverse personnel and creating and maintaining a culture that successfully integrates the employees joining through acquisitions 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production sales and marketing and management personnel representing diverse backgrounds experiences and skill sets are critical to our success the market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our businesses particularly in the areas of science and technology is extremely competitive in fiscal 2022 a number of our businesses and departments faced labor availability constraints and inflationary costs in general we have been experiencing turnover at higher rates than usual and have had some difficulties filling certain positions in particular we operate in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong making employee retention even more challenging for example some of our fastest growing businesses are located in california and massachusetts both of which in the last several years have had low unemployment and a particularly competitive environment for finding and retaining talent our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees as we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing finally as the geographies in which we operate recover from the recent 

pandemic and we return employees who had been working from home back to our sites we may not be able to retain people who prefer continuing to work from home full time the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization of new and enhanced products and services that meet our customers ’ needs our growth can also be negatively impacted if our customers do not grow as anticipated 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and new market entrants and competitors if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial results will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to

● correctly identify andor predict customer needs and preferences

​ 

● allocate our research funding to products with higher growth prospects

​ 

● anticipate and respond to our competitors’ development of new products and technological innovations

​ 

● differentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings and avoid our products from becoming commodities

​ 

● innovate and develop new technologies and applications and acquire or obtain rights to thirdparty technologies that may have valuable applications in the markets we serve

​ 

● obtain adequate intellectual property rights with respect to key technologies

​ 

● successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner price them competitively and costeffectively manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time

​ 

 ​ 

● stimulate customer demand for and convince customers to adopt new technologies

​ 

if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our business and financial results even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products we often incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share or need to reduce prices to remain competitive 

we face intense competition across most of our product lines competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than us in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on us moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in countries in asia and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new 

markets including highgrowth markets our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements for example increased demand for more environmentallyfriendly products and supplier practices our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial results and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses

a significant disruption in or breach of security of our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could result in damage to our reputation data integrity andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits under data privacy or other laws or contractual requirements 

the integrity and protection of our own data and that of our customers and employees is critical to our business we rely on information technology systems some of which are provided andor managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations these systems products and services including those we acquire through business acquisitions can be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks can also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process store or transmit electronic information can result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers patients or suppliers these attacks breaches misappropriations and other disruptions and damage can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets result in disclosure of personally identifiable information damage customer patient business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial results

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop or integrate new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards evolving customer expectations changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems or appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states a small number of our businesses are subject to hipaa entities that violate hipaa due to a breach of unsecured patient health information or that arise from a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa noncompliance individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy most notably in the last several years some states including california virginia utah colorado and connecticut have passed broad privacy legislation that could result in more material impacts as new regulations are issued european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in significant fines and other administrative penalties several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the 

regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial results

if we suffer loss to our supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

our supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane power shortage or outage public health crisis including epidemics and pandemics and the reaction thereto war terrorism riot or other natural or manmade disasters such as the covid19 pandemic if any of these supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services diminish demand damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses

the manufacture of many of our products is a complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our business and financial results could suffer 

the manufacture of many of our products is a complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements for some of our products problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with reliable sourcing of raw materials or components natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the quality requirements of some of our customers as well as stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products alternative manufacturing or sourcing is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant adverse impacts to our business and financial results

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our business and financial results may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services can cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in many of our manufacturing operations our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers from time to time extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial results may suffer

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions such as trade protectionism and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors can result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products which if disrupted could materially impair our business operations our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites 

the company’s internal quality control packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the company’s sales since certain company products must comply with fda regulations and because in all instances the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while we have taken certain steps to manage these operational risks the company’s future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

climate change or legal or regulatory measures to address climate change may negatively affect us 

climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could present risks to our operations for example we have significant operations in california where serious drought has made water less available and more costly and has increased the risk of wildfires changes in climate patterns leading to extreme heat waves or unusual cold weather at some of our locations can lead to increased energy usage and costs or otherwise adversely impact our facilities and operations and disrupt our supply chains and distribution systems concern over climate change can also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment any such new or additional legal or regulatory requirements may increase the costs associated with or disrupt sourcing manufacturing and distribution of our products which may adversely affect our business and financial results in addition any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations with respect to environmental social and governance “esg” matters may result in the loss of business adverse reputational impacts diluted market valuations and challenges in attracting and retaining customers and talented employees in addition our adoption of certain standards or mandated compliance to certain requirements could necessitate additional investments that could impact our profitability 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or allegations thereof can adversely affect our business and financial results 

certain of our products and services are sold for use in diagnostics for those products and services in particular manufacturing or design defects in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death andor property damage and adversely affect our business and financial results these events can lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

most of our reagent products need to be stored and shipped at certain cold temperatures consequently we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers by express mail or air delivery through package delivery companies such as fedex in the us and dhl in europe if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

intellectual property risks 

we are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

many of the markets we serve are technologydriven and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designed around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing in some circumstances enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights

these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information intellectual property technology and other assets comparable to the united states we operate globally with manufacturing operations in china and the uk and approximately 42 of our revenue in fiscal 2022 was from outside the united states the laws regulations and enforcement mechanisms in other countries may in some cases be less protective of our intellectual property rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business and financial results

we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope coverage and validity of others’ proprietary rights or to defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement any of which could be timeintensive and costly and may adversely impact our business 

our success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate we have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus from other business concerns if we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others we could be required to cease certain activities alter 

our products or processes or pay licensing fees this could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent we may be unable to sell some of our products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if we do not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect our earnings

financial and tax risks 

we have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility and we may incur additional debt in the future the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy 

we currently have a credit agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of 600 million which can be increased by an additional 200 million subject to certain conditions and a term loan of 250 million borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of august 19 2022 the company had drawn 346 million under the credit agreement

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as

● limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund our working capital capital expenditures debt service requirements expansion strategy or other needs

​ 

● increasing our vulnerability to and reducing our flexibility in planning for adverse changes in economic industry and competitive conditions and

​ 

● increasing our vulnerability to increases in interest rates

​ 

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends

our business and financial results can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates changes in our tax rates and tax liabilities and assessments including as a result of changes in tax laws 

international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in fiscal 2022 currency translation had an unfavorable effect of 125 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act which became effective in late 2017 which included broad and complex changes 

to the united states tax code interpretations assumptions and guidance regarding the tax act that have been issued subsequently have had a material impact on our effective tax rate and we anticipate that there may be additional changes to the us tax code in the future

in preparing our financial results we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

for many years our board has declared quarterly dividends in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

legal regulatory compliance and reputational risks 

our business is subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as referenced in more detail above we and our customers must comply with a wide array of federal state local and international regulations in such areas as medical device healthcare import and export anticorruption and privacy we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs and diagnostic products changes in the us fda’s regulation of drug or medical device products could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the us and elsewhere and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government approximately 2 of our fiscal 2022 sales were made to the us federal government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the us fda the us drug enforcement agency the dea the us department of health and human services the dhhs and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale the manufacture distribution and marketing of many of our products and services including medical devices and pharma services are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea and other equivalent local state federal and nonus regulatory authorities in addition we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities we are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers’ ability to provide products to their customers

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticompetition laws any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits 

and licenses could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

significant developments or changes in us laws or policies including changes in us trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto can have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

significant developments or changes in us laws and policies including as a result of changes in party control of congress or decisions from the us supreme court such as laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system and drug prices can adversely affect our business and financial results for example the previous us administration increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states and trade tensions between the united states and china escalated with each country imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country that trade tension has not diminished under the current us administration the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect our access to markets these factors have adversely affected and in the future could further adversely affect our business and financial results

our business and financial results can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems including our code of ethics and business conduct protect us from unauthorized acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance economic and trade sanctions money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business and financial results

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results 

as stated above certain of our products are medical devices diagnostics tests and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda or state clia regulations by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugsof abuse or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations including implementation of ivdr regulations in europe for example the eu has adopted the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostic medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of in vitro diagnostics medical devices that have been marketed and sold under the prior regulatory regime now have to comply with some of the new eu ivdr requirements while the effective date of other requirements have been delayed complying with eu ivdr the regulation applicable to the company may require material modifications to our quality management systems additional resources in certain functions updates to technical files and additional clinical data in some cases among other changes failure by us or by our customers to comply with 

the requirements of the eu ivdr or other requirements imposed by these or similar regulatory authorities including without limitation remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs any or all of which could be significant failure to meet these requirements adversely impacts our business and financial results in the applicable geographies

government authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations agency guidance or case law failure to obtain required regulatory clearances before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of laws or regulations failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share remediation and increased compliance costs recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products fines expenses injunctions civil penalties criminal penalties consent decrees administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance suspension or withdrawal of approvals premarket notification rescissions and other adverse effects further defending against any such actions can be costly and timeconsuming and may require significant personnel resources therefore even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us our business may be impaired ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs

more specifically as a healthcare provider the company’s exosome diagnostics’ exodx prostate business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal state and local levels in the us and other countries where it operates the company’s failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians hospitals and health systems could lead to civil and criminal penalties exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possibly prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position such occurrences regardless of their outcome could damage the company’s reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties

failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines penalties and damage to the company ’ s reputation and have a material adverse effect upon the company ’ s business a risk that has been elevated with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics whose laboratory testing service is a healthcare provider that obtains and uses protected health information 

if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information it could be subject to monetary fines civil penalties or criminal sanctions in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa privacy and security regulations including the expanded requirements under us health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information phi by covered entities in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and security of phi hipaa restricts the company’s ability to use or disclose phi without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations if the laboratory operations for the company’s business use or disclose phi improperly under these privacy regulations they may incur significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

business combinations

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition the calculations used to determine the fair value of the longlived assets acquired 

primarily intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgment we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including but not limited to the nature of the acquired company’s business its competitive position strengths and challenges its historical financial position and performance estimated customer retention rates discount rates and future plans for the combined entity we may also engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired longlived assets

the fair value of acquired technology is generally the primary asset identified and therefore estimated using the multiperiod excess earnings method the multiperiod excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets such as trade names and inprocess research and development that contributed to the generation of the cash flows the resulting cash flow which is attributable solely to the primary asset acquired is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value the trade name is generally calculated using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings inprocess research and development assets are valued using the multiperiod excess earnings method when the cash flows from the inprocess research and development assets are separately identifiable from the primary asset in circumstances that customer relationship assets are identified that are not the primary asset they are valued using the distributor model income approach which isolates revenues and cash flow associated with the sales and distribution function of the entity and attributable to customerrelated assets which are then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value

we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made for potential payments related to financial performance based milestones projected revenue andor ebitda amounts volatility and discount rates assumptions are included in the estimated amounts for potential payments related to product development milestones the fair value is based on the probability of achievement of such milestones the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets which determines the amount of acquisitionrelated amortization expense we will record in future periods each reporting period we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization

while we use our best estimates and assumptions our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings

the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income for example different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ consequently to the extent a longerlived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorterlived asset net income in a given period may be higher additionally assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill as goodwill is not amortized this would benefit net income in a given period although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis

impairment of goodwill

goodwill

goodwill was 8221 million as of june 30 2022 which represented 36 of total assets goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment

to analyze goodwill for impairment we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments which considers among other things the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business

in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 the company combined the management of the exosome diagnostics and asuragen reporting units both of which are included in the diagnostics and genomics operating segment in conjunction with the combination of the reporting units a qualitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed the qualitative assessment identified no indicators of impairment

in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 changzhou eminence biotechnology co ltd eminence notified the company of its need for additional capital to execute its growth plan the company first attempted to find outside equity financing support for the eminence investment but was unable to do so the company then reviewed the additional financing needs required to successfully ramp eminence’s business which ultimately did not meet the company’s return on capital requirements therefore the company did not provide additional funding to eminence as a result of not obtaining additional financing eminence notified the company of its plans to cease operations and liquidate its business

given the upcoming liquidation process to dispose of the eminence assets the company identified a triggering event and performed impairment testing during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 the impairment testing resulted in a full impairment of the eminence goodwill and intangible assets which resulted in charges of 83 million and 86 million respectively for the year ended june 30 2022 the company also recognized inventory and fixed asset impairment charges of 09 million and 09 million respectively the company recorded the impairment charges within the general and administrative line in the consolidated income statement the impairment charges recorded within net earnings attributable to biotechne were reduced by approximately 8 million recorded within net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests the remaining net tangible assets of eminence included in our consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2022 were 43 million and primarily consisted of fixed assets and related deposits of 31 million inventory of 06 million receivables of 04 million and other current assets of 01 million the company also had 45 million related to current liabilities the company holds a financial interest of approximately 574 in those tangible assets in the upcoming liquidation process

2022 goodwill impairment analyses 

in completing our 2022 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all five of our reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 2017‑04 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the value weighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

the result of our quantitative assessment indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom as of april 1 2022 this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting unit’s results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units the company did not identify any triggering events after our annual 

goodwill impairment through june 30 2022 the date of our consolidated balance sheet that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment to be performed

2021 goodwill impairment analyses

in completing our 2021 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for each of our five reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 201704 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

because our 2021 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units the summation of our reporting units’ fair values as indicated by our discounted cash flow calculations were compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting unit’s results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

the quantitative assessment completed as of april 1 2021 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom accordingly the company determined there was no indication of impairment of goodwill in our annual goodwill impairment analysis further no triggering events were identified in the year ended june 30 2021 that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment beyond our required annual goodwill impairment assessment

2020 goodwill impairment analyses

in completing our 2020 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 201704 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting unit’s financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

nongaap financial measures

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap these nongaap measures include

 ​ 

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results we use these nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions including with respect to incentive compensation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for periodtoperiod comparison of results

our nongaap financial measure of organic growth represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceding 12 months the impact of foreign currency as well as the impact of partiallyowned consolidated subsidiaries excluding these measures provides more useful periodtoperiod comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which can vary significantly from period to period and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period revenue from partiallyowned subsidiaries consolidated in our financial statements are also excluded from our organic revenue calculation as those revenues are not fully attributable to the company revenue from partiallyowned subsidiaries was 46 million for the year ended june 30 2022

our nongaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis exclude stockbased compensation the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory amortization of acquisition intangibles acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration and other nonrecurring items including nonrecurring costs goodwill and longlived asset impairments and gains stockbased compensation is excluded from nongaap adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge specifically the varying available valuation methodologies subjection assumptions variety of award types and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets purchase accounting adjustments including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisitionrelated expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value contingent consideration and other nonrecurring items including gains or losses on legal settlements goodwill and longlived asset impairment charges and onetime assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events and are not reflective of our internal investments the costs of developing producing supporting and selling our products and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure additionally these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity the company also excludes revenue and expense attributable to partiallyowned consolidated subsidiaries in the calculation of our nongaap financial measures as the revenues and expenses are not fully attributable to the company

the company’s nongaap adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis also excludes stockbased compensation expense which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards restructuring impairments of equity method investments gain and losses from investments and certain adjustments to income tax expense impairments of equity investments are excluded as they are not part of our daytoday operating decisions additionally gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded costs related to restructuring activities including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs the company independently calculates a nongaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified nongaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments in addition the tax impact of other discrete and nonrecurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings we believe these tax items can significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs andor income associated with historical trends and future results

the company periodically reassesses the components of our nongaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance changes in how we make financial and operational decisions and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful

readers are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the company to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures provided within the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures

about market risk

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 34 of the company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 were made in foreign currencies including 12 in euro 4 in british pound sterling 7 in chinese yuan and the remaining 11 in other currencies the company is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling chinese yuan and canadian dollar as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company’s foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation

monthend exchange rates between the euro british pound sterling chinese yuan canadian dollar and the us dollar which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods were as follows

 ​ 

the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements but receivable or payable in another currency

the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other nonoperating expense net in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss

the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10 appreciation in the us dollar from june 30 2022 levels against the euro british pound sterling chinese yuan and canadian dollar are as follows in thousands

protein sciences segment 

 

protein sciences segment products and markets 

 

the protein sciences segment is the larger of our two segments representing about 75 of our net sales in fiscal 2021 it is comprised of two divisions with complementary product offerings serving many of the same customers – the reagent solutions division and the analytical solutions division

 

the reagent solutions division consists of specialized proteins such as cytokines and growth factors antibodies small molecules tissue culture sera and cell selection technologies traditionally used by researchers to further their life science experimental activities and by companies developing next generation diagnostics and therapeutics including companies developing cell and genebased therapeutics key product brands include rd systems tocris biosciences and novus biologicals our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides high quality tools that customers can use in solving complex biological pathways and glean knowledge that may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to address different pathologies with the 2019 acquisitions of quad technologies which has novel quickgel™ technologies for cell separation and activation and bmogen technologies which has a nonviral transposonbased technology for gene editing called tcbuster we have expanded our product offerings for the cell and gene therapy market through a collaborative marketing venture with two other companies we have leveraged these and other products we have or are developing to provide a more complete offering for the cell and gene therapy market

 

the analytical solutions division includes manual and automated protein analysis instruments and immunoassays that are used in quantifying proteins in a variety of biological fluids products in this division include traditional manual platebased immunoassays fully automated multiplex immunoassays on various instrument platforms and automated western blotting and isoelectric focusing analysis of complex protein samples key product brands include rd systems and proteinsimple a number of our products have been demonstrated to have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including cancer autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation neurological disorders and kidney failure immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics in fact we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for a few of our immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices in response to the covid19 pandemic we partnered with mount sinai hospital and its commercial entity kantaro biosciences to rapidly develop and commercialize an immunoassay kit intended to test for antibodies to covid19 which has received regulatory clearance in several jurisdictions including an emergency use authorization from the fda

 

protein sciences segment customers and distribution methods 

 

our customers for this segment include researchers in academia government and industry chiefly pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as diagnosticcompanion diagnostic and therapeutic customers especially customers engaged in the development of cell and gene based therapies our biologics line of products in the analytical solutions division is used primarily by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies we sell our products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china as well as through a distribution agreement with fisher scientific we also sell through third party distributors in china japan certain eastern european countries and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of the protein sciences segments net sales during fiscal 2021 2020 or 2019

 

diagnostics and genomics segment 

 

the diagnostics and genomics segment representing about 25 of our net revenues in fiscal 2021 is focused primarily on the diagnostics market and includes diagnostics reagents genomics our exosome acquisition and our asuragen acquisition

 

diagnostics and genomics segment products 

 

the diagnostic reagents division consists of regulated products traditionally used as calibrators and controls in the clinical setting also included are instrument and process control products for hematology blood chemistry blood gases coagulation controls and reagents used in various diagnostic applications often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis tailored to a customers specific diagnostic assay technology we supply these reagents in various formats including liquid frozen or in lyophilized form most of these products are sold on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis to instrument manufacturers with most products being fdacleared

 

the genomics division includes products using nucleic acid rna or dna analysis that can be used for diagnostic or research applications key product brands include advanced cell diagnostics or acd exosome diagnostics and asuragen acd products are aimed at tissue biopsy and spatial analysis exosome diagnostics focuses on exosomebased liquid biopsy techniques that analyze genes or their transcripts the first commercialized test from exosome diagnostics is a urinebased assay for early detection of highgrade prostate cancer used as an aid in deciding the need for an initial biopsy our most recent acquisition is asuragen which makes and sells products for genetic carrier screening oncology diagnostics molecular controls and research

 

 

diagnostics and genomics segment customers and distribution methods 

 

the majority of diagnostic reagents divisions sales are through oem agreements but we sell some of our diagnostics reagents products directly to customers and in europe and asia also through distributors the customers for the acd research products include researchers in academia as well as investigators in pharmaceutical and biotech companies we sell our products directly to those customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china and through distributors elsewhere in addition to being useful research tools our dna and rna in situ hybridization assays have diagnostics applications as well and several are cleared or currently under review by the fda in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in the united states we offer test services to physicians using our labdeveloped noninvasive urinebased assay for prostate cancer detection our diagnostic laboratory is certified under and regulated by the state of massachusetts pursuant to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments or clia customers are physicians prescribing such tests for their patients finally the asuragen products are sold primarily to laboratories for use in labdeveloped tests or in kit form as regulated diagnostic tests 

 

no customers accounted for 10 or more of the reporting segments consolidated net sales during fiscal years 2021 2020 or 2019

 

manufacturing and materials 

 

our manufacturing operations use a wide variety of raw materials and components including electronic components chemicals and biological materials no single supplier is material although for some components that require particular specifications or regulatory or other qualifications there may be a single supplier or a limited number of suppliers that can readily provide such components we utilize a number of techniques to address potential disruption in and other risks relating to our supply chain including in certain cases the use of safety stock alternative materials and qualification of multiple supply sources 

 

the majority of our products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers orders other than our instruments and related cartridges which are typically shipped within one to two weeks of receipt of an order there was no significant backlog of orders for our products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2021 for additional discussion of risks relating to supply chain and manufacturing refer to “item 1a risk factors” 

 

competition 

 

although our segments both generally operate in highly competitive markets it is difficult to determine our competitive position either in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all of the same product and service lines or serve all of the same markets as the company or any of its segments does because of the range of the products and services we sell we encounter a wide variety of competitors including a number of large global companies or divisions of such companies with substantial capabilities and resources as well a number of smaller niche competitors with specialized product offerings we have increased competition in a number of our markets as a result of the entry of new companies into certain markets the entry of competitors based in lowcost manufacturing locations and increasing consolidation in particular markets the number of competitors varies by product line key competitive factors vary among the company’s businesses but include the specific factors noted above with respect to each particular business and typically also include price quality and safety performance delivery speed application expertise service and support technology and innovation distribution network breadth of product service and software offerings and brand name recognition we believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of many of our products and our product quality for a discussion of risks related to competition refer to “item 1a risk factors”

 

seasonality of business 

 

biotechne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base particularly for the protein sciences segment a majority of diagnostics reagents division products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer consequently sales for that segment can be unpredictable and not necessarily based on seasonality as a result we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue from the diagnostics and genomics segment

 

research and development 

 

biotechne is engaged in continuous research and development in all of our major product lines we believe that our future success depends to a large extent on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs in response to the global pandemic that emerged in early 2020 we diverted some of our development resources to new and existing products to meet the needs associated with covid19 including a major effort by the development teams in our protein sciences segment to develop a diagnostic immunoassay for testing antibodies to covid19 that immunoassay product has thus far had limited sales however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

 

 

human capital 

 

through its subsidiaries biotechne employed approximately 2600 fulltime and parttime employees as of june 30 2021 of whom approximately 2000 were employed in the united states and approximately 600 outside the united states none of the united states employees are unionized outside the united states the company has governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements or work councils in certain countries 

 

biotechne is committed to attracting developing engaging and retaining the best people possible from around the world to sustain and grow our leadership position in life sciences tools and diagnostics our human capital strategy spans multiple key dimensions including the following

 

culture and governance 

 

our commitment to our people is reflected in our four epic values of empowerment passion innovation and collaboration those four values together with their 12 supporting epic behaviors are the backbone for the way we approach the leadership and direction of our work force employees are empowered to realize their potential our culture supports and encourages a collaborative approach to working with each other and with our customers we encourage innovation to continually improve our products services and processes and our passion for science and the missions of our customers is our guiding light 

 

our epic values are embedded in our culture and practices by way of example our performance management system and annual review processes incorporate our epic values each employee is measured against the behaviors and attributes that support those values to further amplify our desired behaviours we have an annual employee recognition program in which we ask for nominations and recognize winning individuals and teams form across our business who have best demonstrated our epic values during the previous year 

 

biotechne’s board of directors reviews management succession planning annually and its executive compensation committee reviews the company’s human capital strategy periodically in connection with significant initiatives and acquisitions as well as part of its oversight of our executive and equity compensation programs at the management level our vice president of human resources who reports directly to our president and ceo is responsible for the development and execution of the company’s human capital strategy

 

engagement diversity and belonging 

 

our engagement strategy focuses on developing the best workplace and best people leaders to meet our employees’ needs we believe that strong employee engagement helps enable higher retention and better business performance we assess our engagement performance through regular consultation with our managers and more formally via an annual engagement survey that assesses our employees’ overall experience

 

this feedback informs and shapes our future employeefocused initiatives these initiatives in the past have resulted in changes in programs and policies including expansion of our management and leadership development programs addition of a parental leave program expansion of our incentive programs to include annual cash bonuses to all professional employees and above introduction of flexible working and expanding the breadth of our diversity  belonging council and employee resource groups ergs

 

we believe a diverse workforce and culture of inclusion is essential to drive innovation fuel growth and help ensure our technologies and products effectively serve a global customer base the company’s executivesponsored diversity and belonging initiative is focused on providing a welcoming working environment for all employees continued education broadening our candidate pools and implementing and sustaining programs our ergs coordinated under the guidance of our executivesponsored employee resource group council offer mentorship support and engagement to help our employees including those from underrepresented groups succeed and thrive as of june 30 2021 we had 8 ergs operating globally furthermore as of june 30 2021 50 of our total employee population was female and 44 of our managerial employees were female in the united states 33 of our total employee population identified as nonwhite and 28 of our managerial employees identified as nonwhite

 

talent development and learning and development 

 

biotechne invests in people development in the belief that growing and promoting employees from within the company creates a more sustainable organization high potential and promotable employees are identified through our annual talent management program and are then equipped with a personal development and career advancement plan these plans involve training and development from internal and external programs together with mentoring and coaching

 

our global learning and development program delivers a wide range of initiatives including a validated suite of compliance training soft skills technical skills business skills interpersonal skills and career skills many of these programs are assigned to individuals specifically but in addition there is an expansive menu available to employees in order to accelerate their own development as a company that regularly acquires other businesses we believe it is important for employees to be trained in the skills and mindsets that enable them to respond positively to change this initiative allows individuals to deal with change easily and reduces the need to run large scale change management programs

 

community 

 

the company believes in giving back and in supporting the local communities in which we live and work most sites or departments engage in local charitable causes and activities in some of our sites employees are encouraged to give through regular payroll deductions and through the annual campaign week where employee contributions are matched by the company united states employees receive a paid day off to participate in local opportunities to give back to the community

 

intellectual property 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections in our terms and conditions and other salesrelated documentation

 

as of june 30 2021 we had rights to approximately 350 granted patents and approximately 250 pending patent applications in particular products in the analytical solutions and genomics divisions are protected primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents in addition certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio patent protection if granted generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant we cannot provide assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors products or services

 

in addition to pursuing patents on our products we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets particularly in the reagent solutions division of our protein sciences segment we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees consultants corporate partners and when needed our advisors see the description of risks associated with the companys intellectual property in “item 1a risk factors”

 

we can give no assurance that biotechnes products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others biotechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights biotechne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive andor nonexclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research andor diagnostics markets

 item 1a risk factors 

 

set forth below are risks and uncertainties we believe are material to our investors you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forwardlooking statements in the section titled information relating to forwardlooking statements at the beginning of this annual report on form 10k 

 

economic and industry risks 

 

conditions in the global economy the particular markets we serve and the financial markets brought about by material global crises may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

 

our global operations expose us to risks associated with many types of crises whether political social economic climate or otherwise in particular given our industry we have exposure to public health crises including epidemics and pandemics such as co vid19 most recently covid19 has had and likely will continue to have an adverse impact on our employees operations supply chains and sales and distribution systems including as a result of impacts associated with protective health measures that we other businesses and governments are taking or might have to take again in the future fo r example as the world has grappled with the covid19 pandemic many governments issued “stayathome” orders which restricted business and personal activities and many employers required employees to work from home and cease all travel while many of these travel and activity restrictions have been partially or fully lifted in certain countries where the pandemic has been controlled they may be reinstituted in the future and jurisdictions may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and other activities 

 

in the past eighteen months we have introduced new products or modified existing products to serve the research and healthcare markets as they address the global pandemic through novel diagnostic and therapeutic products the direct impact of covid19 and the preventive and precautionary measures implemented as a result thereof have adversely affected and are expected to continue to adversely affect certain elements of our company including to a different degree our operations commercial organizations supply chains and distribution systems and the future impact may be material though the impact on our different businesses and the different elements of our businesses varies please see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” for a discussion of how covid19 impacted our results of operations and financial position in fiscal 2021 without limiting the foregoing we have experienced andor may in the future experience

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

any of these developments may adversely affect our business and financial statements

 

 

us and international political economic compliance and business factors including the united kingdom ’ s recent withdrawal from the european union can negatively impact our operations and financial results 

 

changes potential changes or uncertainties in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system can adversely affect our business and financial statements for example the current us administration has continued to keep in place many of the significant tariff increases for goods imported into the united states particularly from china imposed by the prior administration congress and the us administration is also considering significant changes to healthcare in the united states including government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs

 

additionally the uk’s exit from the european union at the end of calendar year 2020 has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the uk and the eu and has disrupted the free flow of goods and people between the uk and the eu in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the uk and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the uk any of these factors have affected and could continue to adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial results particularly since our european headquarters and primary shipping facilities have been located in the uk additionally attracting and retaining qualified employees who are citizens of eu countries to our uk facilities may be more difficult given the uncertainties resulting from the uks withdrawal

 

we engage in business globally with approximately 46 of our sales revenue in fiscal 2021 coming from outside the us in addition one of our strategies is to expand geographically particularly in china india and in developing countries both through distribution and through direct operations this subjects us to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions currency fluctuations tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond our control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases

 

the application of laws and regulations impacting global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibited business conduct and damage to our reputation we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us

 

we continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with our internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by our internal policies could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties

 

the healthcare and life sciences industries that we serve face constant pressures and changes in an effort to reduce or increase the predictability of healthcare costs all of which may adversely affect our business and financial results 

 

our protein sciences segment products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions in addition to the impacts described above relating to covid19 research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies we carry essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

 

our genomics and diagnostics segment products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market which relies largely on government healthcarerelated policies and funding changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and correspondingly our sales to them for example our exosome diagnostics business develops and sells novel exosomebased diagnostic tests while we received public payer coverage for certain uses we are currently seeking expanded coverage from public payors as well as coverage decisions regarding reimbursement from additional private payers however the process and timeline for obtaining coverage decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict further reimbursement reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment such as prior authorization diagnosis code and other claims edits or a physician or qualified practitioner’s signature on test requisitions may be implemented from time to time all of these payor actions and changes may have a material adverse effect on revenue and earnings associated with our diagnostics products 

 

 

acquisition and investment risks 

 

our inability to consummate acquisitions at our historical rate and at appropriate prices and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy could negatively impact our growth rate and stock price  

 

we routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets and have completed seventeen acquisitions and investments in the last nine years our ability to grow revenues earnings and cash flow at or above our historic rates depends in part upon our ability to identify and successfully acquire and integrate businesses at appropriate prices and realize anticipated synergies and to make appropriate investments that support our longterm strategy we may not be able to consummate acquisitions at rates similar to the past which could adversely impact our growth rate and our stock price promising acquisitions and investments are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons including high valuations competition among prospective buyers or investors the availability of affordable funding in the capital markets and the need to satisfy applicable closing conditions and obtain applicable antitrust and other regulatory approvals on acceptable terms changes in accounting or regulatory requirements or instability in the credit markets could also adversely impact our ability to consummate acquisitions and investments

 

our acquisition of businesses investments joint ventures and other strategic relationships if not properly implemented or integrated could negatively impact our business and financial statements 

 

as part of our business strategy we acquire businesses make investments and enter into joint ventures and other strategic relationships in the ordinary course and we also from time to time complete more significant transactions we joined with two partners to establish a collaborative marketing venture scaleready llc to address the needs of the rapidly expanding cell and gene therapy market while we believe this joint venture provides a competitive advantage in addressing this market we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners and we may not be able to direct or influence the management and operations of the joint venture in the manner we believe is most appropriate exposing us to additional risk more generally acquisitions investments joint ventures and strategic relationships involve a number of additional financial accounting managerial operational legal compliance and other risks and challenges including but not limited to the following any of which could adversely affect our business and our financial statements

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired which could negatively impact our financial statements or stock price 

 

we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment and declines in the financial condition of our business we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired any such charge would adversely impact our financial results

 

in addition the companys expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected for example the company has an approximate 2 equity investment in publicly traded chemocentryx inc nasdaq ccxi that is valued at 200 million as of june 30 2021 the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares

 

 

 

strategic and operational risks 

 

our success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel and creating and maintaining a culture that includes the employees joining through acquisition 

 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production sales and marketing and management personnel are critical to our success our anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel in general we have been experiencing turnover at higher rates than usual and have had some difficulties filling certain positions in particular we operate in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong making employee retention even more challenging for example some of our fastest growing businesses are located in california and massachusetts both of which generally have low unemployment and a competitive environment for finding and retaining talent our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees as we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing finally as the geographies in which we operate recover from the recent pandemic and we return employees who had been working from home back to our sites we may not be able to retain people who prefer continuing to work from home the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business

 

our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization of new and enhanced products and services that meet our customers ’ needs our growth can also be negatively impacted if our customers do not grow as anticipated 

 

we generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introductions and new market entrants and competitors if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced products and services on a timely basis our offerings will become obsolete over time and our business and financial statements will suffer our success will depend on several factors including our ability to

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue which would adversely affect our business and financial statements even when we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products we often incur substantial costs in doing so and our profitability may suffer

 

we face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively we may experience decreased demand and decreased market share or need to reduce prices to remain competitive 

 

we face intense competition across most of our product lines competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than us in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on us moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in china india and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets in order to compete effectively we must retain longstanding relationships with major customers and continue to grow our business by establishing relationships with new customers continually developing new products and services to maintain and expand our brand recognition and leadership position in various product and service categories and penetrating new markets including highgrowth markets our ability to compete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements for example increased demand for more environmentallyfriendly products and supplier practices our failure to compete effectively andor pricing pressures resulting from competition may adversely impact our business and financial statements and our expansion into new markets may result in greaterthanexpected risks liabilities and expenses

 

 

a significant disruption in or breach of security of our information technology systems or data or violation of data privacy laws could result in damage to our reputation data integrity andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits under data privacy or other laws or contractual requirements 

 

the integrity and protection of our own data and that of our customers and employees is critical to our business we rely on information technology systems some of which are provided andor managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees customers other business partners and patients and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities such as receiving and fulfilling orders billing collecting and making payments shipping products providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations these systems products and services including those we acquire through business acquisitions can be damaged disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers computer viruses ransomware human error or malfeasance power outages hardware failures telecommunication or utility failures catastrophes or other unforeseen events and in any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate attacks can also target hardware software and information installed stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into thirdparty products facilities or infrastructure security breaches of systems provided or enabled by us regardless of whether the breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our products or services or security breaches of third party systems we rely on to process store or transmit electronic information can result in the misappropriation destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees partners customers patients or suppliers these attacks breaches misappropriations and other disruptions and damage can interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners delay production and shipments result in theft of our and our customers’ intellectual property and trade secrets result in disclosure of personally identifiable information damage customer patient business partner and employee relationships and our reputation and result in defective products or services legal claims and proceedings liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation in each case resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial statements

 

in addition our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology evolving legal and regulatory standards evolving customer expectations changes in the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully maintain enhance and upgrade our systems as necessary to effectively address these requirements

 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states certain of our businesses are subject to hipaa entities that are found to be in violation of hipaa as the result of a breach of unsecured patient health information a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the hhs may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative fines and penalties andor additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with hhs to settle allegations of hipaa noncompliance individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy most notably in the last several years some states including california and virginia have passed broad privacy legislation that could result in more material impacts as implementing regulations are issued european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe failure to comply with the requirements of gdpr and the applicable national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines of up to €20 million or up to 4 of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher and other administrative penalties several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements

 

if we suffer loss to our facilities supply chains distribution systems or information technology systems due to catastrophe or other events our operations could be seriously harmed 

 

our facilities supply chains distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane power shortage or outage public health crisis including epidemics and pandemics and the reaction thereto war terrorism riot or other natural or manmade disasters such as the covid19 pandemic if any of these facilities supply chains or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operations delay production and shipments result in defective products or services diminish demand damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal exposure and significant repair or replacement expenses the thirdparty insurance coverage that we maintain varies from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decisions regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against such losses

 

 

the manufacture of many of our products is a complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problems manufacturing products our business and financial statements could suffer 

 

the manufacture of many of our products is a complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirements for some of our products problems can arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocols and procedures problems with reliable sourcing of raw materials or components natural disasters and environmental factors and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recalls and product liability exposure because of the quality requirements of some of our customers as well as stringent regulations of the fda and similar agencies regarding the manufacture of certain of our products alternative manufacturing or sourcing is not always available on a timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problems could result in significant adverse impacts to our business and financial statements

 

if we cannot adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchases required for our manufacturing activities to reflect changes in market conditions and customer demand our business and financial statements may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited sources of supply for certain materials components and services can cause production interruptions delays and inefficiencies 

 

we purchase materials components and equipment from third parties for use in many of our manufacturing operations our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect changes in customer demand and market fluctuations including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during a market upturn suppliers from time to time extend lead times limit supplies or increase prices if we cannot purchase sufficient products at competitive prices and quality and on a timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipments may be delayed our costs may increase or we may breach our contractual commitments and incur liabilities conversely in order to secure supplies for the production of products we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitments with vendors which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demands if demand for our products is less than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges and our business and financial statements may suffer

 

in addition some of our businesses purchase certain requirements from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of quality assurance regulatory requirements cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other suppliers encounter financial operating or other difficulties or if our relationship with them changes we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply the supply chains for our businesses can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraints bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reasons decreased availability of key raw materials or commodities and external events such as natural disasters pandemic health issues war terrorist actions governmental actions such as trade protectionism and legislative or regulatory changes any of these factors can result in production interruptions delays extended lead times and inefficiencies because we cannot always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to changing market conditions at times our manufacturing capacity exceeds or falls short of our production requirements any or all of these problems can result in the loss of customers provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements

 

 

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products which if disrupted could materially impair our business operations our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites 

 

the companys internal quality control packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the companys sales since certain company products must comply with fda regulations and because in all instances the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while we have taken certain steps to manage these operational risks the companys future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions

 

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

 

defects and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our products or allegations thereof can adversely affect our business and financial statements 

 

certain of our products and services are sold for use in diagnostics for those products and services in particular manufacturing or design defects in unanticipated use of safety or quality issues or the perception of such issues with respect to “off label” use of or inadequate disclosure of risks relating to the use of products and services that we make or sell including items that we source from thirdparties can lead to personal injury death andor property damage and adversely affect our business and financial statements these events can lead to recalls or safety alerts result in the removal of a product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claims being brought against us recalls removals and product liability and similar claims regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome result in significant costs as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services our business can also be affected by studies of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device products and components that are conducted by industry participants government agencies and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such products in one or more countries and give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of product issues including claims by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

 

most of our reagent products need to be stored and shipped at certain cold temperatures consequently we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers by express mail or air delivery through package delivery companies such as fedex in the us and dhl in europe if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

 

 

intellectual property risks 

 

we are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or if third parties infringe our intellectual property rights we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights 

 

many of the markets we serve are technologydriven and as a result intellectual property rights play a significant role in product development and differentiation we own numerous patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property and licenses to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property rights that we obtain however are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide us a significant competitive advantage and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us in addition the steps that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designedaround or becoming subject to compulsory licensing in some circumstances enforcement is not available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights

 

these risks are particularly pronounced in countries in which we do business that do not have levels of protection of corporate proprietary information intellectual property technology and other assets comparable to the united states we operate globally with manufacturing operations in china and the uk and approximately 46 of our revenue from outside the united states the laws regulations and enforcement mechanisms in other countries may in some cases be less protective of our intellectual property rights our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights can adversely impact our business and financial statements

 

we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope coverage and validity of others proprietary rights or to defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement any of which could be timeintensive and costly and may adversely impact our business 

 

our success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate we have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties

 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert managements focus from other business concerns if we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others we could be required to cease certain activities alter our products or processes or pay licensing fees this could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent we may be unable to sell some of our products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if we do not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect our earnings

 

 

financial and tax risks 

 

we have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility and we may incur additional debt in the future the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy 

 

we currently have a credit agreement that provides for a revolving credit facility of 600 million which can be increased by an additional 200 million subject to certain conditions and a term loan of 250 million borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of august 20 2021 the company had drawn 335 million under the credit agreement

 

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as

 

  

  

  

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions

 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends

 

our business and financial statements can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rates changes in our tax rates and tax liabilities and assessments including as a result of changes in tax laws 

 

international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in fiscal 2021 currency translation had an unfavorable effect of 52 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services

 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act which became effective in late 2017 which included broad and complex changes to the united states tax code interpretations assumptions and guidance regarding the tax act that have been issued subsequently have had a material impact on our effective tax rate and we anticipate that there may be additional changes to the us tax code under a new administration

 

in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

for many years our board has declared quarterly dividends ranging from of 025 to 032 cents per share in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

 

 

legal regulatory compliance and reputational risks 

 

our business is subject to extensive regulation failure to comply with these regulations could adversely affect our business and financial results  

 

as referenced in more detail above we and our customers must comply with a wide array of federal state local and international regulations in such areas as medical device healthcare import and export anticorruption and privacy we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs and diagnostic products changes in the us fda’s regulation of drug or medical device products could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products

 

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the us and elsewhere and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the governme nt less than 2 of our fiscal 2021 sa les were made to the us federal government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 

we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the us fda the us drug enforcement agency the dea the us department of health and human services the dhhs and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale the manufacture distribution and marketing of many of our products and services including medical devices and pharma services are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea and other equivalent local state federal and nonus regulatory authorities in addition we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities for example the eu has adopted the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostic medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently approved in vitro diagnostics medical devices have until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr complying with eu ivdr the regulation applicable to the company requires material modifications to our quality management systems additional resources in certain functions updates to technical files and additional clinical data in some cases among other changes failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of the eu ivdr or other requirements imposed by these or similar regulatory authorities including without limitation remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs any or all of which could be significant we are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers ability to provide products to their customers

 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticompetition laws any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

significant developments or changes in us laws or policies including changes in us trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto can have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements 

 

significant developments or changes in us laws and policies including as a result of the new us administration such as laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system and drug prices can adversely affect our business and financial statements for example the previous us administration increased tariffs on certain goods imported into the united states and trade tensions between the united states and china escalated with each country imposing significant additional tariffs on a wide range of goods imported from the other country the us and china could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions which could affect our access to markets these factors have adversely affected and in the future could further adversely affect our business and financial statements

 

our business and financial statements can be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees agents or business partners 

 

we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems including our code of ethics and business conduct protect us from acts committed by employees agents or business partners of ours or of businesses we acquire or partner with that violate us andor nonus laws including the laws governing payments to government officials bribery fraud kickbacks and false claims pricing sales and marketing practices conflicts of interest competition employment practices and workplace behavior export and import compliance economic and trade sanctions money laundering and data privacy in particular the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar antibribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the united states and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees in addition the government may seek to hold us liable for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire we also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier code of conduct and material violations of such code of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business and financial statements

 

 

certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the us fda and by comparable agencies of other countries as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements 

 

certain of our products are medical devices diagnostics tests and other products that are subject to regulation by the us fda or state clia regulations by other federal and state governmental agencies by comparable agencies of other countries and regions and by regulations governing hazardous materials and drugsof abuse or the manufacture and sale of products containing any such materials the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent and unpredictable several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded or plan to expand their existing regulations including implementation of ivdr regulations in europe failure to meet these requirements adversely impacts our business and financial statements in the applicable geographies

 

government authorities may conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations agency guidance or case law failure to obtain required regulatory clearances before marketing our products or before implementing modifications to or promoting additional indications or uses of our products other violations of laws or regulations failure to remediate inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities real or perceived efficacy or safety concerns or trends of adverse events with respect to our products even after obtaining clearance for distribution and unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials can lead to fda form 483 inspectional observations warning letters notices to customers declining sales loss of customers loss of market share remediation and increased compliance costs recalls seizures of adulterated or misbranded products fines expenses injunctions civil penalties criminal penalties consent decrees administrative detentions refusals to permit importations partial or total shutdown of production facilities or the implementation of operating restrictions narrowing of permitted uses for a product refusal of the government to grant 510k clearance suspension or withdrawal of approvals premarket notification rescissions and other adverse effects further defending against any such actions can be costly and timeconsuming and may require significant personnel resources therefore even if we are successful in defending against any such actions brought against us our business may be impaired ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs

 

more specifically as a healthcare provider the company’s exosome diagnostics’ exodx prostate business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal state and local levels in the us and other countries where it operates the company’s failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians hospitals and health systems could lead to civil and criminal penalties exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possibly prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position such occurrences regardless of their outcome could damage the company’s reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties 

 

failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines penalties and damage to the company ’ s reputation and have a material adverse effect upon the company ’ s business a risk that has been elevated with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics whose laboratory testing service is a healthcare provider that obtains and uses protected health information 

 

if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information it could be subject to monetary fines civil penalties or criminal sanctions in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa privacy and security regulations including the expanded requirements under us health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information phi by covered entities in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and security of phi hipaa restricts the company’s ability to use or disclose phi without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations if the laboratory operations for the company’s business use or disclose phi improperly under these privacy regulations they may incur significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties

overall results 

 

operational update 

 

for fiscal 2021 consolidated net sales increased 26 as compared to fiscal 2020 organic growth was 22 with currency translation and acquisitions having a 3 and 1 impact on revenue respectively organic revenue growth was broad based and driven by accelerated momentum of the companys longterm growth strategy as well as customer site closures in the latter half of fiscal 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic 

 

for fiscal 2021 consolidated earnings including noncontrolling interest decreas ed 39 com pared to fiscal 2020 the decrease in earnings was primarily due to a nonoperating loss of approximately  679 million on our chemocentryx investment compared to a gain on investment of 137 million in the last fiscal year after adjusting for acquisition related costs intangibles amortization stockbased compensation restructuring costs the loss on investment certain income tax items in both years and noncontrolling interest adjusted net earnings increased 52  in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings growth was driven by volume leverage operational productivity and product mix

 

for fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales increased 4 as compared to fiscal 2019 organic growth was 4 with currency translation and acquisitions having an immaterial impact on revenue the company experienced broadbased organic revenue growth in most major geographic regions and endmarkets prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic this broadbased organic growth was partially offset by the negative impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic experienced by the company in the latter half of fiscal year 2020 

 

for fiscal 2020 consolidated earnings including noncontrolling interest increased 139 compared to fiscal 2019 the increase in earnings was primarily due to a nonoperating gain of approximately 137 million on our chemocentryx investment and a gain of approximately 7 million on the settlement of the escrow balance associated with the exosome acquisition after adjusting for acquisition related costs stockbased compensation and certain income tax items in both years adjusted net earnings increased 2 in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings growth was driven by volume leverage which was partially offset by business impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic 

 

 

covid19 business update 

 

the global spread of covid19 in the past 18 months has led to unprecedented restrictions on and disruptions in business and personal activities including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we other businesses our communities and governments have taken and are taking to mitigate the spread of the virus and to manage its impact while a number of vaccines developed in response to the pandemic appear to be effective in mitigating spread of the disease we continue to actively monitor the pandemic on a global scale we have taken and intend to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on and risks to our business including but not limited to our employees customers business partners manufacturing capabilities and capacity and supply and distribution channels posed by the spread of covid19 and the governmental and community responses thereto

 

the company has responded to the pandemic by leveraging our deep product portfolio and scientific expertise to develop robust covid19 product and service offerings providing critical support for both clinical care and therapeutic development while our sales related to covid19 specific products have been modest fiscal 2021 growth benefited from the reopening of customer sites initially closed in the latter half of fiscal 2021 and our ongoing efforts to utilize our portfolio of products and services to enable solutions for this evolving pandemic

 

we are unable to forecast the impact of covid19 on future revenue given the uncertainty that some customer sites may close again due to increases in covid19 cases occurring in their region and over the duration of the covid19 pandemic especially if current vaccines prove to be ineffective against new strains of the coronavirus that may develop over time we anticipate a positive longterm outlook for sales growth resulting from expected future funding increases within lifescience research in response to the current pandemic similar to current periods we anticipate the impact on eps to be similar to that of sales growth

 

the company remains in a strong financial position with sufficient available cash as well as access to additional funding if necessary through our longterm debt agreement we did not experience any material changes to our june 30 2021 nor our june 30 2020 balance sheet resulting from covid19 for items such as additional reserves or asset impairments resulting from the pandemic

 

the company has remained fully operational as we abided by local covid19 safety regulations across the world this past year as the pandemic has eased in most locations we will be returning all employees to on site work although in certain instances we will continue to operate with appropriate safety measures including staggered shifts social distancing and hygiene best practices recommended by public health officials in addition the company has taken and will continue to take additional steps to monitor and strengthen our supply chain to maintain an uninterrupted supply of our critical products and services

in fiscal 2021 protein sciences segment net sales increased 27 compared to fiscal 2020 organic growth for the segment was 24 for the fiscal year with foreign currency translation having a favorable impact of 3 and acquisitions contributing an immaterial amount 

 

overall segment growth was driven by continued market acceptance of our portfolio of productivity enhancing solutions across endmarkets and geographies combined with the reopening of customer sites that were closed in the latter half of fiscal 2020 due to covid19 

 

in fiscal 2021 diagnostics and genomics segment net sales increa sed 23 compared to fiscal 2020 organic growth was 18 with acquisitions and foreign currency having a favorable impact of 4 and 1 impact on revenue respectively

in fiscal 2020 diagnostics and genomics segment net sales increased 8 compared to fiscal 2019 organic growth was 8 with acquisitions and foreign currency having an immaterial impact on revenue

 

overall segment revenue growth was driven by strong performance in our exodx prostate test rnascope hematology and assay development products lines prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic the closure of academic site labs and limitation of nonessential medical procedures resulting from the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted sales of our rnascope product line and our exodx prostate test respectively in the latter portion of the fiscal year these negative sales impacts were partially offset through growth in supplying specialty diagnostic antibodies and other raw materials to covid19 testing manufacturers

 

 

gross margins 

 

consolidated gross margins were 680 654 and 663 in fiscal 2021 2020 and 2019 consolidated gross margins were positively impacted as a result of broad based revenue growth and cost management excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold amortization of intangibles and stock compensation expense adjusted gross margins were 722 703 and 715 in fisca l 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively fiscal 2021 adjusted gross margin was positively impacted by volume leverage and product mix when compared to fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019

 

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales is as follows

 

  

fluctuations in adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net sales have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix we expect that in the future gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions

 

management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company’s two segments segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were as follows 

 

  

the changes in the protein sciences segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 and 2019 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales within the segment 

 

the increase in diagnostics and genomics in gross margin for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to volume leverage the increase in diagnostics and genomics in gross margin for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to volume leverage operational productivity and revenue growth against a similar cost base in recent acquisitions 

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 644 million 25 in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to investments made by the company to support volume growth within each of the segments as well as additional expenses related to the acquisition of asuragen inc 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 38 million 1 in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in corporate expenses and a gain resulting from a settlement of amounts held in escrow from the exosomedx acquisition between the company and the former shareholders these reductions to our selling general and administrative expenses were partially offset by an increase in expense within the segments

critical accounting policies 

 

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 

business combinations 

 

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition the calculations used to determine the fair value of the longlived assets acquired primarily intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgment we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including but not limited to the nature of the acquired company’s business its competitive position strengths and challenges its historical financial position and performance estimated customer retention rates discount rates and future plans for the combined entity we may also engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired longlived assets

 

the fair value of acquired technology is generally the primary asset identified and therefore estimated using the multiperiod excess earnings method the multiperiod excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets such as trade names and inprocess research and development that contributed to the generation of the cash flows the resulting cash flow which is attributable solely to the primary asset acquired is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value the trade name is generally calculated using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings inprocess research and development assets are valued using the multiperiod excess earnings method when the cash flows from the inprocess research and development assets are separately identifiable from the primary asset in circumstances that customer relationship assets are identified that are not the primary asset they are valued using the distributor model income approach which isolates revenues and cash flow associated with the sales and distribution function of the entity and attributable to customerrelated assets which are then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value 

 

we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made for potential payments related to financial performance based milestones projected revenue andor ebitda amounts volatility and discount rates assumptions are included in the estimated amounts for potential payments related to product development milestones the fair value is based on the probability of achievement of such milestones the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis

 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets which determines the amount of acquisitionrelated amortization expense we will record in future periods each reporting period we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization

 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings

 

the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income for example different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ consequently to the extent a longerlived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorterlived asset net income in a given period may be higher additionally assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill as goodwill is not amortized this would benefit net income in a given period although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis

 

impairment of goodwill 

 

goodwill 

 

goodwill was 8431 million as of june 30 2021 which represented 373 of total assets goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment 

 

to analyze goodwill for impairment we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments which considers among other things the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics we periodically review o ur reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business

 

there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1 2002

 

2021   goodwill impairment analyses 

 

in completing our 2021 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for each of our five reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 201704 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

 

because our 2021 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units the summation of our reporting units fair values as indicated by our discounted cash flow calculations were compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

 

the quantitative assessment completed as of april 1 2021 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom accordingly the company determined there was no indication of impairment of goodwill in our annual goodwill impairment analysis further no triggering events were identified in the year ended june 30 2021 that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment beyond our required annual goodwill impairment assessment

 

2020   goodwill impairment analyses 

 

in completing our 2020 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 201704 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

 

because our 2020 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units the summation of our reporting units fair values as indicated by our discounted cash flow calculations were compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

 

the quantitative assessment completed as of april 1 2020 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom accordingly the company determined there was no indication of impairment of goodwill in our annual goodwill impairment analysis further no triggering events were identified in the year ended june 30 2020 that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment beyond our required annual goodwill impairment assessment

 

2019   goodwill impairment analyses 

 

at the beginning of the quarter ended march 31 2019 the company realigned the management of certain business processes between reporting units within the same segment a goodwill allocation was performed between the impacted reporting units based on the relative fair value of the processes realigned in conjunction with the realignment a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed both prior to and subsequent to the realignment the quantitative impairment assessments performed utilized a consistent process with our fiscal 2021 quantitative goodwill impairment assessment described above the quantitative assessment indicated that all of the impacted reporting units had substantial headroom both prior to and subsequent to the realignment this impairment assessment performed was sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

 

in conducting our annual goodwill impairment test as of april 1 2019 we elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether changes in events or circumstances since our most recent quantitative test for goodwill impairment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on its annual analysis the company determined there was no indication of impairment of goodwill

nongaap financial measures 

 

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap these nongaap measures include

 

  

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results we use these nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions including with respect to incentive compensation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for periodtoperiod comparison of results

 

our nongaap financial measure of organic growth represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceeding 12 months as well as the impact of foreign currency excluding these measures provides more useful periodtoperiod comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which can vary significantly from period to period and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period

 

our nongaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis exclude stockbased compensation the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory amortization of acquisition intangibles acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration and other nonrecurring items including nonrecurring costs and gains stockbased compensation is excluded from nongaap adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge specifically the varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions variety of award types and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets purchase accounting adjustments including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisitionrelated expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value contingent consideration and other nonrecurring items including gains or losses on legal settlements and onetime assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events and are not reflective of our internal investments the costs of developing producing supporting and selling our products and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure additionally these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity

 

the company’s nongaap adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis also excludes stockbased compensation expense which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards restructuring impairments of equity method investments gain and losses from investments and certain adjustments to income tax expense impairments of equity investments are excluded as they are not part of our daytoday operating decisions additionally gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded costs related to restructuring activities including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs the company independently calculates a nongaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified nongaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments in addition the tax impact of other discrete and nonrecurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings we believe these tax items can significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs andor income associated with historical trends and future results

 

the company periodically reassesses the components of our nongaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance changes in how we make financial and operational decisions and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful

 

readers are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the company to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures provided within the companys consolidated financial statements

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures 

about market risk

during our fiscal year 2020 we operated under two operating segments – our protein sciences segment and our diagnostics and genomics segment our protein sciences segment is a leading developer and manufacturer of highquality purified proteins and reagent solutions most notably cytokines and growth factors antibodies immunoassays biologically active small molecule compounds tissue culture reagents and tcell activation technologies this segment also includes protein analysis solutions that offer researchers efficient and streamlined options for automated western blot and multiplexed elisa workflow our diagnostics and genomics segment develops and manufactures diagnostic products including fdaregulated controls calibrators blood gas and clinical chemistry controls and other reagents for oem and clinical customers as well as a portfolio of exosomal based molecular diagnostic assays including the exodx® prostateintelliscore test epi for prostate cancer diagnosis this segment also manufactures and sells advanced tissuebased insitu hybridization assays ish for research and clinical use 

 

we are a minnesota corporation with our global headquarters in minneapolis minnesota we were founded over forty years ago in 1976 as research and diagnostic systems inc we became a publicly traded company in 1985 through a merger with techne corporation now biotechne corporation our common stock is listed on the nasdaq under the symbol “tech” we operate globally with offices in many locations throughout north america europe and asia today our product lines extend to over 300000 products most of which we manufacture ourselves in multiple locations in north america as well as england and china

 

our historical focus was on providing high quality proteins antibodies and immunoassays to the life science research market and hematology controls to the diagnostics market over the last seven years we have been implementing a disciplined strategy to accelerate growth in part by acquiring businesses and product portfolios that leveraged and diversified our existing product lines filled portfolio gaps with differentiated high growth businesses and expanded our geographic scope from fiscal years 2013 through 2020 we have acquired sixteen companies that have expanded the product offerings and geographic footprint of both operating segments recognizing the importance of an integrated global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our strategies we have maintained many of the brands of the companies we have acquired but unified under a single global brand  biotechne 

 

  

our products and markets 

 

in fiscal 2020 net sales from biotechne’s protein sciences and diagnostics and genomics segments represented 75 and 25 of consolidated net sales respectively financial information relating to biotechne’s segments is incorporated herein by reference to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 

protein sciences segment 

 

the protein sciences segment is comprised of divisions with complementary product offerings serving many of the same customers – the reagent solutions division and the analytical solutions division

 

protein sciences segment products 

 

the reagent solutions division consists of specialized proteins such as cytokines and growth factors antibodies small molecules tissue culture sera and cell selection technologies traditionally used by researchers to further their life science experimental activities and by companies dev eloping next generation diagnostics and therapeutics especially companies developing cell and genebased therapeutics key product brands include rd systems tocris biosciences and novus biologicals in 2019 we acquired quad technologies which has novel quickgel™ technologies for cell separation and activation and bmogen technologies which has a nonviral transposonbased technology for gene editing called tcbuster a key technology targeted for the cell and gene therapy market we have now leveraged these and other products we have or are developing in combination with two additional companies wilson wolf and fresenius kabi to provide a more complete offering for the cell and gene therapy market our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides high quality tools that customers can use in solving the complex biological pathways and glean knowledge that may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to address different p athologies

 

the analytical solutions division includes manual and automated protein analysis instruments and immunoassays that are used in quantifying proteins in a variety of biological fluids products in this division include traditional manual platebased immunoassays fully automated multiplex immunoassays on various instrument platforms and automated western blotting and isoelectric focusing analysis of complex protein samples key product brands include rd systems and proteinsimple a number of our products have been demonstrated to have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including cancer autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation neurological disorders and kidney failure immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics in fact we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for a few of our immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices most recently in collaboration with mount sinai hospital and its commercial entity kantaro biosciences we relied on that expertise to rapidly develop and commercialize an immunoassay kit intended to test for antibodies to covid19

 

protein sciences segment customers and distribution methods 

 

our customers for this segment include researchers in academia government and industry chiefly pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as diagnosticcompanion diagnostic and therapeutic customers especially customers engaged in the development of cell and gene based therapies our biologics line of products in the analytical solutions division is used primarily by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies we sell our products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china we have a sales and marketing partnership agreement with fisher scientific that supports our market presence in north america and leverages the transactional efficiencies offered by the large fisher organization we also sell through third party distributors in china japan certain eastern european countries and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of the protein sciences segments net sales during fiscal 2020 2019 or 2018

 

 

protein sciences segment competitors 

 

with respect to the reagent solutions division of this segment a number of large companies supply the worldwide market for proteinrelated and chemicallybased research and diagnostic reagents including bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc peprotech inc abcam plc and thermo fisher scientific inc as well as a number of smaller niche competitors market success is primarily dependent upon product innovation and quality selection of products price and reputation we believe we are one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine and growth factors in the research market we further believe that the expansion of our product offering the recognized quality of our products and the ability to continue to bring novel cutting edge products and solutions to the market will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research diagnostic and therapeutics markets our analytical solutions division has a number of similar competitors our simple western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional manual western blotting technique as a result we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional western blot users these competitors include biorad laboratories merck kgaa perkinelmer and thermo fisher scientific all of these vendors provide elements of the traditional work flow similarly our simpleplex platform replaces the traditional manual elisa assay and introduces an automated multiplex immunoassay feature competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for elisas including meso scale discovery perkinelmer thermo fisher luminex millipore molecular devices tecan biotek quanterix and biorad laboratories the primary competitors for our biologics instrumentation are agilent technologies danaher and perkinelmer as well as shimadzu thermo fisher and waters we believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality

 

protein sciences segment manufacturing 

  

we are not dependent on key or sole source suppliers for most of our products in the protein sciences segment we develop and manufacture the majority of our proteins using recombinant dna technology thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources our antibodies are produced using a variety of technologies including traditional animal immunization and hybridoma technology as well as recombinant antibody techniques our chemicalbased small molecule products are synthesized from widely available products

 

we manufacture our analytical solutions division instrumentation products for this segment at various locations in the united states and canada we manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables components subassemblies and autosamplers used with or included in our systems which are manufactured to our specifications as with other products sold in this segment we are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers we conduct all final testing and inspection of our products we have established a quality control program including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures all of our protein sciences segment manufacturing sites are iso 9001 or iso 13485 certified or are in the process of being iso certified

 

the majority of our reagent solutions division products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers orders while most of our analytical solutions products are shipped within one to two weeks of receipt of an order

 

there was no significant backlog of orders for our protein sciences segment products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2019

 

diagnostic s and genomics segment 

 

the diagnostics and genomics segment also includes two divisions focused primarily in the diagnostics market – the diagnostics reagents division and the genomics division

 

diagnostics and genomics segment products 

  

the diagnostic reagents division consists of regulated products traditionally used as calibrators and controls in the clinical setting also included are instrument and process control products for hematology blood chemistry blood gases coagulation controls and reagents used in various diagnostic applications often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis tailored to a customers specific diagnostic assay technology we supply these reagents in various formats including liquid frozen or in lyophilized form most of these products are sold on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis to instrument manufacturers with most products being fdacleared

 

the genomics division includes products aimed at nucleic acid rna or dna analysis that can be used for diagnostic or research applications key product brands include advanced cell diagnostics or acd and exosome diagnostics acd products are aimed at rna analysis of tissue while exosome diagnostics focuses on exosomebased liquid biopsy techniques that analyze genes or their transcripts the first commercialized test from exosome diagnostics is a urinebased assay for early detection of highgrade prostate cancer used as an aid in deciding the need for an initial biopsy

 

 

diagnostics and genomics segment customers and distribution methods 

  

the majority of diagnostic reagents divisions sales are through oem agreements but we sell some of our diagnostics reagents products directly to customers and in europe and asia also through distributors the customers for the acd research products include researchers in academia as well as investigators in pharmaceutical and biotech companies we sell our products directly to those customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china and through distributors elsewhere in addition to being useful research tools our rna in situ hybridization assays have diagnostics applications as well and several are currently under review by the fda in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies in the united states we offer test services to physicians using our labdeveloped noninvasive urinebased assay for prostate cancer detection our diagnostic laboratory is certified under and regulated by the state of massachusetts pursuant to the clinical laboratory improvement amendments or clia customers are physicians prescribing such tests for their patients

 

no customers accounted for 10 or more of the reporting segments consolidated net sales during fiscal years 2020 2019 or 2018

  

diagnostics and genomics segment competitors 

 

in the diagnostics reagents division the competitors for our hematology controls product line include danaher beckman coulter and streck for our other control and calibrator products sold in this division the principal competitors are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation we compete based primarily on product performance quality and price in this division seracare hytest ltd and thermo fisher scientific are additional competitors in the clinical diagnostic manufacturing and reagents markets

 

competitors in the genomics division are varied depending on the product line while there are not any direct competitors for the rnabased in situ hybridization products sold under the acd brand they are intended to be an alternative to immunohistochemistry assays and pcrbased diagnostic tests in certain circumstances the noninvasive urinebased assay offered under our exosome diagnostics brand and used for prostate cancer biopsy decisions is supplemental to bloodbased prostatespecific antigen psa tests and is competitive with some other companies that offer liquid biopsybased alternatives such as 4kscore offered by opko health and selectmdx offered by mdxhealth

 

diagnostics and genomics segment manufacturing 

 

the primary raw material for our hematology controls products is whole blood we purchase human blood from commercial blood banks and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business thus far other controls are derived from various bodily fluids or cells from different animal species which are then processed inhouse to isolate the product of interest or from other bulk reagent suppliers that specialize in certain products our other reagent products are manufactured using a variety of suppliers with no supplier representing a material portion of our business

 

most of the hematology controls products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule however most of our business in this segment come from large orders shipped based on our customers needs we are highly dependent on our customers’ demand and inventory controls consequently our revenues can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year

 

our genomics division products and services are all synthesized from widely available products we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in this division 

 

there was no significant backlog of orders for our diagnostics and genomics segment as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2019

 

 

the following discussion includes information common to both of the company’s segments 

 

geographic information 

 

following is financial information relating to geographic areas in thousands 

 

  

  

net sales are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer or distributor longlived assets are comprised of land buildings and improvements and equipment net of accumulated depreciation see the description of risks associated with the companys foreign subsidiaries in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

 

 

 

  

products under development 

 

biotechne is engaged in continuous research and development in all of our major product lines we believe that our future success depends to a large extent on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs in response to the global pandemic that emerged in early 2020 we diverted some of our development resources to new and existing products to meet the needs associated with covid19 including a major effort by the development teams in our protein sciences segment to develop a diagnostic immunoassay for testing antibodies to covid19 however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

 

 

  

intellectual property 

 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections

 

as of june 30 2020 we had rights to 258 granted patents and approximately 225 pending patent applications in particular products in the analytical solutions and genomics divisions are protected primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents in addition certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio patent protection if granted generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant we cannot provide assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors products or services

 

in addition to pursuing patents on our products we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets particularly in the reagent solutions division of our protein sciences segment we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees consultants corporate partners and when needed our advisors see the description of risks associated with the companys intellectual property in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 

we can give no assurance that biotechnes products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others biotechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights biotechne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive andor nonexclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research andor diagnostics markets

 

biotechne has obtained trademark registration in certain countries for certain of its brand and product names biotechne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered

 

 

seasonality of business 

 

biotechne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base particularly for the protein sciences segment a majority of diagnostics reagents division products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer consequently sales for that segment can be unpredictable and not necessarily based on seasonality as a result we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue from this segment

 

laws and regulations 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex laws and regulations governing the production marketing handling transportation and distribution of our products and services the following sections describe certain significant regulations pertinent to the company these are not the only regulations that the company’s business for a description of risks related to laws and regulations to which we are subject refer to item 1a risk factors”

 

medical device regulations and other healthcare laws 

 

a number of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws rules regulations selfregulatory codes and orders including but not limited to the us food drug and cosmetic act the “fdca” the fdca requires these products when sold in the united states to be safe and effective for their intended uses and to comply with the regulations administered by the us food and drug administration “fda” the fda regulates the design development testing manufacture advertising labeling packaging marketing distribution import and export and record keeping for such products many medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in nonus countries in which they are produced or sold

 

any medical devices we manufacture and distribute are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda and certain state and nonus agencies as a medical device manufacturer our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection on a routine basis by the fda we are required to adhere to the current good manufacturing practices “cgmp” requirements as set forth in the quality systems regulation “qsr” which require manufacturers including thirdparty manufacturers to follow stringent design testing control documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all phases of the design and manufacturing process

 

we must also comply with postmarket surveillance regulations including medical device reporting or mdr requirements which require that we review and report to the fda any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury we must also report any incident in which our product has malfunctioned if that malfunction would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury it if were to recur

 

labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and in certain circumstances by the federal trade commission medical devices approved or cleared by the fda may not be promoted for unapproved or uncleared uses otherwise known as “offlabel” promotion the fda and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of offlabel uses

 

in the european union “eu” our products are subject to the medical device laws of the various member states which are currently based on a directive of the european commission however the eu has adopted the eu medical device regulation the “eu mdr” and the in vitro diagnostic regulation the “eu ivdr” each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements quality systems and postmarket surveillance manufacturers of currently approved medical devices had until may 2020 to meet the requirements of the eu mdr and until may 2022 to meet the eu ivdr complying with the eu mdr and eu ivdr requires modifications to our quality management systems additional resources in certain functions and updates to technical files among other changes

 

one of our products under our exosome diagnostics brand is offered as a test under a cliacertified laboratory consequently we must comply with governmental regulations relating to all elements of our sales marketing billing practices and financial relationships with physicians hospitals and health systems

 

data privacy and security laws 

 

as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain controls to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information individual states also regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy in particular there is a new broad privacy law in california the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” which came into effect in january 2020 the ccpa has some of the same features as the gdpr discussed below and has already prompted several other states to follow with similar laws the eu general data protection regulation that became effective in may 2018 “gdpr” has imposed significantly stricter requirements in how we collect transmit process and retain personal data including among other things in certain circumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities and prompt notice to data subjects with significant fines for noncompliance several other countries such as china and russia have passed and other countries are considering passing laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions

 

other laws and regulations governing our sales marketing and shipping activities 

 

we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act and various other similar anticorruption and antibribery acts which are particularly relevant to our operations in countries where the customers are government entities or are controlled by government officials both we directly and indirectly through our distributors must comply with such laws when interacting with those entities

 

as biotechne’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 

 

employee relations 

 

through its subsidiaries biotechne employed approximately 2300 fulltime and parttime employees as of june 30 2020 none of the united states employees are unionized outside the united states the company has governmentmandated collective bargaining arrangements or work councils in certain countries 

 

  investor information 

 

we are subject to the information requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 the exchange act therefore we file periodic reports proxy statements and other information with the securities and exchange commission sec the sec maintains an internet site httpwwwsecgov that contains reports proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically

 

financial and other information about us is available on our web site  httpsinvestorsbiotechnecom  we make available on our web site copies of our annual report on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13 or 15d of the exchange act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such material electronically or otherwise furnishing it to the sec

 item 1a risk factors 

  

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements

 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the companys business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” set forth above any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the companys other sec filings could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition

 

conditions in the global economy the particular markets we serve and the financial markets brought about by material global crises may adversely affect our business and financial statements 

 

covid19 is having and will continue to have an adverse impact on our employees operations supply chains and sales and distribution systems including as a result of impacts associated with protective health measures that we other businesses and governments are taking many employers in our primary locations of business have closed partially or fully and required their employees to work from home or not work at all while many businesses have reopened as the pandemic eased in particular locations a resurgence of covid19 cases in those geographies could continue to cause additional closures these site closures have included our customers which have caused and will continue to cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products during the pandemic we have experienced and will continue to experience significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as the pandemic continues we expect to experience lower than normal sales activities and customer orders in most of our businesses and it remains uncertain what impact these declines will have on future sales and customer orders while there has been some improvement in sales in the summer of 2020 there is no certainty that that improvement will continue or how long the economic recovery will take as the pandemic eases in addition to existing travel restrictions countries may continue to close borders impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel which may impact our ability to support our sites and customers in the future while also significantly limiting the ability of our products from moving through the supply chain as a result given the rapid and evolving nature of the virus covid19 will continue to negatively affect our revenue growth and it is uncertain how materially covid19 will affect our global operations which generally will become more severe over an extended period of time any of these impacts would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and at this point the extent of the impact of covid19 remains uncertain

 

in recent months we have introduced new products or modified existing products to serve the research and healthcare markets as they address the global pandemic through novel diagnostic and therapeutic products the most significant of those new product launches we believe is the novel twostep serology assay that was developed based on and in collaboration with mount sinai hospital system and its commercial entity kantaro biosciences in the first half of calendar year 2020 we allocated significant resources to that development while we believe it is promising the product only recently has been introduced commercially there can be no assurance that it will be widely adopted or used especially if the pandemic eases or a vaccine is commercialized alternatively if demand is great there is no assurance we will be able to maintain the personnel raw materials production facilities or other resources required to meet a significantly greater than anticipated need 

 

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for revenue growth in light of competitive challenges 

 

we face significant competition across many of our product lines competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in china india and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors actions may impact the companys future sales and earnings

 

to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to maintain and improve our revenue growth including

 

        

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business

 

our acquisition growth strategy poses financial management and other risks and challenges 

  

we routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets and have completed sixteen acquisitions and several investments in the last eight years however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons including competition among buyers the high valuations of businesses in our industry the need for regulatory and other approvals and availability of capital there can be no assurance that we will engage in any additional acquisitions or that we will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits in addition acquisitions financed with borrowings could make us more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect our earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense

 

 

our inability to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  

 

our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company when we do identify and consummate acquisitions we may face financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention integration of different corporate cultures increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities indemnities potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our overall business

 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired 

 

we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment and declines in the financial condition of our business we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired any such charge would adversely impact our financial results

 

in addition the companys expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected for example the company has an approximate 2 equity investment in publicly traded chemocentryx inc nasdaq ccxi that is valued at 878 million as of june 30 2020 the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares in fiscal 2017 we also invested and held a minority interest in privatelyheld astute medical inc astute a diagnostics company developing new diagnostics tests relating to kidney injury in fiscal 2018 astute was acquired by a third party and we realized a 162 million loss on our investment

 

significant developments or uncertainties stemming from the us administration or resulting in potential changes resulting from the elections in the us this fall including changes in us trade policies tariffs healthcare taxes or other matters and the reaction of other countries thereto could have an adverse effect on our business 

 

changes potential changes or uncertainties in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate or governing the health care system can adversely affect our business and financial statements for example the current us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and has over the last three years imposed significant increases on tariffs for goods imported into the united states particularly from china other countries have responded similarly with tariffs on goods entering their countries the us administration has also indicated an intention to ask congress to make significant changes replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act and government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs

 

additionally in a referendum vote held on june 23 2016 the united kingdom uk voted to leave the european union eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the uk and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years as the parties negotiate new trade agreements and governmental relationships  our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the uks exit from the eu in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the uk and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the uk any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial results particularly since our european headquarters and shipping facilities are currently located in the uk additionally attracting and retaining qualified employees who are citizens of eu countries to our uk facilities may be more difficult given the uncertainties resulting from the uks withdrawal

 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses  

 

we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 

 

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the us and elsewhere and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies  

 

we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the us federal drug administration the fda the us drug enforcement agency the dea the us department of health and human services the dhhs and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale the manufacture distribution and marketing of many of our products and services including medical devices and pharma services are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea and other equivalent local state federal and nonus regulatory authorities in addition we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities including without limitation remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs any or all of which could be significant we are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers ability to provide products to their customers

 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

 

we are subject to financial operating legal and compliance risk associated with global operations 

 

we engage in business globally with approximately 45 of our sales revenue in fiscal 2020 coming from outside the us in addition one of our strategies is to expand geographically particularly in china india and in developing countries both through distribution and through direct operations this subjects us to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions currency fluctuations tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond our control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases

 

the application of laws and regulations impacting global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibited business conduct and damage to our reputation we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us

 

we continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with our internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by our internal policies could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties

 

 

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

 

our protein sciences segment products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions in addition to the impacts described above relating to covid19 research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies our genomics and diagnostics segment products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market which relies largely on government healthcarerelated policies and funding changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and correspondingly our sales to them several years ago the us and global economies experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover in some parts of the world such downturns and other reductions or delays in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products we carry essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

 

management could fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting which could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as we continue to grow and acquire additional business we may fail to implement effective internal controls for our recently acquired operations that may result in a material weakness additionally we may experience a breakdown in internal controls over our existing businesses that would prevent the timely identification of a material misstatement in our interim or annual financial statements a material weakness may also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares

 

our success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel and creating a new culture that includes the employees joining through acquisition 

 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production sales and marketing and management personnel are critical to our success our anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel we also operate in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong making employee retention particularly challenging for example some of our fastest growing businesses are located in northern california and eastern massachusetts both of which generally have low unemployment and a competitive environment for finding and retaining talent our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees as we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business

 

cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our computer hardware software and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to our reputation data integrity andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits under data privacy or other laws or contractual requirements 

  

the integrity and protection of our own data and that of our customers and employees is critical to our business the regulatory environment governing information security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products and services to customers although our computer and communications hardware are protected through physical and software safeguards they are still vulnerable to fire storm flood power loss earthquakes telecommunications failures physical or software breakins software viruses and similar events these events could lead to the unauthorized access disclosure and use of nonpublic information the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world as a result we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures if our computer systems are compromised we could be subject to fines damages litigation and enforcement actions customers could curtail or cease using its applications and we could lose trade secrets the occurrence of which could harm our business

 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy most notably last year the state of california passed sweeping privacy legislation called the california consumer privacy act or ccpa that has impacted our business and could result in more material impacts as implementing regulations are issued european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe and the recentlyenacted eu general data protection regulation which took effect in may 2018 imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data several countries such as china and russia have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements

 

 

we are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain our intellectual property including trade secrets if we fail to protect our intellectual property third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us we may lose our technological or competitive advantage or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property we attempt to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements but those agreements can be breached and if they are there may not be an adequate remedy if trade secrets become publicly known we could lose our competitive position

 

we also attempt to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process as of june 30 2020 we owned or exclusively licensed over 515 granted patents and pending patent applications we cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted it is possible that if patents are granted to us others will design around our patented technologies further other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable we may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications any successful thirdparty challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection or is found to be invalid or unenforceable we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors products our competitive position could be adversely affected as could our business both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive

 

we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope coverage and validity of others proprietary rights or to defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement any of which could be timeintensive and costly and may adversely impact our business 

 

our success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate we have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties

 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert managements focus from other business concerns if we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others we could be required to cease certain activities alter our products or processes or pay licensing fees this could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent we may be unable to sell some of our products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if we do not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect our earnings

  

our exodx prostateintelliscore or epi test may not receive or maintain government or private reimbursement coverage for clinical laboratory testing as planned which may have a material adverse effect upon the revenue and profits for this product line 

 

in august 2018 we acquired exosome diagnostics which sells the exodx prostate or epi test a noninvasive urine test that predicts the aggressiveness of prostate cancer we received public payer coverage for certain uses but are currently seeking expanded coverage from public payors as well as coverage decisions regarding reimbursement from additional private payers however the process and timeline for obtaining coverage decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict moreover federal and state government payers such as medicare and medicaid as well as insurers including managed care organizations continue to increase their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services from time to time congress considers and implements changes in medicare fee schedules affecting reimbursement rates in conjunction with budgetary legislation further reimbursement reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment such as prior authorization diagnosis code and other claims edits or a physician or qualified practitioner’s signature on test requisitions may be implemented from time to time still further changes in thirdparty payer regulations policies or laboratory benefit or utilization management programs as well as actions by federal and state agencies regulating insurance including healthcare exchanges or changes in other laws regulations or policies may have a material adverse effect on revenue and earnings associated with exosome diagnostics’ exodx prostate test

 

the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties andor exclusion from government programs if its exosome diagnostics’ epi business violates federal state local or international laws including but not limited to antifraud and abuse laws 

 

as a healthcare provider the company’s exosome diagnostics’ exodx prostate business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal state and local levels in the us and other countries where it operates the company’s failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians hospitals and health systems could lead to civil and criminal penalties exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possibly prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position such occurrences regardless of their outcome could damage the company’s reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties 

 

 

the company’s exosome diagnostics exodx prostate business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under or future changes in or interpretations of the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967 and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia or those of medicare medicaid or government agencies where the company operates its laboratory 

 

the commercial laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive us regulation and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the us by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s clia certificate which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines andor criminal penalties in addition the company’s exodx prostate business is subject to regulation under state law state laws may require that laboratories andor laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the companys exodx prosate business potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s epi business in addition compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly

 

failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines penalties and damage to the company’s reputation and have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business a risk that has been elevated with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics whose laboratory testing service is a healthcare provider that obtains and uses protected health information 

  

if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information it could be subject to monetary fines civil penalties or criminal sanctions in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa privacy and security regulations including the expanded requirements under us health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information phi by covered entities in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and security of phi hipaa restricts the company’s ability to use or disclose phi without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations if the laboratory operations for the company’s business use or disclose phi improperly under these privacy regulations they may incur significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties

  

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products which if disrupted could materially impair our business operations 

 

the companys internal quality control packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the companys sales since certain company products must comply with food and drug administration quality system regulations and because in all instances the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the companys future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions

 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites 

 

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

 

 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” signed by the president of the united states on december 22 2017 which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the states tax response to the tax act t he company anticipates changes in interpretations assumptions and guidance regarding the tax act to be issued by the us treasury department which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods

 

in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as fedex in the us and dhl in europe if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

 

international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in fiscal 2020 currency translation had an unfavorable effect of 52 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services

 

 

we have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy 

 

in connection with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics on august 1 2018 we used a new credit facility governed by a credit agreement entered into on july 28 2018 the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of 600 million which can be increased by an additional 200 million subject to certain conditions and a term loan of 250 million borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of august 21 2020 the company had drawn 337 million under the credit agreement

 

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as

 

   

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions

  

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends

 

our share price will fluctuate 

  

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by

 

   

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

  

for over 10 years our board has consistently declared quarterly dividends of 025 to 032 cents per share in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

overall results 

  

operational update 

 

for fiscal 2020 consolidated net sales increased 4 as compared to fiscal 2019 organic growth was 4 with currency translation and acquisitions having an immaterial impact on revenue the company experienced broadbased organic revenue growth in most major geographic regions and endmarkets prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic this broadbased organic growth was partially offset by the negative impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic experienced by the company in the latter half of fiscal year 2020 as further described in the covid19 business update section 

 

for fiscal 2020 consolidated earnings increased 139 compared to fiscal 2019 the increase in earnings was primarily due to a gain of approximately 137 million on our chemocentryx investment and a gain of approximately 7 million on the settlement of the escrow balance associated with the exosome acquisition after adjusting for acquisition related costs stockbased compensation and certain income tax items in both years adjusted net earnings increased 2 in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings growth was driven by volume leverage which was partially offset by business impacts associated with the covid19 pandemic

covid19 negatively impacted fiscal year 2020 sales growth due to the numerous customer site shutdowns in our academia and biopharma endmarkets that occurred at the end of our third fiscal quarter and continued through our fourth quarter customer site shutdowns will continue to have a negative impact on sales while they remain in effect but we did experience an increase in the number of customer sites that were open at the end of the fourth quarter however we are unable to forecast the impact of customer site closures given the uncertainty that some customer sites may close again due to increases in covid19 cases occurring in their region and over the duration of the covid19 pandemic once the pandemic has eased we anticipate a positive longterm outlook for sales growth resulting from expected future funding increases within lifescience research in response to the current pandemic

 

the company has responded to the pandemic by leveraging our deep product portfolio and scientific expertise to develop robust covid19 product and service offerings providing critical support for both clinical care and therapeutic development the companys ongoing efforts to utilize our portfolio of products and services to enable solutions for this evolving pandemic may partially offset the impact of our customer site closures

 

adjusted eps was negatively impacted by covid19 primarily due to the sales impacts described above we anticipate the short and longterm impacts of covid19 on adjusted eps to be similar to that of sales growth

 

the company remains in a strong financial position with sufficient available cash as well as access to additional funding if necessary through our longterm debt agreement we did not experience any material changes to our june 30 2020 balance sheet resulting from covid19 for items such as additional reserves or asset impairments resulting from the pandemic

 

the company remains fully operational as we abide by local covid19 safety regulations across the world to achieve this the company has certain employees working remotely and has adopted significant protective measures for our employees on site including staggered shifts social distancing and hygiene best practices recommended by the centers for disease control cdc and local public health officials in addition the company has taken additional steps to monitor and strengthen our supply chain to maintain an uninterrupted supply of our critical products and services

 

 

 

results of operations

consolidated net sales growth was as follows

 

  

consolidated net sales by segment were as follows in thousands 

 

  

in fiscal 2020 protein sciences segment net sales increased 2 compared to fiscal 2019 organic growth for the segment was 3 for the fiscal year with foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 1 and acquisitions contributing an immaterial amount 

 

overall segment growth was driven by strong biopharma sales in north america and strong overall performance in china which was partially offset by the disruption in research markets due to numerous customer site closures relating to the covid19 pandemic that occurred in the second half of fiscal 2020 

in fiscal 2020 diagnostics and genomics segment net sales increased 8 compared to fiscal 2019 organic growth was 8 with acquisitions and foreign currency having an immaterial impact on revenue

 

overall segment revenue growth was driven by strong performance in our exodx prostate test rna scope  hematology and assay development products lines prior to the onset of the covid19 pandemic the closure of academic site labs and limitation of nonessential medical procedures resulting from the covid19 pandemic significantly impacted sales of our rna scope product line and our exodx prostate test respectively in the latter portion of the fiscal year these negative sales impacts were partially offset through growth in supplying specialty diagnostic antibodies and other raw materials to covid19 testing manufacturers

 

in fiscal 2019 protein sciences segment net sales increased 13 compared to fiscal 2018 organic growth for the segment was 13 for the fiscal year with acquisitions contributing 2 and foreign currency translation having an unfavorable impact of 2 growth was broadbased and especially strong in the antibodies and cell therapy consumables as well as the simple western and simple plex instrument product categories

gross margins 

  

consolidated gross margins were 654 663 and 672 in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory in fiscal 2019 and 2018 and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 under purchase accounting inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold amortization of intangibles and stock compensation expense adjusted gross margins were 703 715 and 715 in fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively fiscal 2020 adjusted gross margin was negatively impacted by product mix when compared to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018

 

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales is as follows

 

  

fluctuations in adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net sales have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix we expect that in the future gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions

 

management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company’s two segments segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were as follows 

 

  

the small decrease in the protein sciences segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 and 2018 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales within the segment 

 

the increase in diagnostics and genomics in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was primarily due to volume leverage operational productivity and revenue growth against a similar cost base in recent acquisitions the decrease in the diagnostics and genomics gross margin percentages for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 were due to negative gross margins for acquisitions made in the segment namely exosomedx

 

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 38 million 1 in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in corporate expenses and a gain resulting from a settlement of amounts held in escrow from the exosomedx acquisition between the company and the former shareholders these reductions to our selling general and administrative expenses were partially offset by an increase in expense within the segments 

 

selling general and administrative expense increased 237 million 10 in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was primarily driven by an additional cost base from our fiscal 2019 acquisitions additional stockbased compensation expense and additional amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded from our fiscal 2019 acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a reduction in acquisition related expenses 

 

 

consolidated selling general and administrative expenses were composed of the following in thousands

research and development expenses increased 28 million 4 and 71 million 13 in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively as compared to prior year periods the increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to continued investment in future growth platforms of the company recent acquisitions and the development of new covid19 products the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to our exosomedx acquisition 

 

  

 

net interest income  expense 

  

net interest incomeexpense for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 was 186 million 211 million and 98 million respectively net interest expense in fiscal 2020 decreased when compared to fiscal 2019 due to a reduction in our average longterm debt net interest expense increased in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 due to an increase in our average longterm debt resulting from the debt agreement the company entered into in conjunction with our exosomedx acquisition

income taxes 

  

income taxes for fiscal 2020 2019 and 2018 were at effective rates of 171 142 and 02 respectively of consolidated earnings before income taxes the change in the effective tax rate was driven by discrete tax items the companys discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2020 primarily related to sharebased compensation excess tax benefits of 177 million the companys discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2019 primarily related to sharebased compensation excess tax benefits of 72 million 32 million related to deductible acquisition payments made to employees and third parties and 20 million for tax refunds relating to certain state apportionments in fiscal 2018 the company recognized net discrete tax benefits of 344 million the primary driver in fiscal 2018 discrete tax benefits was a discrete net tax benefit of 330 million related to the tax act as described in note 11 also impacting the company’s fiscal 2018 effective tax rate was a 22 million tax benefit related to sharebased compensation excess tax benefits offset by a net discrete tax expense of 42 million related to the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not a tax deductible expense

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and nongaap tax rate applied to the identified nongaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and june 30 2019 is primarily a result of discrete tax items refer to note 11 for additional discussion relating to the change in discrete tax items between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019

 

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and nongaap tax rate applied to the identified nongaap adjustments for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 is due primarily to recording the items attributable to the new tax legislation in the us which resulted in a 330 million tax benefit offsetting this benefit is the impact of the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not tax deductible for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 the company recorded acquisition related expense of 201 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration

critical accounting policies 

  

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

  

business combinations 

  

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition the calculations used to determine the fair value of the longlived assets acquired primarily intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgment we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including but not limited to the nature of the acquired company’s business its competitive position strengths and challenges its historical financial position and performance estimated customer retention rates discount rates and future plans for the combined entity we may also engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired longlived assets

 

the fair value of acquired technology is generally the primary asset identified and therefore estimated using the multiperiod excess earnings method the multiperiod excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets such as trade names that contributed to the generation of the cash flows the resulting cash flow which is attributable solely to the primary asset acquired is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value the trade name is generally calculated using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings in circumstances that customer relationship assets are identified that are not the primary asset they are valued using the distributor model income approach which isolates revenues and cash flow associated with the sales and distribution function of the entity and attributable to customerrelated assets which are then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value 

 

 

we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made for potential payments related to financial performance based milestones projected revenue andor ebitda amounts volatility and discount rates assumptions are included in the estimated amounts for potential payments related to product development milestones the fair value is based on the probability of achievement of such milestones the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis

 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets which determines the amount of acquisitionrelated amortization expense we will record in future periods each reporting period we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization

 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings

 

the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income for example different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ consequently to the extent a longerlived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorterlived asset net income in a given period may be higher additionally assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill as goodwill is not amortized this would benefit net income in a given period although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis

  

impairment of goodwill 

  

goodwill 

  

goodwill was 7283 million as of june 30 2020 which represented 359 of total assets goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment

 

to analyze goodwill for impairment we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments which considers among other things the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business

 

there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1 2002

  

 

2020 goodwill impairment analyses 

 

in completing our 2020 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 201704 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

 

because our 2020 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units the summation of our reporting units fair values as indicated by our discounted cash flow calculations were compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

 

the quantitative assessment completed as of april 1 2020 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom accordingly the company determined there was no indication of impairment of goodwill in our annual goodwill impairment analysis further no triggering events were identified in the year ended june 30 2020 that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment beyond our required annual goodwill impairment assessment

 

2019 goodwill impairment analyses 

 

at the beginning of the quarter ended march 31 2019 the company realigned the management of certain business processes between reporting units within the same segment a goodwill allocation was performed between the impacted reporting units based on the relative fair value of the processes realigned in conjunction with the realignment a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed both prior to and subsequent to the realignment the quantitative impairment assessments performed utilized a consistent process with our fiscal 2020 quantitative goodwill impairment assessment described above the quantitative assessment indicated that all of the impacted reporting units had substantial headroom both prior to and subsequent to the realignment this impairment assessment performed was sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

 

in conducting our annual goodwill impairment test as of april 1 2019 we elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether changes in events or circumstances since our most recent quantitative test for goodwill impairment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on its annual analysis the company determined there was no indication of impairment of goodwill 

 

2018 goodwill impairment analyses 

 

in completing our 2018 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units the quantitative impairment assessments performed utilized a consistent process with our fiscal 2020 quantitative goodwill impairment assessment described above the quantitative assessment completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom this impairment assessment performed was sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

nongaap financial measures 

  

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap these nongaap measures include

 

  

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results we use these nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions including with respect to incentive compensation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for periodtoperiod comparison of results

 

our nongaap financial measure of organic growth represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceeding 12 months as well as the impact of foreign currency excluding these measures provides more useful periodtoperiod comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which can vary significantly from period to period and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period

 

our nongaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory amortization of acquisition intangibles acquisition related expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value of contingent consideration and other nonrecurring items including nonrecurring costs and gains the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets purchase accounting adjustments including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisitionrelated expenses inclusive of the changes in fair value contingent consideration and other nonrecurring items including gains or losses on legal settlements and onetime assessments from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events and are not reflective of our internal investments the costs of developing producing supporting and selling our products and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure additionally these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity

 

the company’s nongaap adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis also excludes stockbased compensation expense which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards restructuring impairments of equity method investments gain and losses from investments and certain adjustments to income tax expense stockbased compensation is excluded from nongaap adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge specifically the varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions variety of award types and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations impairments of equity investments are excluded as they are not part of our daytoday operating decisions additionally gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded costs related to restructuring activities including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs the company independently calculates a nongaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified nongaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments in addition the tax impact of other discrete and nonrecurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings we believe these tax items can significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs andor income associated with historical trends and future results

 

the company periodically reassesses the components of our nongaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance changes in how we make financial and operational decisions and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful

 

readers are encouraged to review the reconciliations of the adjusted financial measures used in managements discussion and analysis of the financial condition of the company to their most directly comparable gaap financial measures provided within the companys consolidated financial statements

 

 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures 

about market risk 

 

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 44  of the companys consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020 were made in foreign currencies including 20 in euro 6 in british pound sterling 9 in chinese yuan and the remaining 9 in other currencies the company is exposed to market risk primarily from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling chinese yuan and canadian dollar as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the companys foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation

 

monthend exchange rates between the euro british pound sterling chinese yuan canadian dollar and the us dollar which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods were as follows

 

  

the companys exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements but receivable or payable in another currency

 

the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in other nonoperating expense net in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss

protein sciences segment 

 

the protein sciences segment is comprised of divisions with complementary product offerings serving many of the same customers – the reagent solutions division and the analytical solutions division

 

protein sciences segment products 

 

the reagents solutions division consists of specialized proteins such as cytokines and growth factors antibodies small molecules tissue culture sera and cell selection technologies traditionally used by researchers to further their life science experimental activities and by companies developing next generation diagnostics and therapeutics especially companies developing cell and genebased therapeutics key product brands include rd systems tocris biosciences novus biologicals atlanta biologicals and quad technologies most recently we acquired bmogen technologies which has a nonviral transposonbased technology for gene editing a key technology targeted for the cell and gene therapy market our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides high quality tools that customers can use in solving the complex biological pathways and glean knowledge that may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to address different pathologies

 

the analytical solutions division includes manual and automated protein analysis instruments and immunoassays that are used in quantifying proteins in a variety of biological fluids products in this division include traditional manual platebased immunoassays fully automated multiplex immunoassays on various instrument platforms and automated western blotting and isoelectric focusing analysis of complex protein samples key product brands include rd systems and proteinsimple a number of our products have been demonstrated to have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including cancer autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation neurological disorders and kidney failure immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics in fact we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for a few of our immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices 

 

protein sciences segment customers and distribution methods 

our customers for this segment include researchers in academia  government and industry chiefly pharmaceutical and biotech companies as well as diagnosticcompanion diagnostic and therapeutic customers especially customers engaged in the development of cell  gene based therapies our biologics line of products in the analytical solutions division is used primarily by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies we sell our products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china we have a sales and marketing partnership agreement with fisher scientific in order to bolster our market presence in north america and leverage the transactional efficiencies offered by the large fisher organization we also sell through third party distributors in china japan certain eastern european countries and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of the protein sciences segments net sales during fiscal 2019 2018 or 2017

 

 

protein sciences segment competitors 

 

with respect to the reagent solutions division of this segment a number of large companies supply the worldwide market for proteinrelated and chemicallybased research and diagnostic reagents including bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc peprotech inc abcam plc and thermo fisher scientific inc as well as a number of smaller niche competitors market success is primarily dependent upon product innovation and quality selection of products price and reputation we believe we are one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine and growth factors in the research market we further believe that the expansion of our product offering the recognized quality of our products and the ability to continue to bring novel cutting edge products and solutions to the market will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research diagnostic and therapeutics markets our analytical solutions division has a number of similar competitors our simple western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional manual western blotting technique as a result we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional western blot users these competitors include biorad laboratories merck kgaa perkinelmer and thermo fisher scientific all of these vendors provide elements of the traditional work flow similarly our simpleplex platform replaces the traditional manual elisa assay and introduces an automated multiplex immunoassay feature competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for elisas including meso scale discovery perkinelmer thermo fisher luminex millipore molecular devices tecan biotek quanterix and biorad laboratories the primary competitors for our biologics instrumentation are agilent technologies danaher and perkinelmer as well as ge healthcare shimadzu thermo fisher and waters we believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality

 

 

protein sciences segment manufacturing 

  

we are not dependent on key or sole source suppliers for most of our products in the protein sciences segment we develop and manufacture the majority of our proteins using recombinant dna technology thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources our antibodies are produced using a variety of technologies including traditional animal immunization and hybridoma technology as well as recombinant antibody techniques our chemicalbased small molecule products are synthesized from widely available products

 

we manufacture our analytical solutions division instrumentation products for this segment at various locations in the united states and canada we manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables components subassemblies and autosamplers used with or included in our systems which are manufactured to our specifications as with other products sold in this segment we are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers we conduct all final testing and inspection of our products we have established a quality control program including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures all of our protein sciences segment manufacturing sites are iso 9001 or iso 13485 certified or are in the process of being iso certified

 

the majority of our reagent solutions division products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers orders while most of our analytical solutions products are shipped within one to two weeks of receipt of an order

 

there was no significant backlog of orders for our protein sciences segment products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2018

 

diagnostic s and genomics segment 

 

the diagnostics and genomics segment also includes two divisions focused primarily in the diagnostics market – the diagnostics division and the genomics division

 

diagnostics and genomics segment products 

  

the diagnostic division consists of regulated products traditionally used as calibrators and controls in the clinical setting also included are instrument and process control products for hematology blood chemistry blood gases coagulation controls and reagents used in various diagnostic applications often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis tailored to a customers specific diagnostic assay technology we supply these reagents in various formats including liquid frozen or in lyophilized form most of these products are sold on an original equipment manufacturer oem basis to instrument manufacturers with most products being fdacleared products

 

the genomics division includes products aimed at nucleic acid rna or dna analysis that can be used for diagnostic or research applications key product brands include advanced cell diagnostics or acd and exosome diagnostics acd products are aimed at rna analysis of tissue while exosome diagnostics focuses on exosomebased liquid biopsy techniques that analyze genes or their transcripts the first commercialized test from exosome diagnostics is a noninvasive urinebased assay for prostate cancer used as an aid in deciding the need for an initial biopsy

 

 

diagnostics and genomics segment customers and distribution methods 

  

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for our diagnostics division products the majority of diagnostics sales are through oem agreements  but we sell some of our diagnostics products directly to customers and in europe and asia also through distributors the customers for the acd research products include researchers in academia as well as investigators in pharmaceutical and biotech companies we sell our products directly to those customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china and through distributors elsewhere in addition to being useful research tools our rna in situ hybridization assays have diagnostics applications as well and several are currently under review by the fda in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies we offer test services using our noninvasive urinebased assays for prostate cancer detection in the united states through a diagnostic laboratory regulated under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments or clia customers are patients prescribed such tests by their physicians

 

no customers accounted for 10 or more of the reporting segments consolidated net sales during fiscal years 2019 2018 or 2017

  

diagnostics and genomics segment competitors 

 

in the diagnostics division the competitors for our hematology controls product line include danaher beckman coulter and streck for our other control and calibrator products sold in this division the principal competitors are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation we compete based primarily on product performance quality and price in this division seracare hytest ltd and thermo fisher scientific are additional competitors in the clinical diagnostic manufacturing and reagents markets

 

competitors in the genomics division are varied depending on the product line while there are not any direct competitors for the rnabased in situ hybridization products sold under the acd brand they are intended to be an alternative to immunohistochemistry assays and pcrbased diagnostic tests in certain circumstances the noninvasive urinebased assay offered under our exosome diagnostics brand and used for prostate cancer biopsy decisions is supplemental to bloodbased prostatespecific antigen psa tests and is competitive with some other smaller companies that offer liquid biopsybased alternatives such as 4kscore offered by opko health and selectmdx offered by mdxhealth

 

diagnostics and genomics segment manufacturing 

 

the primary raw material for our hematology controls products is whole blood we purchase human blood from commercial blood banks and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business thus far other controls are derived from various bodily fluids or cells from different animal species which are then processed inhouse to isolate the product of interest or from other bulk reagent suppliers that specialize in certain products our other reagent products are manufactured using a variety of suppliers with no supplier representing a material portion of our business

 

most of the hematology controls products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule however the majority of our business in this segment are large orders shipped based on our customers needs we are highly dependent on our customers’ demand and inventory controls consequently our revenues can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year

 

our genomics division products and services are all synthesized from widely available products we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products in this division 

 

there was no significant backlog of orders for our diagnostics and genomics segment as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2018

 

 

geographic information 

 

following is financial information relating to geographic areas in thousands 

 

  

  

 

net sales are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer or distributor longlived assets are comprised of land buildings and improvements and equipment net of accumulated depreciation see the description of risks associated with the companys foreign subsidiaries in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

  

products under development 

 

biotechne is engaged in continuous research and development in all of our major product lines we believe that our future success depends to a large extent on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs

 

in fiscal 2019 biotechne introduce d approximately 1400 new p roducts we also expect to significantly expand our portfolio of products through acquisitions as well as continued product development in our existing businesses however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

 

  

intellectual property 

 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections

 

as of june 30 2019 we had rights t o 211 granted patents and approximately 175 pending patent applications in particular products in the analytical solutions and genomics divisions are protected primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents in addition certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio patent protection if granted generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant we cannot provide assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of o ur competitors products or services

 

in addition to pursuing patents on our products we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets particularly in the reagent solutions division of our protein sciences segment we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees consultants corporate partners and when needed our advisors see the description of risks associated with the companys intellectual property in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k

 

no assurance can be given that biotechnes products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others biotechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights biotechne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive andor nonexclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research andor diagnostics markets

 

biotechne has obtained trademark registration in certain countries for certain of its brand and product names biotechne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered

 

 

seasonality of business 

 

biotechne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base particularly for the protein sciences segment a majority of diagnostics division products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer consequently sales for that segment can be unpredictable and not necessarily based on seasonality as a result we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue from this segment

 

laws and regulations 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production marketing handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration and various comparable state and foreign agencies as biotechne’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury privacy laws in various jurisdictions impact our business in a number of ways including requiring us to take care when processing employee and customer data one of our products under our exosome diagnostics brand is offered as a test under a cliacertified laboratory consequently we must comply with governmental regulations relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians hospitals and health systems while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements

 

 




 item 1a risk factors 

  

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements

 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the companys business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” set forth above any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the companys other sec filings could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for revenue growth in light of competitive challenges 

 

we face significant competition across many of our product lines competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in china india and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors actions may impact the companys future sales and earnings

 

to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to maintain and improve our revenue growth including

 

        

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business

 

our acquisition growth strategy poses financial management and other risks and challenges 

  

we routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets and have completed sixteen acquisitions and several investments in the last seven years however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons including competition among buyers the high valuations of businesses in our industry the need for regulatory and other approvals and availability of capital there can be no assurance that we will engage in any additional acquisitions or that we will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits in addition acquisitions financed with borrowings could make us more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect our earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense

 

  

our inability to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  

 

our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company when we do identify and consummate acquisitions we may face financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention difficulty with integrating acquired businesses integration of different corporate cultures increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities indemnities potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our overall business

 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired 

 

we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment and declines in the financial condition of our business we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired any such charge would adversely impact our financial results

 

in addition the companys expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected for example the company has an approximate 7 equity investment in publicly traded chemocentryx inc nasdaq ccxi that is valued at 382 million as of june 30 2019 the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares in fiscal 2017 we also invested and held a minority interest in privatelyheld astute medical inc astute a diagnostics company developing new diagnostics tests relating to kidney injury in fiscal 2018 astute was acquired by a third party and we realized a 162 million loss on our investment

 

significant developments stemming from the us administration or the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us 

 

the us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements and is imposing significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states particularly from china other countries have responded similarly with tariffs on goods entering their countries the us administration has also indicated an intention to ask congress to make significant changes replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act and government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business

  

additionally in a referendum vote held on june 23 2016 the united kingdom uk voted to leave the european union eu this referendum has created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for years our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom’s referendum in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreements between the united kingdom and other countries including the united states and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barriers in the united kingdom any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial results particularly since our european headquarters and shipping facilities are currently located in the uk additionally attracting and retaining qualified employees who are citizens of eu countries to our uk facilities may be more difficult given the uncertainties resulting from the uk withdrawal

 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses  

 

we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 

 

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the us and elsewhere and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies  

 

we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the us federal drug administration the fda the us drug enforcement agency the dea the us department of health and human services the dhhs and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale the manufacture distribution and marketing of many of our products and services including medical devices and pharma services are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea and other equivalent local state federal and nonus regulatory authorities in addition we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities including without limitation remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs any or all of which could be significant we are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers ability to provide products to their customers

 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

we are subject to financial operating legal and compliance risk associated with global operations 

 

we engage in business globally with approximately 45 of our sales revenue in fiscal 2019 coming from outside the us in addition one of our strategies is to expand geographically particularly in china india and in developing countries both through distribution and through direct operations this subjects us to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions currency fluctuations tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond our control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases

 

the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibited business conduct and damage to our reputation we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us

 

we continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with our internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by our internal policies could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties

 

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

 

our protein sciences segment products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies our diagnostics segment products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market which relies largely on government healthcarerelated policies and funding changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and correspondingly our sales to them several years ago the us and global economies experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover in some parts of the world such downturns and other reductions or delays in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products we carry essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

 

 

several years ago we identified and remediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which if recurring could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act during fiscal 2016 management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of these material weaknesses our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal controlan integrated framework 2013 framework for the years ended june 30 2016 and 2017 in fiscal 2018 we completed a remediation plan that addressed these material weaknesses as we continue to grow and acquire additional business we may fail to implement effective internal controls for our recently acquired operations that result in additional material weaknesses and harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares

 

our success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel and creating a new culture that includes the employees joining through acquisition 

 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production sales and marketing and management personnel are critical to our success our anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel we also operate in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong making employee retention particularly challenging in those locations for example some of our fastest growing businesses are located in northern california and eastern massachusetts both of which currently are experiencing low unemployment and a competitive environment for finding and retaining talent our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees as we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business

 

cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our computer hardware software and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to our reputation data integrity andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits under data privacy or other laws or contractual requirements 

  

the integrity and protection of our own data and that of our customers and employees is critical to our business the regulatory environment governing information security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products and services to customers although our computer and communications hardware are protected through physical and software safeguards they are still vulnerable to fire storm flood power loss earthquakes telecommunications failures physical or software breakins software viruses and similar events these events could lead to the unauthorized access disclosure and use of nonpublic information the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world as a result we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures if our computer systems are compromised we could be subject to fines damages litigation and enforcement actions customers could curtail or cease using its applications and we could lose trade secrets the occurrence of which could harm our business

 

if we are unable to maintain reliable information technology systems and appropriate controls with respect to global data privacy and security requirements and prevent data breaches we may suffer regulatory consequences in addition to business consequences as a global organization we are subject to data privacy and security laws regulations and customerimposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential personal andor sensitive data in the course of our business for example in the united states individual states regulate data breach and security requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy european laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of europe and the recentlyenacted eu general data protection regulation which took effect in may 2018 imposes significantly stricter requirements in how we collect and process personal data several countries such as china and russia have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and data breaches or violations of data privacy laws can result in fines reputational damage and civil lawsuits any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statements

 

 

we are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain our intellectual property including trade secrets if we fail to protect our intellectual property third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us we may lose our technological or competitive advantage or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property we attempt to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements but those agreements can be breached and if they are there may not be an adequate remedy if trade secrets become publicly known we could lose our competitive position

 

we also attempt to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process as of june 30 2019 we owned or exclusively licensed o ver 400 granted paten ts and pending patent applications we cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted it is possible that if patents are granted to us others will design around our patented technologies further other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable we may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications any successful thirdparty challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection or is found to be invalid or unenforceable we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors products our competitive position could be adversely affected as could our business both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive

 

we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope coverage and validity of others proprietary rights or to defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement any of which could be timeintensive and costly and may adversely impact our business 

 

our success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate we have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties

 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert managements focus from other business concerns if we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others we could be required to cease certain activities alter our products or processes or pay licensing fees this could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent we may be unable to sell some of our products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if we do not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect our earnings

  

our exodx prostateintelliscore or epi test may not receive or maintain government or private reimbursement coverage for clinical laboratory testing as planned which may have a material adverse effect upon the revenue and profits for this product line 

 

in august 2018 we acquired exosome diagnostics which sells the epi test a noninvasive urine test that predicts the aggressiveness of prostate cancer we are currently seeking coverage decisions regarding reimbursement from both public and private payers however the process and timeline for obtaining coverage decisions is uncertain and difficult to predict moreover federal and state government payers such as medicare and medicaid as well as insurers including managed care organizations continue to increase their efforts to control the cost utilization and delivery of healthcare services from time to time congress considers and implements changes in medicare fee schedules affecting reimbursement rates in conjunction with budgetary legislation further reimbursement reductions due to changes in policy regarding coverage of tests or other requirements for payment such as prior authorization diagnosis code and other claims edits or a physician or qualified practitioner’s signature on test requisitions may be implemented from time to time still further changes in thirdparty payer regulations policies or laboratory benefit or utilization management programs as well as actions by federal and state agencies regulating insurance including healthcare exchanges or changes in other laws regulations or policies may have a material adverse effect on revenue and earnings associated with exosome diagnostics’ epi product

 

the company could face significant monetary damages and penalties andor exclusion from government programs if its exosome diagnostics’ epi business violates federal state local or international laws including but not limited to antifraud and abuse laws 

 

as a healthcare provider the company’s exosome diagnostics’ epi business is subject to extensive regulation at the federal state and local levels in the us and other countries where it operates the company’s failure to meet governmental requirements under these regulations including those relating to billing practices and financial relationships with physicians hospitals and health systems could lead to civil and criminal penalties exclusion from participation in medicare and medicaid and possibly prohibitions or restrictions on the use of its laboratories while the company believes that it is in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements there is a risk that government authorities might take a contrary position such occurrences regardless of their outcome could damage the company’s reputation and adversely affect important business relationships it has with third parties 

 

 

  the company’s exosome diagnostics epi business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under or future changes in or interpretations of the law or regulations of the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1967 and the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988 clia or those of medicare medicaid or government agencies where the company operates its laboratory 

 

the commercial laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive us regulation and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts clia extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the us by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency the sanction for failure to comply with clia requirements may be suspension revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s clia certificate which is necessary to conduct business as well as significant fines andor criminal penalties in addition the company’s epi business is subject to regulation under state law state laws may require that laboratories andor laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records applicable statutes and regulations could be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the companys epi business potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses certificates and authorizations which could have a material adverse effect on the company’s epi business in addition compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on the company which may be costly

 

failure to comply with privacy and security laws and regulations could result in fines penalties and damage to the company’s reputation and have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business a risk that has been elevated with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics whose laboratory testing service is a healthcare provider that obtains and uses protected health information 

  

if the company does not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to protecting the privacy and security of personal or health information it could be subject to monetary fines civil penalties or criminal sanctions in the us the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa privacy and security regulations including the expanded requirements under us health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information phi by covered entities in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality integrity and security of phi hipaa restricts the company’s ability to use or disclose phi without patient authorization for purposes other than payment treatment or healthcare operations as defined by hipaa except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and other permitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations if the laboratory operations for the company’s epi business use or disclose phi improperly under these privacy regulations they may incur significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of phi in violation of the privacy and security regulations including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties

  

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products which if disrupted could materially impair our business operations 

 

the companys internal quality control packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the companys sales since certain company products must comply with food and drug administration quality system regulations and because in all instances the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason particularly at the minneapolis facility could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the companys future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions

 

 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites 

 

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” signed by the president of the united states on december 22 2017 which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the state tax response to the tax act reasonable estimates were used in determining several of the components of the impact of the tax act including our fiscal 2018 deferred income tax activity and the amount of post1986 foreign deferred earnings subject to the repatriation toll charge in addition certain provisions of the tax act including the base erosion antiabuse tax beat and the provision designed to tax currently global intangible lowtax income gilti were effective for the company in the year beginning july 1 2018 in addition the company anticipates changes in interpretations assumptions and guidance regarding the tax act to be issued by the us treasury department which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods

 

in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as fedex in the us and dhl in europe if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

 

international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in fiscal 2019 currency translation had an unfavorable effect of 92 million on revenues due to the strengthening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services

 

  

we have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy 

 

in connection with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics on august 1 2018 we used a new credit facility governed by a credit agreement entered into on july 28 2018 the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of 600 million which can be increased by an additional 200 million subject to certain conditions and a term loan of 250 million borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of august 22 2019 the company had drawn 330 million under the credit agreement

 

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as

 

   

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions

  

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends

 

our share price will fluctuate 

  

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by

 

   

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

  

for the past 10 years our board has consistently declared quarterly dividends of 025 to 032 cents per share in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

gross margins 

  

consolidated gross margins were 663 672 and 665 in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2019 2018 2017 and prior years under purchase accounting inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles adjusted gross margins were 715 715 and 712 in fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively

 

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales is as follows

 

  

 

fluctuations in adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net sales have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix we expect that in the future gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions

 

management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company’s two segments since these results are used for this purpose they are also considered to be prepared in accordance with gaap segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were as follows 

 

  

 

the small decrease in the protein sciences segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales made in this segment the decrease in the diagnostics and genomics gross margin percentages for fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 were due to negative gross margins for acquisitions made in the segment namely exosomedx

 

the protein sciences segment decrease for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales made in this segment the diagnostics and genomics segment gross margin percentages for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 were positively impacted by higher volume leverage and operational productivity

 

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 237 million 10 and 402 million 20 in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively

 

the increase in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by an additional cost base from our fiscal 2019 acquisitions additional stockbased compensation expense and additional amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded from our fiscal 2019 acquisitions these increases were partially offset by a reduction in acquisition related expenses 

 

the increase in fiscal 2018 was driven by additional investments in global commercial resources and administrative infrastructure a larger cost base due to acquisitions and 136 million of additional stockbased compensation expense of which 83 million is from a new retirement policy that permits retirees to continue vesting in certain timebased stock options granted during employment resulting in accelerated stock compensation expense for those employees meeting the definition of retirement eligible

research and development expenses increased 71 million 13 and 18 million 3 in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively as compared to prior year periods the increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2019 as compared to fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to our exosomedx acquisition the increase in research and development from 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to additional expenses from our 2017 acquisition advanced cell diagnostics

 

  

 

net interest income  expense 

  

net interest incomeexpense for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 was 211 million 98 million and 71 million respectively net interest expense in fiscal 2019 increased due to a change in our average longterm debt outstanding for fiscal 2019 net interest expense in fiscal 2018 increased due to changes in interest rates

income taxes 

  

income taxes for fiscal 2019 2018 and 2017 were at effective rates of 142 02 and 320 respectively of consolidated earnings before income taxes  the change in the effective tax rate was driven by discrete tax items the companys discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2019 primarily related to sharebased compensation excess tax benefits of 72 million 32 million related to deductible acquisition payments made to employees and third parties and 20 million for tax refunds relating to certain state apportionments in fiscal 2018 the company recognized net discrete tax benefits of 344 million the primary driver in fiscal 2018 discrete tax benefits was a discrete net tax benefit of 330 million related to the tax act as described in note 11 also impacting the company’s fiscal 2018 effective tax rate was a 22 million tax benefit related to sharebased compensation excess tax benefits offset by a net discrete tax expense of 42 million related to the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not a tax deductible expense

 

the companys effective income tax rate was 02 in fiscal 2018 compared to 320 in fiscal 2017 the decrease in the company’s tax rate for fiscal 2018 was due to the impact of discrete items which were 336 million in fiscal 2018 compared to 39 million in fiscal 2018 the primary driver of discrete items was the net tax benefit of 330 million related to the tax act discussed above recorded in fiscal 2018 

 

 

net earnings

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and nongaap tax rate applied to the identified nongaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019 is primarily a result of discrete tax items refer to note 11 for additional discussion relating to the change in discrete tax items between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 

 

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and nongaap tax rate applied to the identified nongaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018 is due primarily to recording the items attributable to the new tax legislation in the us which resulted in a 330 million tax benefit offsetting this benefit is the impact of the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not tax deductible for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 the company recorded acquisition related expense of 201 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration

critical accounting policies 

  

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

  

business combinations 

  

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition the calculations used to determine the fair value of the longlived assets acquired primarily intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgment we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including but not limited to the nature of the acquired company’s business its competitive position strengths and challenges its historical financial position and performance estimated customer retention rates discount rates and future plans for the combined entity we may also engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired longlived assets

 

the fair value of acquired technology is generally the primary asset identified and therefore estimated using the multiperiod excess earnings method the multiperiod excess earnings method model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the primary asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets such as trade names that contributed to the generation of the cash flows the resulting cash flow which is attributable solely to the primary asset acquired is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value the trade name is generally calculated using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings in circumstances that customer relationship assets are identified that are not the primary asset they are valued using the distributor model income approach which isolates revenues and cash flow associated with the sales and distribution function of the entity and attributable to customerrelated assets which are then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value 

 

 

we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made for potential payments related to financial performance based milestones projected revenue andor ebitda amounts volatility and discount rates assumptions are included in the estimated amounts for potential payments related to product development milestones the fair value is based on the probability of achievement of such milestones the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis

 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets which determines the amount of acquisitionrelated amortization expense we will record in future periods each reporting period we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization

 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings

 

the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income for example different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ consequently to the extent a longerlived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorterlived asset net income in a given period may be higher additionally assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill as goodwill is not amortized this would benefit net income in a given period although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis

  

impairment of goodwill 

  

goodwill 

  

goodwill was 732 million as of june 30 2019 which represented 389 of total assets goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment

 

to analyze goodwill for impairment we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments which considers among other things the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business

  

 

2019 goodwill impairment analyses 

 

at the beginning of the quarter ended march 31 2019 the company realigned the management of certain business processes between reporting units within the same reportable segment a goodwill allocation was performed between the impacted reporting units based on the relative fair value of the processes realigned in conjunction with the realignment a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment was performed both prior to and subsequent to the realignment the quantitative assessment indicated that all of the impacted reporting units had substantial headroom both prior to and subsequent to the realignment

 

because our quantitative analysis performed as of january 1 2019 included all of our reporting units except for our recent acquisition exosome which is a separate reporting unit that was not impacted by the business process realignment the summation of the calculated reporting units’ fair values combined with the fair value of the exosome acquisition was compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations

 

the quantitative assessments completed as of january 1 2019 indicated that all tested reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom changes in the reporting unit’s results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

 

the company has elected april 1 as our annual goodwill impairment date for the exosome reporting unit the company has historically completed our goodwill impairment assessment of our legacy reporting units as of june 30 to better align with our annual internal planning and operating cycle and the underlying changes in our organizational model and business we changed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of april 1 given the substantial headroom in our legacy reporting units and the time period the assessment was performed relative to the most recent quantitative analysis management does not consider the change in our annual impairment assessment to be material to the consolidated financial statements or to constitute a material change in the application of our goodwill accounting principle

 

in conducting our annual goodwill impairment test we elected to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether changes in events or circumstances since our most recent quantitative test for goodwill impairment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount

 

based on its annual analysis the company determined there was no indication of impairment of goodwill further no triggering events or items beyond the realignment discussed above were identified in the year ended june 30 2019 that would require an additional goodwill impairment assessment beyond our required annual goodwill impairment assessment

 

2018 and 2017 goodwill impairment analyses 

 

in completing our 2018 and 2017 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 201704 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

 

because our 2018 and 2017 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units the summation of our reporting units fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations

 

the quantitative assessment completed as of june 30 2018 and 2017 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

    

there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1 2002

nongaap financial measures 

  

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap these nongaap measures include

 

  

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results we use these nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions including with respect to incentive compensation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for periodtoperiod comparison of results

 

our nongaap financial measure of organic growth represents revenue growth excluding revenue from acquisitions within the preceeding 12 months as well as the impact of foreign currency excluding these measures provides more useful periodtoperiod comparison of revenue results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange rates which can vary significantly from period to period and revenue from acquisitions that would not be included in the comparable prior period

 

our nongaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory amortization of acquisition intangibles and acquisition related expenses the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisitionrelated expenses from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events and are not reflective of our internal investments the costs of developing producing supporting and selling our products and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure additionally these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity

 

the company’s nongaap adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis also excludes stockbased compensation expense which is inclusive of the employer portion of payroll taxes on those stock awards restructuring impairments of equity method investments gain and losses from investments and certain adjustments to income tax expense stockbased compensation is excluded from nongaap adjusted net earnings because of the nature of this charge specifically the varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions variety of award types and unpredictability of amount and timing of employer related tax obligations impairments of equity investments are excluded as they are not part of our daytoday operating decisions additionally gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded costs related to restructuring activities including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs the company independently calculates a nongaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified nongaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments in addition the tax impact of other discrete and nonrecurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings we believe these tax items can significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs andor income associated with historical trends and future results

 

the company periodically reassesses the components of our nongaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance changes in how we make financial and operational decisions and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful

 item 1 business 

  

overview 

 

biotechne and its subsidiaries collectively doing business as biotechne corporation biotechne we our us or the company develop manufacture and sell biotechnology reagents instruments and services for the research and clinical diagnostic markets worldwide with our deep product portfolio and application expertise we strive to provide the life sciences community with innovative highquality scientific tools to better understand biological processes and drive discovery of diagnostic and therapeutic products

 

during our fiscal year 2018 we operated with three reporting segments – our biotechnology protein platforms and diagnostics divisions our biotechnology division is a leader in providing high quality consumables and services used for conducting laboratory experiments by both industry and academic scientists within the biotechnology and biomedical life sciences fields all under the primary brands of rd systems novus biologicals tocris bioscience atlanta biologicals trevigen and advanced cell diagnostics our protein platforms division focuses on developing and supplying instrumentation and related consumables designed to simplify protein analysis processes along with single cell protein analysis all under the proteinsimple brand through our diagnostics division we serve the clinical markets with regulated products such as controls calibrators reagents and immunoassays intended for diagnostic uses 

 

we are a minnesota corporation with our global headquarters in minneapolis minnesota we originally were founded over forty years ago in 1976 as research and diagnostic systems inc we became a publicly traded company in 1985 through a merger with techne corporation now biotechne corporation our common stock is listed on the nasdaq under the symbol “tech” we operate globally with offices in multiple locations in the united states europe and asia today our product line extends to over 300000 manufactured products in state of the art facilities to accommodate many of our manufacturing needs

 

our historical focus was on providing high quality proteins antibodies and immunoassays to the life science research market and hematology controls to the diagnostics market beginning in 2012 and accelerating over the last three years we implemented a strategy to accelerate growth in part by acquiring businesses and product portfolios that leveraged and diversified our existing product lines filled portfolio gaps with differentiated high growth businesses and expanded our geographic scope from 2012 through august 27 2018 we have acquired 15 companies eight of which expanded our biotechnology segment both geographically and through product diversification three that formed our protein platforms segment and four of which expanded the reach of our diagnostics segment

 

recognizing the importance of an integrated global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our strategies we have over the past several years unified our brands and recent acquisitions under a single global brand biotechne

 

we are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative highquality scientific tools that allow our customers to make extraordinary discoveries our mission is to build “epic tools for epic science” we intend to build on biotechne’s past accomplishments high product quality reputation and sound financial position by executing strategies that position us to serve as the standard for biological content in the research market and to leverage that leadership position to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets our strategies include

our products and markets 

 

in fiscal 2018 net sales from biotechne’s biotechnology protein platforms and diagnostics segments represented 66 17 and 17 of consolidated net sales respectively financial information relating to biotechne’s segments is incorporated herein by reference to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

 

biotechnology segment 

 

biotechnology segment products 

 

through our biotechnology segment we are one of the worlds leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines and growth factors immunoassays antibodies and related reagents to the biotechnology research community we also sell in situ hybridization media and other cell culture products and reagents our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides high quality tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge that may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies

 

additionally a number of our products have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of human diseases and conditions including cancer autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation neurological disorders and kidney failure immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics in fact we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for a few of our immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices in addition to being useful research tools our rna in situ hybridization assays have diagnostics applications as well and several are currently being cleared with the fda in partnership with diagnostics instrument manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies

 

biotechnology segment customers and distribution methods 

 

we sell our biotechnology products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america europe and china we have a sales and marketing partnership agreement with fisher scientific in order to bolster our market presence in north america and leverage the transactional efficiencies offered by the large fisher organization we also sell through third party distributors in china japan certain eastern european countries and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of biotechnologys net sales during fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016

 

  

biotechnology segment competitors 

 

a number of companies supply the worldwide market for proteinrelated and chemicallybased research and diagnostic reagents including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc peprotech inc abcam plc and thermo fisher scientific inc market success is primarily dependent upon product quality selection price and reputation we believe we are one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine and growth factors in the research market we further believe that the expansion of our product offering the recognized quality of our products and the continued demand for proteinrelated and chemicallybased research reagents will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic markets

 

biotechnology manufacturing 

  

we are not dependent on key or sole source suppliers for most of our products in the biotechnology segment we develop and manufacture the majority of our proteins using recombinant dna technology thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources our antibodies are produced using a variety of technologies including traditional animal immunization and hybridoma technology as well as recombinant antibody techniques our in situ hybridization and chemicalbased small molecule products are synthesized from widely available products we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products

 

the majority of our biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers orders consequently we had no significant backlog of orders for our biotechnology segment products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2017

 

protein platforms segment 

 

proteins are important for understanding disease because they are the functional units that carry out specific tasks in every cell altered levels of certain proteins can prevent the cell from performing its intended function produce the energy it requires maintain its morphology or survive within the tissue however protein analysis is complex given the varied and unique threedimensional structure of the many proteins of interest our protein platforms segment develops manufactures and sells tools to simplify protein analysis while at the same time achieving more quantitative and reproducible results

 

protein platforms segment products 

 

our protein platforms business has an array of platforms useful in various areas of protein analysis

 

developers of biologicsbased drugs are required by regulatory agencies such as fda to develop robust processes to ensure that the specific biologic of interest can be identified and characterized accurately and then consistently and reliably produced our biologics tools help researchers interrogate protein purity and identify contaminants during the development and production of biologics by measuring some elements of protein identity purity and heterogeneity

 

the western blot or western is one of the most widelyused assays for protein analysis and identification today and is used by molecular biologists biochemists and clinicians to determine if a specific protein is present in a sample our simple western platform is a fullyautomated western blot analytical technique that can identify and quantify a protein of interest in a more sensitive automated and less timeintensive manner

 

a common assay used in research and clinical diagnostics is the elisa or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay the simpleplex platform is a transformative immunoassay technology which integrates an innovatively designed microfluidic cartridge with a stateoftheart analyzer to deliver a benchtop immunoassay system that is more sensitive than a manual multiwell place based elisa with none of the traditional challenges of assay design or repeatability

 

the single cell western platform and related reagents perform western blot assays on individual cells versus an entire cell population with this tool customers can elucidate the properties of individual cells to better understand cell behavior that can shape the overall cell population response in a disease or normal state

 

 

protein platforms segment cus tomers and distribution methods 

 

our customers for this segment include researchers in academia as well as by investigators in industry such as pharmaceutical and biotech companies our biologics line of products is used primarily by production and quality control departments at biotech and pharmaceutical companies we sell our protein platforms products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america western europe and japan we also sell through third party distributors in china southern europe and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of protein platforms net sales during fiscal 2018 2017 or 2016

 

protein platforms segment competitors 

  

our simple western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional manual western blot as a result we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional western blot users these competitors include biorad laboratories ge healthcare merck kgaa perkinelmer and thermo fisher scientific all of these vendors provide elements of the traditional work flow similarly our simpleplex platform replaces the traditional manual elisa assay as well as some flow cytometrybased multiplex immunoassays competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for elisas including meso scale discovery perkinelmer thermo fisher luminex millipore molecular devices tecan biotek and biorad laboratories the primary competitors for our biologics instrumentation are agilent technologies danaher and perkinelmer as well as ge healthcare shimadzu thermo fisher and waters we believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality

 

protein platforms segment manufacturing 

 

we manufacture our products for this division at various locations in the united states and canada we manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables components subassemblies and autosamplers used with or included in our systems which are manufactured to our specifications we are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers we conduct all final testing and inspection of our products we have established a quality control program including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures

 

there was no significant backlog of orders for our protein platforms products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2017

  

diagnostics segment 

 

diagnostics segment products 

 

this segment includes blood chemistry and blood gas quality controls hematology instrument controls diagnostic immunoassays and other bulk and custom reagents for the in vitro diagnostic market worldwide often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis to optimize their use in a customers diagnostic assay we supply these reagents in various formats including liquid frozen or in lyophilized form

 

diagnostics segment customers and distribution methods 

  

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for our historical diagnostics products in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 oem agreements accounted for 628 million 607 million and 542 million or 57 57 and 52 of division net sales in each fiscal year respectively we sell some of our diagnostics products directly to customers and in europe and asia also through distributors one oem customer accounted for approximately 12 of the diagnostics divisions net sales during fiscal year 2017 this customer did not amount to 10 or more of the companys consolidated net sales during fiscal year 2017 no customer accounted for more than 10 of the diagnostics division’s net sales during fiscal years 2018 or 2016

 

 

 

 

diagnostics segment competitors 

 

we believe we are the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc for our other control and calibrator products the principal competitors are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation we compete based primarily on product performance quality and price seracare hytest ltd and thermo fisher scientific are additional competitors in the clinical diagnostic manufacturing and reagents markets

 

diagnostics segment manufacturing 

 

the primary raw material for our hematology controls products is whole blood we purchase human blood from commercial blood banks and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business thus far other controls are derived from various bodily fluids or cells from different animal species which are then processed inhouse to isolate the product of interest or from other bulk reagent suppliers that specialize in certain products our other reagent products are manufactured using a variety of suppliers with no supplier representing a material portion of our business

 

most of the hematology controls products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule however the majority of our business in this segment are large orders shipped based on our customers needs we are highly dependent on our customers’ demand and inventory controls consequently our revenues can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year there was no significant backlog of orders for our diagnostics products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2017

  

geographic information 

 

following is financial information relating to geographic areas in thousands 

 

  

  

 

net sales are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer or distributor longlived assets are comprised of land buildings and improvements and equipment net of accumulated depreciation see the description of risks associated with the companys foreign subsidiaries in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

  

products under development 

 

biotechne is engaged in continuous research and development in all of our major product lines we believe that our future success depends to a large extent on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs

 

in fiscal 2018 biotechne introduced approximately 1500 new products we also expect to significantly expand our portfolio of products through acquisitions as well as continued product development in our existing businesses however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

 

  

patents and trademarks 

 

our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections

 

as of june 30 2018 we had rights to 152 granted patents and approximately 82 pending patent applications with respect to our protein platforms segment and the biotechnology segment’s genomic in situ hybridization product line the protection is primarily through pending patent applications and issued patents patent protection if granted generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant we cannot provide assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors products or services

 

in addition to pursuing patents on our products we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets particularly in the biotechnology segment we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees consultants corporate partners and when needed our advisors such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are or will be adequate

 

no assurance can be given that biotechnes products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others biotechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights biotechne typically has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive andor nonexclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented products to the research market in addition certain of our products are covered by licenses from third parties to supplement our own patent portfolio

 

 

biotechne has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its brand and product names biotechne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered

 

seasonality of business 

 

biotechne believes there is some seasonality as a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base particularly for the biotechnology and protein platforms segments a majority of diagnostics segment products are manufactured in large bulk lots and sold on a schedule set by the customer consequently sales for that segment can be unpredictable although not necessarily based on seasonality as a result we can experience material and sometimes unpredictable fluctuations in our revenue for this segment

 

laws and regulations 

 

our operations and some of the products we offer are subject to a number of complex and stringent laws and regulations governing the production marketing handling transportation and distribution of chemicals drugs and other similar products including the operating and security standards of the food and drug administration the drug enforcement administration and various comparable state and foreign agencies as biotechne’s businesses also include export and import activities we are subject to pertinent laws enforced by the us departments of commerce state and treasury while we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to provide competitive distribution services and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition to date none has had a material impact on our operations

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by a reduction in revenue associated with these customers we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

  

employees 

 

through its subsidiaries biotechne employed approximately 2000 fulltime and parttime employees as of june 30 2018

forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake any obligation to update any forwardlooking statements

 

  




 item 1a risk factors 

  

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements

 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the companys business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere see the section entitled “forwardlooking statements” set forth above any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the companys other sec filings could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition

 

it may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for revenue growth in light of competitive challenges 

 

we face significant competition across many of our product lines competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in china india and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors actions may impact the companys future sales and earnings

 

to address this issue we are pursuing a number of strategies to maintain and improve our revenue growth including

 

        

we may not be able to successfully implement these strategies and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business

 

our acquisition growth strategy poses financial management and other risks and challenges 

  

we routinely explore acquiring other businesses and assets and have completed fifteen acquisitions and several investments in the last six years however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons including competition among buyers the high valuations of businesses in our industry the need for regulatory and other approvals and availability of capital there can be no assurance that we will engage in any additional acquisitions or that we will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits in addition acquisitions financed with borrowings could make us more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect our earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense

 

  

our inability to complete acquisitions or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business  

 

our business strategy includes the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services certain acquisitions may be difficult to complete for a number of reasons including the need for antitrust andor other regulatory approvals any acquisition we may complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired company when we do identify and consummate acquisitions we may face financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention difficulty with integrating acquired businesses integration of different corporate cultures increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities indemnities potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities further we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully into our existing businesses make such businesses profitable or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies if any from these acquisitions which could adversely affect our business

 

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired 

 

we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill amortizable intangible assets and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment and declines in the financial condition of our business we may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired any such charge would adversely impact our financial results

 

in addition the companys expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected for example the company has an approximate 8 equity investment in publicly traded chemocentryx inc nasdaq ccxi that is valued at 543 million as of june 30 2018 the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares in fiscal 2017 we also invested and held a minority interest in privatelyheld astute medical inc astute a diagnostics company developing new diagnostics tests relating to kidney injury in fiscal 2018 astute was acquired by a third party and we realized a loss 162 million on our investment

 

significant developments stemming from the us administration or the uk’s referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on us 

 

the us administration has called for substantial changes to trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement nafta and has imposed significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the united states particularly from china the administration has also indicated an intention to ask congress to make significant changes replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act and government negotiationregulation of drug prices paid by government programs changes in us social political regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies governing the health care system and drug prices foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business

  

additionally in a referendum vote held on june 23 2016 the united kingdom uk voted to leave the european union eu subsequently on march 29 2017 the uk invoked article 50 of the lisbon treaty to formally begin the withdrawal process the impact of this action has caused and may continue to cause global economic uncertainty and currency exchange rate fluctuations although it is unknown what the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be disruption to the uk and eu economies as well as greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and the eu and increased regulatory and tax complexities any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our business and financial results particularly since our european headquarters and shipping facilities are currently located in the uk additionally attracting and retaining qualified employees who are citizens of eu countries to our uk facilities may be more difficult given the uncertainties resulting from the uk withdrawal

 

 

changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses  

 

we compete in many markets in which we and our customers must comply with federal state local and international regulations such as environmental health and safety and food and drug regulations we develop configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by those regulations any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses for example many of our instruments are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drugs changes in the us food and drug administration’s regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products

 

we are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers 

 

we have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities in the us and elsewhere and as a result we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts and government contracts may contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts a failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts criminal civil and administrative penalties or debarment

 

we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agencies  

 

we are subject to various local state federal foreign and transnational laws and regulations which include the operating and security standards of the us federal drug administration the fda the us drug enforcement agency the dea the us department of health and human services the dhhs and other comparable agencies and in the future any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us in particular we are subject to laws and regulations concerning current good manufacturing practices and drug safety our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits andor licenses with and may be required to comply with the laws and regulations of the dea the fda the dhhs foreign agencies andor comparable state agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the type of operations and location of product distribution manufacturing and sale the manufacture distribution and marketing of many of our products and services including medical devices and pharma services are subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the fda the dea and other equivalent local state federal and nonus regulatory authorities in addition we are subject to inspections by these regulatory authorities failure by us or by our customers to comply with the requirements of these regulatory authorities including without limitation remediating any inspectional observations to the satisfaction of these regulatory authorities could result in warning letters product recalls or seizures monetary sanctions injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution restrictions on our operations civil or criminal sanctions or withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals including those relating to products or facilities in addition such a failure could expose us to contractual or product liability claims contractual claims from our customers including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as ongoing remediation and increased compliance costs any or all of which could be significant we are the sole manufacturer of a number of products for many of our customers and a negative regulatory event could impact our customers ability to provide products to their customers

 

we are also subject to a variety of federal state local and international laws and regulations that govern among other things the importation and exportation of products the handling transportation and manufacture of substances that could be classified as hazardous and our business practices in the us and abroad such as anticorruption and anticompetition laws any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

  

 

we are subject to financial operating legal and compliance risk associated with global operations 

 

we engage in business globally with approximately 46 of our sales revenue in fiscal 2018 coming from outside the us in addition one of our strategies is to expand geographically particularly in china india and in developing countries both through distribution and through direct operations this subjects us to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions currency fluctuations tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond our control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases

 

the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibited business conduct and damage to our reputation we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if we do not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us

 

we continue to expand our operations in countries with developing economies where it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain aspects of our business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with our internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by our internal policies could have an adverse effect on our business and result in significant fines or penalties

 

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact our revenues and earnings 

 

our biotechnology and protein platforms products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by our customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies our diagnostics segment products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market which relies largely on government healthcarerelated policies and funding changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact us directly or our customers and correspondingly our sales to them several years ago the us and global economies experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover in some parts of the world such downturns and other reductions or delays in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of our products we carry essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

 

 

over the past two years we identified and remediated material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which if recurring could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 

 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act at the beginning of fiscal 2017 management identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of these material weaknesses our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal controlan integrated framework 2013 framework for the years ended june 30 2016 and 2017 in fiscal 2018 we completed a remediation plan that addressed these material weaknesses as we continue to grow and acquire additional business we may fail to implement effective internal controls for our recently acquired operations that result in additional material weaknesses and harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares

 

our success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel and creating a new culture that includes the employees joining through acquisition 

 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production sales and marketing and management personnel are critical to our success our anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel we also operate in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong making employee retention particularly challenging in those locations for example some of our fastest growing businesses are located in northern california and eastern massachusetts both of which currently are experiencing low unemployment and a competitive environment for finding and retaining talent our growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees as we integrate past and future acquisitions and evolve our corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect our business

 

cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of our computer hardware software and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to our reputation andor subject us to costs fines or lawsuits 

  

the integrity and protection of our own data and that of our customers and employees is critical to our business the regulatory environment governing information security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs andor adversely impact our ability to market our products and services to customers although our computer and communications hardware are protected through physical and software safeguards it is still vulnerable to fire storm flood power loss earthquakes telecommunications failures physical or software breakins software viruses and similar events these events could lead to the unauthorized access disclosure and use of nonpublic information the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world as a result we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures if our computer systems are compromised we could be subject to fines damages litigation and enforcement actions customers could curtail or cease using its applications and we could lose trade secrets the occurrence of which could harm our business

 

we are dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights 

 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect and maintain our intellectual property including trade secrets if we fail to protect our intellectual property third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us we may lose our technological or competitive advantage or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property we attempt to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements but those agreements can be breached and if they are there may not be an adequate remedy if trade secrets become publicly known we could lose our competitive position

 

 

we also attempt to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process as of june 30 2018 we owned or exclusively licensed 152 granted us patents and approximately 82 pending patent applications we cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted it is possible that if patents are granted to us others will design around our patented technologies further other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable we may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications any successful thirdparty challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection or is found to be invalid or unenforceable we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors products our competitive position could be adversely affected as could our business both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive

 

we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope coverage and validity of others proprietary rights or to defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement any of which could be timeintensive and costly and may adversely impact our business 

 

our success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate we have obtained and continue to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since we have not conducted a patent infringement study for each of our products it is possible that some of our products may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties

 

we have been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert managements focus from other business concerns if we are found to be infringing the intellectual property of others we could be required to cease certain activities alter our products or processes or pay licensing fees this could cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on us if we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent we may be unable to sell some of our products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if we do not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect our earnings

  

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products which if disrupted could materially impair our business operations 

 

the companys internal quality control packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the companys sales since certain company products must comply with food and drug administration quality system regulations and because in all instances the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason particularly at the minneapolis facility could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the companys future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions

 

our business could be adversely affected by disruptions at our sites 

 

we rely upon our manufacturing operations to produce many of the products we sell and our warehouse facilities to store products pending sale any significant disruption of those operations for any reason such as strikes or other labor unrest power interruptions fire hurricanes or other events beyond our control could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operations in california near major earthquake faults which make us susceptible to earthquake risk although most of our raw materials are available from a number of potential suppliers our operations also depend upon our ability to obtain raw materials at reasonable prices if we are unable to obtain the materials we need at a reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our products or we may not be able to produce certain of these products at a marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations

 

 

fluctuations in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 

 

as a global company we are subject to taxation in numerous countries states and other jurisdictions in particular we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or related authoritative interpretations in the united states including tax reform under the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” signed by the president of the united states on december 22 2017 which includes broad and complex changes to the united states tax code and the state tax response to the tax act reasonable estimates were used in determining several of the components of the impact of the tax act including our fiscal 2018 deferred income tax activity and the amount of post1986 foreign deferred earnings subject to the repatriation toll charge in addition certain provisions of the tax act including the base erosion antiabuse tax beat and the provision designed to tax currently global intangible lowtax income gilti are effective for the company in the year beginning july 1 2018 we are still analyzing certain aspects of the tax act and refining our calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of our deferred tax balances and the amount of the repatriation toll charge liability and ultimately cause us to revise our initial estimates in future periods in addition changes in interpretations assumptions and guidance regarding the tax act as well as the potential for technical corrections could have a material impact on our effective tax rate in future periods

 

in preparing our financial statements we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the countries states and other jurisdictions in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factors including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country changes in accounting for income taxes and recently enacted and future changes in tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows

 

because we rely heavily on thirdparty packagedelivery services a significant disruption in these services or significant increases in prices may disrupt our ability to ship products increase our costs and lower our profitability 

 

we ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery companies such as fedex in the us and dhl in europe if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to experience a major work stoppage preventing our products from being delivered in a timely fashion or causing us to incur additional shipping costs we could not pass on to our customers our costs could increase and our relationships with certain of our customers could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these thirdparty packagedelivery providers were to increase prices and we were not able to find comparable alternatives or make adjustments in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected

 

as a multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 

 

international markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates takes on different forms international revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates could adversely affect our reported revenues and profitability when translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes these fluctuations could also adversely affect the demand for products and services provided by us as a multinational corporation our businesses occasionally invoice thirdparty customers in currencies other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movements in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flows and our results of operations as our international sales grow exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a larger effect on our financial results in fiscal 2018 currency translation had a favorable effect of 127 million on revenues due to the weakening of the us dollar relative to other currencies in which the company sells products and services

 

we have entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect us make us more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent us from funding our expansion strategy 

  

in connection with the acquisition of exosome diagnostics on august 1 2018 we used a new credit facility governed by a credit agreement entered into on july 28 2018 the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of 600 million which can be increased by an additional 200 million subject to certain conditions and a term loan of 250 million borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of august 24 2018 the company had drawn 330 million under the credit agreement

 

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as

 

    

 

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions

  

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends

 

our share price will fluctuate 

  

over the last several years stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects in addition to the risk factors discussed above the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by

 

       

dividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future 

  

for the past 10 years our board has consistently declared quarterly dividends of 025 to 032 cents per share in the future our board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth repurchase shares or conserve capital resources

in fiscal 2018 biotechnology segment net sales increased 16 compared to fiscal 2017 organic growth for the segment was 9 for the fiscal year with acquisitions contributing 4 and foreign currency translation having a favorable impact of 3 continued strength from acd a fiscal 2017 acquisition and the proteins and assays product categories drove growth

 

in fiscal 2018 the protein platforms segment net sales increased 22 compared to fiscal 2017 organic growth for the segment was 20 with foreign currency translation having a favorable impact of 2 growth was broadbased and led by continued market demand for simple western wes instruments and consumables and the simple plex ella product lines

gross margins 

  

consolidated gross margins were 672 665 and 675 in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2018 2017 2016 and prior years under purchase accounting inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles adjusted gross margins were 715 712 and 708 in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively

 

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales is as follows

 

  

 

fluctuations in adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net sales have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix we expect that in the future gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions

 

management uses adjusted operating results to monitor and evaluate performance of the company’s three business segments since these results are used for this purpose they are also considered to be prepared in accordance with gaap segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were as follows 

 

  

 

the decrease in the biotechnology segment’s gross margin percentage for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to mix of product sales made in this segment the improvements in the protein platforms and diagnostics gross margin percentages for fiscal 2018 as compared to fiscal 2017 were due to higher volume leverage and operational productivity

 

 

the biotechnology improvement for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to higher volume leverage and operational productivity the diagnostics and protein platforms segment gross margin percentages for fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by lower volume leverage and margin mix of product sales

  

selling general and administrative expenses 

 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 402 million 20 and 596 million 42 in fiscal 2018 and 2017 respectively

income taxes for fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 were at effective rates of 02 320 and 292 respectively of consolidated earnings before income taxes the effective rate for june 30 2018 decreased by 322 compared to the prior year the decrease in the company’s tax rate for fiscal 2018 was due to the impact of discrete items primarily the net tax benefit of 330 million related to government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” this net tax benefit consisted of 365 million due to the remeasurement of the company’s deferred tax accounts to reflect the us federal corporate tax rate reduction impact to our net deferred tax balances offset by expense for the repatriation tax of 33 million also impacting the company’s fiscal 2018 effective tax rate was a 22 million tax benefit related to stock option exercises offset by a net discrete tax expense of 42 million related to the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not a tax deductible expense

 

the effective rate for june 30 2017 increased by 28 compared to the prior year the increase was primarily due to unfavorable discrete events in fiscal 2017 related to the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not a tax deductible expense the company recognized net expense related to discrete tax items of 38 million in fiscal 2017 including 45 million in expense related to the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not a tax deductible expense there were no material discrete tax items in fiscal 2016

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and nongaap tax rate applied to the identified nongaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018 is due primarily to recording the items attributable to the new tax legislation in the us which resulted in a 330 million tax benefit offsetting this benefit is the impact of the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not tax deductible for the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 the company recorded acquisition related expense of 201 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration

 

the difference between the reported gaap tax rate and nongaap tax rate applied to the identified nongaap adjustments for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 is primarily a result of the revaluation of contingent consideration which is not tax deductible for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 the company recorded acquisition related expense of 184 million related to the change in fair value of contingent consideration

critical accounting policies 

  

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

 

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies investors should also refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k

  

business combinations 

  

we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the acquisition the calculations used to determine the fair value of the longlived assets acquired primarily intangible assets can be complex and require significant judgment we weigh many factors when completing these estimates including but not limited to the nature of the acquired company’s business its competitive position strengths and challenges its historical financial position and performance estimated customer retention rates discount rates and future plans for the combined entity we may also engage independent valuation specialists when necessary to assist in the fair value calculations for significant acquired longlived assets

 

the fair value of acquired technology is estimated using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the technology to estimate the royalty savings the fair value of acquired technology may also be estimated using the cost of reproduction method under which the primary components of the technology are identified and the estimated cost to reproduce the technology is calculated based on historical data provided by the acquirees the fair value of trade names is estimated using the relief from royalty method which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the trade name assumed royalty rates are applied to the projected revenues for the remaining useful life of the trade name to estimate the royalty savings we generally estimate the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multiperiod excess earnings method this valuation model estimates revenues and cash flows derived from the asset and then deducts portions of the cash flow that can be attributed to supporting assets such as a brand name or fixed assets that contributed to the generation of the cash flows the resulting cash flow which is attributable solely to the customer list asset is then discounted at a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the asset to calculate a present value the fair value of acquired customer relationships may also be estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the assets assumptions used in these calculations include samecustomer revenue growth rates and estimated customer retention rates based on the acquirees historical information

 

 

we estimate the fair value of liabilities for contingent consideration by discounting to present value the probability weighted contingent payments expected to be made assumptions used in these calculations include discount rates projected financial results of the acquired businesses based on our most recent internal forecasts and factors indicating the probability of achieving the forecasted results the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis

 

we are also required to estimate the useful lives of the acquired intangible assets which determines the amount of acquisitionrelated amortization expense we will record in future periods each reporting period we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our amortizable intangibles to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization

 

while we use our best estimates and assumptions our fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings

 

the judgments required in determining the estimated fair values and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income for example different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ consequently to the extent a longerlived asset is ascribed greater value than a shorterlived asset net income in a given period may be higher additionally assigning a lower value to amortizable intangibles would result in a higher amount assigned to goodwill as goodwill is not amortized this would benefit net income in a given period although goodwill is subject to annual impairment analysis

  

impairment of goodwill 

  

goodwill 

  

goodwill was 5979 million as of june 30 2018 which represented 375 of total assets goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could indicate a possible impairment

 

to analyze goodwill for impairment we must assign our goodwill to individual reporting units identification of reporting units includes an analysis of the components that comprise each of our operating segments which considers among other things the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information components of an operating segment are aggregated to form one reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics we periodically review our reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which we operate our business

    

 

2018 and 2017 goodwill impairment analyses 

 

in completing our 2018 and 2017 annual goodwill impairment analyses we elected to perform a quantitative assessment for all of our reporting units a quantitative assessment involves comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill to its estimated fair value carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of the reporting unit which often requires the allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units in accordance with asu 201704 a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit in determining the fair values of our reporting units we utilized the income approach the income approach is a valuation technique under which we estimated future cash flows using the reporting units financial forecast from the perspective of an unrelated market participant using historical trending and internal forecasting techniques we projected revenue and applied our fixed and variable cost experience rates to the projected revenue to arrive at the future cash flows a terminal value was then applied to the projected cash flow stream future estimated cash flows were discounted to their present value to calculate the estimated fair value the discount rate used was the valueweighted average of our estimated cost of capital derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit we were required to estimate a number of factors including projected operating results terminal growth rates economic conditions anticipated future cash flows the discount rate and the allocation of shared or corporate items

 

because our 2018 and 2017 quantitative analyses included all of our reporting units the summation of our reporting units fair values was compared to our consolidated fair value as indicated by our market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our calculations

 

the quantitative assessment completed as of june 30 2018 and 2017 indicated that all of the reporting units had a substantial amount of headroom this impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows as well as our selected discount rate changes in the reporting units results forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units

 

2016 goodwill impairment analysis 

 

the company used a qualitative test for all reporting units during the fourth quarter for fiscal year 2016 the company elected to utilize a quantitative test for the protein platforms reporting unit for fiscal year 2016 using the previously described income approach given that this was a newer reporting unit created primarily through acquisitions the qualitative analyses for our other reporting units completed during 2016 evaluated factors including but not limited to economic market and industry conditions cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units in completing these assessments we noted no changes in events or circumstances which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount based on the testing performed for the protein platforms reporting unit fair value exceeded carrying value by a substantial amount and no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was necessary

  

there has been no impairment of goodwill since the adoption of financial accounting standards board “fasb” asc 350 guidance for goodwill and other intangibles on july 1 2002

nongaap financial measures 

  

this annual report on form 10k including “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in item 7 contains financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap these nongaap measures include

 

     

we provide these measures as additional information regarding our operating results we use these nongaap measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions including with respect to incentive compensation we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency with respect to our results of operations and that these measures are useful for periodtoperiod comparison of results

 

our nongaap financial measures for adjusted gross margin adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis exclude the costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory amortization of acquisition intangibles and acquisition related expenses the company excludes amortization of purchased intangible assets and purchase accounting adjustments including costs recognized upon the sale of acquired inventory and acquisitionrelated expenses from this measure because they occur as a result of specific events and are not reflective of our internal investments the costs of developing producing supporting and selling our products and the other ongoing costs to support our operating structure additionally these amounts can vary significantly from period to period based on current activity

 

the company’s nongaap adjusted operating margin and adjusted net earnings in total and on a per share basis also excludes stock based compensation expense restructuring impairments of equity method investments gain and losses from investments and certain adjustments to income tax expense stock based compensation is excluded from nongaap adjusted earnings because of the nature of this charge specifically the varying available valuation methodologies subjective assumptions and the variety of award types impairments of equity investments are excluded as we do not have significant influence over these investments and they are not part of our day to day operating decisions additionally gains and losses from other investments that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability are excluded costs related to restructuring activities including reducing overhead and consolidating facilities are excluded because we believe they are not indicative of our normal operating costs the company independently calculates a nongaap adjusted tax rate to be applied to the identified nongaap adjustments considering the impact of discrete items on these adjustments and the jurisdictional mix of the adjustments in addition the tax impact of other discrete and nonrecurring charges which impact our reported gaap tax rate are adjusted from net earnings we believe these tax items can significantly affect the periodoverperiod assessment of operating results and not necessarily reflect costs andor income associated with historical trends and future results

 

the company periodically reassesses the components of our nongaap adjustments for changes in how we evaluate our performance changes in how we make financial and operational decisions and considers the use of these measures by our competitors and peers to ensure the adjustments are still relevant and meaningful

as previously disclosed in item 9a of part ii of our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2017 management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june 30 2017 due to material weaknesses over monitoring and information and communication with respect to general information technology controls gitcs for certain of our information technology platforms and flow of information from the component locations to allow for effective monitoring as a consequence we did not have effective control activities over the establishment of gitcs for certain information technology it platforms primarily at recently acquired locations and which impacted manual controls that rely on data produced by or maintained within these it system applications were also ineffective

 

to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described in item 9a of part ii of our annual report on form 10k for fiscal year 2017 we performed a comprehensive review of procedures and related controls we hired a new internal audit director and expanded the existing internal audit to improve our monitoring processes we conducted various trainings and meetings to ensure there was clear flow of information from subsidiaries to the corporate headquarters as a result of our procedures new process controls were designed and implemented during fiscal year 2018 in addition management focused on frequent testing of information technology general controls to validate continued operating effectiveness

biotechnology segment 

  

through our biotechnology segment we are one of the world’s leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines growth factors immunoassays antibodies and related reagents to the biotechnology research community our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides new tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge which may lead to a more complete understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies 

  

  

biotechnology segment products 

  

proteins we develop and manufacture inhouse a range of cytokines growth factors and enzymes extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology we produce and characterize all protein products to a high degree of purity and biological activity the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that tiny amounts of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues cytokines are intercellular messengers and as a result act as signaling agents by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell behavior enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins and in turn affect cell behavior and function additionally both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases and conditions including cancer alzheimer’s arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation aids and influenza 

  

antibodies antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that recognize and bind to target molecules we produce our polyclonal antibodies in animals primarily goats sheep and rabbits purifying them from the animals’ blood we derive monoclonal antibodies from immortalized rodent cell lines using hybridoma technology isolating them from cell culture medium or we manufacture them through recombinant dna technology the flow cytometry product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits that are used to determine the immunophenotypic properties of cells from different tissues 

  

 

 

 

immunoassays we market a variety of immunoassays on different testing platforms including microtiterplate based kits sold under the trade name quantikine® multiplex immunoassays based on encoded bead technology and immunoassays based on planar spotted surfaces and microfluidicbased multiplex immunoassays on our automated testing platform researchers use these immunoassay products to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine protein quantification is an integral component of basic research as potential diagnostic tools for various diseases and as a valuable indicator of the effects of new therapeutic compounds in the drug discovery process immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin b2m immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices 

  

small molecule chemicallybased products these products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists antagonists andor inhibitors of various biological functions used in concert with other company products they provide additional tools to elucidate key pathways of cellular functions and can provide insight into the drug discovery process 

  

biotechnology segment customers and distribution methods 

  

we sell our biotechnology products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america western europe and china we have a sales and marketing partnership agreement with fisher scientific in order to bolster our market presence in north america and leverage the transactional efficiencies offered by the large fisher organization we also sell through third party distributors in china japan southern and eastern europe and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of biotechnology’s net sales during fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 

  

biotechnology segment competitors 

  

a number of companies supply the worldwide market for proteinrelated and chemicallybased research reagents including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc peprotech inc santa cruz biotechnology inc abcam plc thermo fisher scientific inc cayman chemical company and enzo biochem inc market success is primarily dependent upon product quality selection and reputation we believe we are one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research market we further believe that the expanding line of our products their recognized quality and the growing demand for proteinrelated and chemicallybased research reagents will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market 

  

biotechnology segment manufacturing 

  

we develop and manufacture the majority of our cytokines using recombinant dna technology thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources tocris chemicalbased products are synthesized from widely available products we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products 

  

the majority of our biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders consequently we had no significant backlog of orders for our biotechnology segment products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2015 

  

clinical controls segment 

  

our original business in this segment was focused on controls and calibrators for hematology clinical instruments with the acquisition of bionostics in fiscal 2014 and cliniqa in fiscal 2016 we expanded this segment to include blood chemistry and blood gases quality controls diagnostic immunoassays as well as other bulk and custom reagents for the in vitro diagnostic market our biospacific brand product revenues are also now included in this segment as of fiscal 2016 and have been reclassified in prior years for comparative purposes 

  

clinical controls segment products 

  

controls and calibrators proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patient’s blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments we derive our hematology controls and calibrators from various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized these control and calibrator products ensure that hematology instruments are performing accurately and reliably 

  

 

 

 

we believe our products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of our competitors we also offer clinical controls for blood glucose and blood gas devices as well as coagulation device control products 

  

bulk reagents for diagnostic use we also develop and supply bulk purified proteins enzymes diseasestate plasmas infectious disease antigens and processed serums to the clinical diagnostic industry worldwide often we manufacture these reagents on a custom basis to optimize their use in a customer’s diagnostic assay we supply these reagents in various formats including liquid lyophilized and powder form 

  

clinical controls segment customers and distribution methods 

  

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for our clinical controls products in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 oem agreements accounted for 542 million 411 million and 412 million respectively or 8 9 and 12 of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year respectively the increase in fiscal 2016 was the result of the acquisition of cliniqa we sell our clinical control products directly to customers and in europe and asia also through distributors one oem customer accounted for approximately 13 and 14 of clinical controls’ net sales during fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively this customer did not amount to 10 or more of the companys consolidated revenue during these years

  

clinical controls segment competitors 

  

competition is intense in the clinical controls business the market is composed of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products and independent blood control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers the principal clinical control competitors for our products in this segment are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc streck inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation we believe we are the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc we compete based primarily on product performance quality and price seracare hytest ltd and thermo fisher scientific represent additional competitors in the clinical diagnostic manufacturing and reagents markets 

  

clinical controls segment manufacturing 

  

the primary raw material for our hematology controls products is whole blood we purchase human blood from commercial blood banks and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants after we receive raw blood we separate it into its cellular components and then process and stabilize it although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business biotechne does not perform its own pathogen testing as most suppliers test all human blood collected other controls are derived from various bodily fluids collected which are then processed in house to isolate the product of interest or from other bulk reagent suppliers that specialize in certain products 

  

the majority of the hematology controls products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule for the remainder of our clinical controls products the shipments are determined by our customers’ needs which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year there was no significant backlog of orders for our clinical control products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2015 

  

protein platforms segment 

  

proteins are important for understanding disease because they are the functional units that carry out specific tasks in every cell altered levels of certain proteins can prevent the cell from performing its intended function produce the energy it requires maintain its morphology or survive within the tissue however proteins analysis is complex given the varied and unique three dimensional structure of the many proteins of interest our protein platforms segment develops manufactures and sells tools to simplify protein analysis while at the same time achieving more quantitative and reproducible results 

  

protein platforms segment products 

  

the simple western platform the western blot or western is one of the most widelyused assays for protein analysis and identification today unchanged since its invention in 1979 the western assay is used by molecular biologists biochemists and clinicians to determine if a specific protein is present in a sample the western blot is able to report a protein’s molecular weight as well as its identity via an antibody mediated reaction our simple western platform is a fullyautomated western blot analytical technique that can identify and quantify a protein of interest in a sample the simple western product lines simplify the workflow transforming the western into a real protein analytical tool by providing truly quantitative and high quality data our simple western products are more sensitive than a traditional western and in conjunction with the lower sample volume requirements and the ability to run multiple proteins simultaneously this technology offers many competitive advantages 

  

 

 

 

simpleplex platform a common assay used in research and clinical diagnostics is the elisa or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay the simpleplex platform is a transformative immunoassay technology which integrates an innovatively designed microfluidic cartridge with a stateoftheart analyzer to deliver a benchtop immunoassay system that is more sensitive than elisa with none of the traditional challenges of assay design or repeatability simpleplex assays are fully automated multianalyte immunoassays that permit the customer to run multiple samples while interrogating multiple analytes in approximately one hour while leveraging the large biological content menu that has been developed over 30 years we believe the simpleplex technology along with other immunoassay platforms offered by biotechne represents the most comprehensive line of immunoassay products to meet customers’ complete workflow in their research and clinical protein applications 

  

biologics instrumentation 

  

biologics are complex proteinbased therapeutics and are transforming the pharmaceutical industry and treatment of many diseases biologic drugs are very effective targeted therapeutics for diseases such as arthritis cancer and diabetes and their number in development is increasing because of a variety of advances in biochemistry immunology and biotechnology biologics can be monoclonal antibodies recombinant proteins and vaccines developers of biologics are required by regulatory agencies such as fda to develop robust processes to ensure that the specific biologic of interest can be identified and characterized accurately and then consistently and reliably produced as a result a suite of complementary analytical approaches are utilized to measure attributes such as identity biological potency purity safety and impurities these analytical approaches are used throughout the product development process spanning initial discovery expression formulation process development quality control and final release our biologics tools help researchers interrogate protein purity and identify contaminants during the development and production of biologics our ice3 system is an analytical tool that measures the charge heterogeneity of proteins our microflow imaging or mfi platform measures the size shape count and concentration of particles within the 1 µm to 300 µm size range that may be present in biologic solutions in fiscal 2016 we launched a new biologics product maurice which profiles identity purity and hetergenity of biopharmaceuticals in one system 

  

single cell western platform with the acquisition of zephyrus biosciences in march 2016 we now sell an instrument and related reagents to perform western blot assays on individual cells versus an entire cell population we believe that the zephyrus technology is a tool to elucidate the properties of individual cells to better understand cell behavior that can shape the overall cell population response in a disease or normal state 

  

protein platforms segment customers and distribution methods 

  

we sell our protein platforms products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america western europe and japan we also sell through third party distributors in china southern europe and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of protein platforms’ net sales during fiscal 2016 2015 or 2014 

  

protein platforms segment competitors 

  

our simple western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional western blot as a result we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional western blot users these competitors include biorad laboratories ge healthcare merck kgaa perkinelmer and thermo fisher scientific all of these vendors provide elements of the traditional work flow similarly our simpleplex platform replaces the traditional elisa assay as well as some flowbased multiplex assays competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for elisas including meso scale discovery perkinelmer thermo fisher luminex millipore molecular devices tecan biotek and biorad laboratories the primary competitors for our biologics instrumentation are agilent technologies danaher and perkinelmer as well as ge healthcare shimadzu thermo fisher and waters we believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality 

  

protein platforms segment manufacturing 

  

we manufacture our simple western products at our facility in san jose california and minneapolis minnesota our biologics instruments and consumables are manufactured at our facilities in toronto and ottawa both located in ontario canada we manufacture our simple plex products at our facility in wallingford connecticut we manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables components subassemblies and autosamplers used with or included in our systems which are manufactured to our specifications we are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers we conduct all final testing and inspection of our products we have established a quality control program including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures

acquisitions pose financial management and other risks and challenges 

  

the company routinely explores acquiring other businesses and assets during fiscal 2015 the company acquired novus proteinsimple and cyvek and in fiscal 2016 we acquired cliniqa corporation and zephyrus biosciences however we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons including competition among buyers the high valuations of businesses in our industry the need for regulatory and other approvals and availability of capital when we do identify and consummate acquisitions we may face financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention difficulty with integrating acquired businesses integration of different corporate cultures increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities indemnities potential disputes with the sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities there can be no assurance that the company will engage in any additional acquisitions or that the company will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits in addition acquisitions financed with borrowings could make the company more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect the company’s earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense 

  

we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired 

  

we are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our amortizable intangible assets including goodwill and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets including goodwill or assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment and declines in the financial condition of our business we have recorded and may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired any such charge would adversely impact our financial results 

  

the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights 

  

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to protect and maintain its intellectual property including trade secrets if we fail to protect our intellectual property third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us we may lose our technological or competitive advantage or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property the company attempts to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements but those agreements can be breached and if they are there may not be an adequate remedy if trade secrets become publicly known the company could lose its competitive position 

  

the company also attempts to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process as of june 30 2016 we owned or exclusively licensed 76 granted us patents and approximately 70 pending patent applications we cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted it is possible that if patents are granted to us others will design around our patented technologies further other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable we may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications any successful thirdparty challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection or is found to be invalid or unenforceable we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors’ products our competitive position could be adversely affected as could our business both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 

  

 

 

    

we may be involved in disputes to determine the scope coverage and validity of others’ proprietary rights or to defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement any of which could be timeintensive and costly and may adversely impact our business 

  

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate the company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties 

  

the company has been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that the company is infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus from other business concerns if the company is found to be infringing the intellectual property of others it could be required to cease certain activities alter its products or processes or pay licensing fees this would cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company if the company is unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent it may be unable to sell some of its products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if the company does not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect the company’s earnings 

  

the company has entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect the company make it more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent it from funding its expansion strategy 

  

in connection with the acquisition of advanced cell diagnostics on august 1 2016 the company entered into a new revolving credit facility governed by a credit agreement dated july 28 2016 the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of 400 million borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of august 26 2016 the company had drawn 250 million under the credit agreement 

  

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as 

  

   

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions 

  

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends 

    

we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 

  

we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records record transactions provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements the implementation of the new erp system requires the investment of significant financial and human resources we completed the first phase of implementation in july of 2016 during this initial implementation which covered most of our operations and accounting systems at our headquarters in minneapolis we experienced some disruption in our shipping and invoicing activities we believe will impact revenues in the short term as we continue expanding the use of our new erp system to additional locations we may experience further difficulties any further disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

  

 

 

    

we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could if not remediated harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the securities exchange act as disclosed in item 9a management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting involving the effectiveness of t he control environment and risk assessment information communication and monitoring processes resulting in a lack of effective controls over general information technology controls gitc for certain applications a material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of this material weakness our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organization of the treadway commission in internal control—an integrated framework 2013 framework we are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material weakness any failure to implement effective internal controls could harm our operating results or cause usto fail to meet our reporting obligations inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock and may require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control system

 

the company is subject to risk associated with global operations 

  

the company engages in business globally with approximately 37 of the company’s sales revenue in fiscal 2016 coming from outside the us this subjects the company to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions currency fluctuations tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond the company’s control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases 

  

the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in the company’s business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibited business conduct and damage to the company’s reputation the company incurs additional legal compliance costs associated with its global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if it does not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us 

  

the company conducts and plans to grow its business in developing markets which may cause additional operational and legal risk 

  

the company’s efforts to grow its businesses depend to a degree on its success in developing market share in additional geographic markets including but not limited to china in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than the company’s other markets for example a recent incident involving a chinese university student who died after seeking treatment for a rare form of cancer from a treatment center identified through an internet search has led to a government investigation and a temporary halt to certain cancer treatments until more comprehensive safety regulations can be implemented leading to lower sales growth in certain products offered by the company operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements 

  

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although the company implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of the company’s employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which the company outsources certain aspects of its business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with the company’s internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by the company’s internal policies could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and result in significant fines or penalties 

  

 

 

    

the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates and changes to the strength of foreign governments and economic conditions 

  

approximately 23 of the company’s net sales in fiscal 2016 were made through its foreign subsidiaries which transact their sales in foreign currencies any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could therefore negatively affect the company’s revenues and earnings in june of 2016 britain voted to exit the european union the uncertainty over the consequences of that decision has negatively impacted the value of the british pound and has led to some disruption in economic activity in the uk and in the eurozone region the company maintains its european headquarters and shipping facilities in the uk it is also unclear how and whether the british vote to depart the european union will impact our ability to conduct business cost effectively from our uk headquarters moreover the financial crisis faced by several eurozone countries and the ongoing economic instability in that region may lead to reduced spending on health care and research by eurozone governments which could adversely affect the company’s european sales as well as its revenues financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company’s success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

  

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production sales and marketing and management personnel are critical to the company’s success the company’s anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the company also operates in several geographic locations where competition for talent is strong making employee retention particularly challenging in those locations the company’s growth by acquisition also creates challenges in retaining employees as the company integrates acquisitions and evolves its corporate culture to incorporate the new workforces some employees may not find such integration or cultural changes appealing the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings 

  

the company’s biotechnology and protein platforms products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by the company’s customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the company’s clinical controls products are intended primarily for the medical diagnostics market which relies largely on government healthcarerelated policies and funding changes in government reimbursement for certain diagnostic tests or reductions in overall healthcare spending could negatively impact our customers and correspondingly our sales to them the us and global economies recently experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover in japan government investment in biotechnology research remains weak such downturns and other reductions or delays in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the company’s products the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 

  

the industry segments in which we operate are very competitive more so recently due to consolidation trends 

  

the company faces significant competition across all of its product lines and in each market in which it operates competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology and diagnostics industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in china india and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’ actions may impact the company’s future sales and earnings 

  

the company’s future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 

  

one element of the company’s growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases as a result the company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs new product development requires planning designing and testing at both technological and manufacturingprocess levels and may require significant research and development expenditures there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that the company may seek to develop in the future will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance there can also be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products in a more timely and cost effective manner than the company if the company does not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies the company’s technologies will become outdated rendering the company’s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive to the extent the company fails to introduce new and innovative products the company may lose market share to its competitors which may be difficult or impossible to regain 

  

 

 

      

the company’s business is subject to governmental laws and regulations 

  

the company’s operations are subject to regulation by various us federal state and international agencies laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the company’s operations including design development manufacturing labeling selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the company’s operations and ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of the company’s products if the company fails to comply with any of these regulations it may become subject to fines penalties or actions that could impact development manufacturing and distribution andor increase costs or reduce sales the approval process applicable to clinical control products and certain immunoassay kits that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the company’s revenues 

  

as a multinational corporation the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of us federal state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions from time to time new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments 

  

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products 

  

the company’s internal quality control packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the company’s sales since certain company products must comply with food and drug administration quality system regulations and because in all instances the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason particularly at the minneapolis facility could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the company’s future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions 

  

the design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls litigation or alerts relating to the company’s products a recall could result in significant costs and damage to the company’s reputation which could reduce demand particularly for certain of its regulated products 

  

disruptions in the supply and cost of raw materials could reduce the company’s earnings cash flow and ability to meet customers’ needs 

  

the company’s products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however some of the company’s products are available only from a single supplier if such suppliers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to supply these materials for any reason such failures could have a material adverse impact on the company’s product sales and business in addition price increases for raw materials could adversely affect the company’s earnings and cash flow 

  

increased exposure to product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

  

product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products offered by the company’s customers currently these risks are primarily borne by the company’s customers as the company’s products and services are further integrated into customers’ production processes the company may become increasingly exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of its products or services is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects there can be no assurance that a future product liability claim or series of claims brought against the company would not have an adverse effect on the company’s business or the results of operations the company’s business may be materially and adversely affected by a successful product liability claim or claims in excess of any insurance coverage that it may have in addition product liability claims regardless of their merits could be costly divert management’s attention and adversely affect the company’s reputation and demand for its products 

  

any such product liability claims brought against the company could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of the company’s insurance coverage although the company carries product liability insurance it cannot be certain that current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

  

the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in chemocentryx inc and other companies in which it does not have a majority interest the success of which is largely out of the company’s control 

  

the company’s expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company’s business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected 

  

the company has an approximate 14 equity investment in chemocentryx inc ccxi that is valued at 286 million on the company’s june 30 2016 consolidated balance sheet ccxi is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and commercializing orallyadministered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and cancers the development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking ccxi is dependent on a limited number of products must achieve favorable clinical trial results obtain regulatory and marketing approval for these products ccxi has also incurred significant losses and has yet to achieve profitability 

  

the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares these factors make it possible that the company could experience future dilution or lose its original 295 million investment in ccxi at august 26 2016 the market value of the company’s investment in ccxi was approximately 318 million 

  

 

 

 

cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s computer hardware software and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to the company’s reputation andor subject the company to costs fines or lawsuits 

  

the integrity and protection of the company’s own data and that of its customers and employees is critical to the company’s business the regulatory environment governing information security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase the company’s operating costs andor adversely impact the company’s ability to market its products and services to customers although the company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards it is still vulnerable to fire storm flood power loss earthquakes telecommunications failures physical or software breakins software viruses and similar events these events could lead to the unauthorized access disclosure and use of nonpublic information the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world as a result the company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures if the company’s computer systems are compromised it could be subject to fines damages litigation and enforcement actions customers could curtail or cease using its applications and the company could lose trade secrets the occurrence of which could harm its business 

  

we are now subject to regulations related to “conflict minerals” which may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

  

with our acquisitions of proteinsimple and cyvek in fiscal 2015 we now manufacture and sell products that may be covered under the securities and exchange commission’s sec rule regarding “conflict minerals” we are now required to determine whether these products contain conflict minerals and if so to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc or an adjoining country under the regulations we are required to file a report with the sec by may 31 2017 to disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the drc or an adjoining country complying with this regulation could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tantalum tin gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so

results of operations 

  

reorganization of segments 

as previously disclosed beginning in fiscal 2016 the clinical controls segment includes the financial results of the company’s biospacific business historically this business was managed and reported as part of the biotechnology segment the recent acquisition of cliniqa and its commonality of customer and end markets with biospacific influenced this management and reporting change all comparisons to prior periods reflect the new reporting structure as if it existed in the prior reporting periods 

  

net sales 

  

consolidated organic net sales exclude the impact of net sales contributed by companies acquired during the fiscal year and the effect of the change from the prior year in exchange rates used to convert sales in foreign currencies primarily british pound sterling euros and chinese yuan into us dollars

gross margins 

  

consolidated gross margins were 68 68 and 70 in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively gaap reported consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2016 2015 2014 and prior years under purchase accounting inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles adjusted gross margins were 71 72 and 74 in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales is as follows 

  

   

fluctuations in adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net sales have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix in fiscal 2016 the biggest impact to gross margin as compared to fiscal 2015 was the change in product mix associated with the aquisition of cliniqa in fiscal 2015 the biggest impact to gross margin as compared to fiscal 2014 was the change in product mix associated with the acquisitions of novus proteinsimple and cyvek we expect that in the future gross margins will continue to be impacted by the mix of our portfolio growing at different rates as well as future acquisitions 

  

segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were as follows 

  

   

the biotechnology segment gross margin percentage for fiscal 2016 improved when compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to less costs associated with the fair value inventory adjustment associated with acquisition accounting of prior acquisitions 

  

the clinical controls segment gross margin percentage for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was negatively impacted by purchase accounting and intangible asset amortization related to the acquisition of bionostics in july 2013 and cliniqa in july 2015 gross margin percentage improvements in fiscal 2016 when compared to fiscal 2015 was mostly driven by operational productivity

to meet strict customer quality standards the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins antibodies and its chemicallybased products these products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met in addition the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale the manufacturing process for these products therefore has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a twoyear forecast and its chemicallybased products on a fiveyear forecast the establishment of a twoyear or fiveyear forecast requires considerable judgment inventory quantities in excess of the forecast are not valued due to uncertainty over salability the value of protein antibody and chemicallybased product inventory not valued at june 30 2016 was 24 million 

  

 

 

 

the fair value of inventory purchased through acquisitions was determined based on quantities acquired selling prices at the date of acquisition and management’s assumptions regarding inventory having future value and the costs to sell such inventories inventory purchased in fiscal 2016 through the acquisition of cliniqa was increased 09 million

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 

  

when a business is acquired the purchase price is allocated as applicable between tangible assets identifiable intangible assets and goodwill determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets requires significant estimates the fair value of intangible assets acquired including developed technologies trade names customer relationships and noncompete agreements were based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows using a relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings method with consideration to other factors including an independent valuation of management’s assumptions intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years the company reviews the carrying amount of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 311 million at june 30 2016 

  

goodwill recognized in connection with a business acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units the company’s annual assessment included a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value a significant change in the company’s market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed as of june 30 2016 as the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values goodwill at june 30 2016 was 431 million 

  

valuation of investments

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures 

about market risk 

  

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 24 of the company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016 were made in foreign currencies including 7 in euro 6 in british pound sterling 6 in chinese yuan and the remaining 5 in other european and asian currencies as a result the company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling and the chinese yuan as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company’s foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation in fiscal 2016 for example the average exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar changed by 10 on resulting in consolidated net sales that were lower in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

  

monthend exchange rates between the british pound sterling euro and chinese yuan and the us dollar which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods were as follows 

  

   

the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements but receivable or payable in another currency 

  

the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in “other nonoperating expense net” in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of “accumulated other comprehensive income loss”

notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses management believes the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k fairly present in all material respects our financial condition results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

  

b m anagement’s r eport on i nternal c ontrol over f inancial r eporting 

  

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016 in making this assessment our management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “internal control—integrated framework 2013” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving its control objectives 

  

a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

  

we acquired cliniqa on july 8 2015 and zephyrus on march 14 2016 cliniqa and zephyrus represented approximately 90 of our total assets and 53 of our total revenues as of and for the year ended june 30 2016 we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016 internal control over financial reporting associated with cliniqa and zephyrus 

  

based on our assessment and those criteria management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june 30 2016 due to the material weaknesses described as follows 

  

the company did not maintain an effective control environment and effective risk assessment information and communication and monitoring processes specifically the company did not have 

  

   

as a consequence the company did not have effective control activities over the establishment of general information technology controls gitcs for certain of its it platforms specifically program change controls and user access due to the impact of these ineffective gitcs automated controls and manual controls that rely on data produced by and maintained within these it system applications including the general ledger were also ineffective therefore the company failed to maintain effective controls that were fully responsive to risks over the completeness and accuracy of data used in the financial reporting process potentially impacting all financial statement accounts 

  

 

 

  

although no material misstatements were identified in our consolidated financial statements these control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis we have concluded that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june 30 2016 

  

the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2016 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public company accounting firm kpmg llp’s report contains an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting which is included in item 8 in this form 10k 

  

   

the company is in the process of improving its procedures relating to the completeness and accuracy of system generated reports utilized in the financial reporting process on july 1 2016 management implemented a new erp system at its minneapolis location with the implementation of the new erp system management expects to transition to a more automated control environment with reduced dependency on manual controls with this increased focus on automated application controls management will also ensure it has established and maintained effective gitcs 

  

the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable remedial controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded through testing that these controls are operating effectively we believe this remediation will occur in fiscal 2017 and will strengthen our internal control over financial reporting and will prevent a reoccurrence of the material weaknesses described above 

  

   

there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the company’s most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting

overview 

  

biotechne and its subsidiaries collectively doing business as biotechne biotechne we our us or the company develop manufacture and sell biotechnology reagents instruments and clinical diagnostic products worldwide with our deep product portfolio and application expertise biotechne is a leader in providing specialized proteins including cytokines and growth factors antibodies related immunoassays biologically active small molecules and other reagents to the research diagnostics and clinical controls markets with recent acquisitions we also support our customers with instrumentation designed to simplify key protein analysis processes 

  

a minneapolis minnesotabased company biotechne originally was founded as research and diagnostic systems inc rd systems in 1976 techne corporation a public entity at the time acquired rd systems in 1985 and through this action made rd systems a public company the initial products focused on the hematology blood controls and calibrators market but soon expanded through the creation of the biotechnology division to include reagents used in life science research we further expanded the product portfolio through a series of acquisitions including the amgen inc research business in 1991 the genzyme corporation research business in 1998 fortron bio science inc and biospacific inc biospacific in 2005 and boston biochem inc and tocris holdings limited tocris in 2011 in fiscal 2014 we strengthened our clinical controls solutions by acquiring bionostics holdings limited bionostics we also increased our biotechnology segment offerings through the acquisition of shanghaibased primegene biotech co primegene and novus biologicals llc novus biologicals in 2014 also in 2014 we acquired proteinsimple and cyvek inc both with innovative instrument platforms useful for protein analysis and which together form our new protein platforms segment following the 2015 fiscal year in july 2015 we acquired cliniqa corporation which specializes in the manufacturing and commercialization of quality controls and calibrators as well as bulk reagents used in the clinical diagnostic market to further expand and complement our clinical controls solutions with these recent investments we are able to scale our business and expand our product portfilio as well as geographic markets 

  

recognizing the importance of a unified and global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our strategies in fiscal 2014 we implemented a new global brand biotechne in november 2014 we also changed the name of the parent corporation from techne corporation to biotechne corporation the biotechne name is derived from the greek words “bio” or “life” and “techne” or “the application of knowledge to practical matters” the combination of these words and their meanings capture the essence of biotechne its products and mission the biotechne name solidifies the new strategic direction for the company and also unifies all of our brands under one complete portfolio 

  

we operate globally with offices in multiple locations in the united states europe and china today our product line extends to over 275000 products with state of the art facilities to accommodate many of our manufacturing needs 

  

we are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative highquality scientific tools to better understand biological processes and drive discovery we intend to build on biotechne’s past accomplishments high quality reputation and sound financial position by executing strategies that position us to become the standard for biological content in the research market and to leverage that leadership position to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets our strategies include 

  

   

   

 

 

  

    

   

  

our products and markets 

  

currently biotechne operates worldwide and has three reportable business segments the biotechnology clinical controls and protein platforms divisions the biotechnology reporting segment develops manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide the clinical controls reporting segment develops and manufactures controls and calibrators for the global clinical market and the protein platforms reporting segment develops and commercializes proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis in fiscal 2015 net sales from biotechne’s biotechnology clinical controls and protein platforms segments represented 721 133 and 146 of consolidated net sales respectively financial information relating to biotechne’s segments is incorporated herein by reference to note l to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

  

biotechnology segment 

  

through our biotechnology segment we are one of the world’s leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines growth factors immunoassays antibodies and related reagents to the biotechnology research community we isolate and produce proteins in a pure form either from the native cells or through recombinant dna technology with the acquisition of tocris in april 2011 we added chemicallybased products to our biotechnology segment our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides new tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge which may lead to a fuller understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies 

  

  

biotechnology segment products 

  

proteins we develop and manufacture inhouse a range of cytokines growth factors and enzymes extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology we produce and characterize all protein products to a high degree of purity and biological activity the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that tiny amounts of a cytokine can have on cell’s and tissues cytokines are intercellular messengers and as a result act as signaling agents by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell behavior enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins and in turn affect cell behavior and function additionally both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases and conditions including cancer alzheimer’s arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation aids and influenza 

  

antibodies antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that recognize and bind to target molecules we produce our polyclonal antibodies in animals primarily goats sheep and rabbits purifying them from the animals’ blood we derive monoclonal antibodies from immortalized rodent cell lines using hybridoma technology isolating them from cell culture medium or we manufacture them through recombinant dna technology the flow cytometry product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits that are used to determine the immunophenotypic properties of cells from different tissues 

  

 

 

  

immunoassays we market a variety of immunoassays on different testing platforms including microtiterplate based kits sold under the trade name quantikine® multiplex immunoassays based on encoded bead technology and immunoassays based on planar spotted surfaces researchers use these immunoassay products to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine protein quantification is an integral component of basic research as potential diagnostic tools for various diseases and as a valuable indicator of the effects of new therapeutic compounds in the drug discovery process immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin  b 2m immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices 

  

small molecule chemicallybased products these products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists antagonists andor inhibitors of various biological functions used in concert with other company products they provide additional tools to elucidate key pathways of cellular functions and can provide insight into the drug discovery process 

  

biotechnology segment customers and distribution methods 

  

we sell our biotechnology products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america western europe and china we have a sales and marketing partnership agreement with fisher scientific in order to bolster our market presence in north america and leverage the transactional efficiencies offered by the large fisher organization we also sell through third party distributors in china japan southern europe and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of biotechnology’s net sales during fiscal 2015 2014 or 2013 

  

biotechnology segment competitors 

  

a number of companies supply the worldwide market for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc peprotech inc santa cruz biotechnology inc abcam plc thermo fisher scientific inc cayman chemical company and enzo biochem inc market success is primarily dependent upon product quality selection and reputation we believe we are one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research market we further believe that the expanding line of our products their recognized quality and the growing demand for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market 

  

biotechnology segment manufacturing 

  

we develop and manufacture the majority of our cytokines using recombinant dna technology thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources tocris chemicalbased products are synthesized from widely available products we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products 

  

the majority of our biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders consequently we had no significant backlog of orders for our biotechnology segment products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2014 

  

clinical controls segment 

  

proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patient’s blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments our clinical controls segment develops and manufactures controls and calibrators for instruments in the global clinical market 

  

clinical controls segment products 

  

we derive our hematology controls and calibrators from various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized these control and calibrator products ensure that hematology instruments are performing accurately and reliably 

  

 

 

  

we offer a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters we also supply hematology control products for use as proficiency testing tools by laboratory certifying authorities in a number of states and countries we believe our products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of our competitors we also offer clinical controls for blood glucose and blood gas devices as well as coagulation device control products 

  

clinical controls segment customers and distribution methods 

  

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for our clinical controls products in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 oem agreements accounted for 411 million 412 million and 108 million respectively or 9 12 and 3 of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year respectively the increase in fiscal 2014 was a result of the acquisition of bionostics we sell our clinical control products directly to customers in the united states and primarily through distributors in the rest of the world one oem customer accounted for approximately 13 and 14 of clinical controls’ net sales during fiscal 2015 and 2014 respectively no single customer accounted for more than 10 of clinical controls’ net sales in fiscal 2013 

  

clinical controls segment competitors 

  

competition is intense in the clinical controls business the market is composed of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products and independent blood control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers the principal clinical diagnostic control competitors for our products in this segment are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc streck inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation we believe we are the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc we compete based primarily on product performance quality and price 

  

clinical controls segment manufacturing 

  

the primary raw material for our clinical controls products is whole blood we purchase human blood from commercial blood banks and porcine and bovine blood from nearby meat processing plants after we receive raw blood we separate it into its cellular components and then process and stabilize it although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business biotechne does not perform its own pathogen testing as most suppliers test all human blood collected 

  

the majority of the clinical control products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule there was no significant backlog of orders for our clinical control products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2014 

  

protein platforms segment 

  

proteins are important for understanding disease because they are the functional units that carry out specific tasks in every cell without them the cell cannot perform its intended function produce the energy it requires maintain its shape or survive in its environment however proteins are difficult to interrogate because they are large complex and unique our protein platforms segment develops manufactures and sells tools to make protein analysis simpler more quantitative and reproduceable 

  

protein platforms segment products 

  

the simple western platform the western blot or western is one of the most widelyused assay for protein analysis and identification today unchanged since its invention in 1979 the western assay is used by molecular biologists biochemists and clinicians to determine if a specific protein is present in a sample this assay is an immunoassay meaning that it requires a specific antibody in order to correctly identify the protein of interest the western blot also shows the researcher the size of the protein identified our simple western platform is a fullyautomated analytical technique that can identify and quantify a protein of interest in a sample like the western blot our simple western also provides the user with the size of the protein and utilizes antibodies to identify specific proteins in the sample the simple western automates the entire workflow and transforms the western blot into a gelfree blotfree assay requiring just 30 minutes of sample prep time not only does the simple western simplify the workflow it transforms the western into a real analytical tool for protein analysis providing truly quantitative high quality data the reproducibility of the assay enables researchers to determine quantitatively how much protein exists in a given sample as has been demonstrated in numerous experiments conducted by us and our customers each of our simple western products is more sensitive than a traditional western meaning that the simple western will detect a lower level of target protein in a given sample or allow a researcher to use less sample to run the assay multiple proteins can also be assessed in every sample allowing a more holistic view of protein function 

  

 

 

  

simpleplex platform a common assay used in research and clinical diagnostics is the elisa or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay elisa tests detect a variety proteins including cytokines hormones bacterial antigens and antibodies elisa tests can be cumbersome and timeconsuming and are not always easy to replicate especially when attempting to test several proteins in a single assay the simpleplex platform is a transformative immunoassay technology which integrates an innovatively designed microfluidic cartridge with a stateoftheart analyzer to deliver a benchtop immunoassay system that is more sensitive than elisa with none of the traditional challenges of assay design or repeatability simpleplex assays are fully automated multianalyte immunoassays that permit the customer to run multiple samples while interrogating multiple analytes in approximately one hour we believe the simpleplex technology along with other immunoassay platforms offered by biotechne represents the most comprehensive line of immunoassay products to meet customers’ complete workflow in their research and clinical protein applications 

  

biologics instrumentation biologics are complex proteinbased therapeutics and are transforming the pharmaceutical industry and treatment of many diseases biologic drugs are very effective targeted therapeutics for diseases such as arthritis cancer and diabetes and their number in development is increasing because of a variety of advances in biochemistry immunology and biotechnology biologics can be monoclonal antibodies recombinant proteins and vaccines developers of biologics are required by regulatory agencies such as fda to develop robust processes to ensure that the specific biologic of interest can be identified and characterized accurately and then consistently and reliably produced as a result a suite of complementary analytical approaches are utilized to measure attributes such as identity biological potency purity safety and impurities these analytical approaches are used throughout the product development process spanning initial discovery expression formulation process development quality control and final release our biologics tools help researchers interrogate protein purity and identify contaminants during the development and production of biologics our ice3 system is an analytical tool that measures the charge heterogeneity of proteins our microflow imaging or mfi platform detects both visible 10 µm and larger and subvisible below 10 µm particles it directly measures the size shape count and concentration of particles within the 1 µm to 300 µm size range 

  

protein platforms segment customers and distribution methods 

  

we sell our protein platforms products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america western europe and japan we also sell through third party distributors in china southern europe and the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of protein platforms’ net sales during fiscal 2015 2014 or 2013 

  

protein platforms segment competitors 

  

our simple western platform is a complete replacement for the traditional western blot as a result we face competition from the vendors that supply instruments and reagents to traditional western blot users these competitors include biorad laboratories ge healthcare merck kgaa perkinelmer and thermo fisher scientific all of these vendors provide elements of the traditional work flow similarly our simpleplex platform replaces the traditional elisa assay as well as some flowbased multiplex assays competitors include those who supply instruments and reagents for elisas including meso scale discovery perkinelmer thermo fisher luminex millipore molecular devices tecan biotek and biorad laboratories the primary competitors for our biologics instrumentation are agilent technologies danaher and perkinelmer as well as ge healthcare shimadzu thermo fisher and waters we believe our competitive position is strong due to the unique aspects of our products and our product quality 

  

protein platforms segment manufacturing 

  

we manufacture our simple western products at our facility in san jose california and minneapolis minnesota our biologics instruments and consumables are manufactured at our facilities in toronto and ottawa both located in ontario canada we manufacture our simple plex products at our facility in wallingford connecticut we manufacture our own components where we believe it adds significant value but we rely on suppliers for the manufacture of some of the consumables components subassemblies and autosamplers used with or included in our systems which are manufactured to our specifications we are not dependent on any one supplier and are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to assure ourselves of a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers we conduct all final testing and inspection of our products we have established a quality control program including a set of standard manufacturing and documentation procedures 

  

 

 

  

there was no significant backlog of orders for our protein platforms products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2014

prior investments 

  

biotechne has an approximate 14 equity investment in chemocentryx inc ccxi ccxi is a technology and drug development company working in the area of chemokines chemokines are cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of leukocytes the effector cells of the human immune system biotechne’s investment in ccxi is included in “shortterm availableforsale investments” at june 30 2015 and 2014 at fair values of 523 million and 371 million respectively 

  

  

government regulation 

  

all manufacturers of clinical diagnostic controls are regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended all of biotechne’s clinical control products are classified as  in vitro diagnostic products by the us food and drug administration fda the entire control manufacturing process from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their expiration date is strictly regulated and documented fda inspectors make periodic site inspections of biotechne’s clinical control operations and facilities clinical control manufacturing must comply with quality system regulations qsr as set forth in the fda’s regulations governing medical devices 

  

three of biotechne’s immunoassay kits epo tfr and b 2m have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use biotechne must comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits biotechnology products manufactured in the us and sold for use in the research market do not require fda clearance tocris products are used as research tools and require no regulatory approval for commercialization however some of tocris’ products are considered controlled substances and require government permits to stock such products and to ship them to endusers biotechne has no reason to believe that these annual permits will not be reissued 

  

some of biotechne’s research groups use small amounts of radioactive materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development activities thus biotechne is subject to regulation and inspection by the minnesota department of health and has been granted a license through august 2016 biotechne has had no difficulties in renewing this license in prior years and has no reason to believe it will not be renewed in the future if however the license was not renewed it would have minimal effect on biotechne’s business since there are other technologies the research groups could use to replace the use of radioisotopes 

  

biotechne is subject to the medical device excise tax which was included as part of the affordable care act the tax applies to the sale of medical devices by a manufacturer producer or importer of the device and is 23 of the sale price the tax applies to biotechne’s in vitro diagnostic products including its clinical control products and biotechnology clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits biotechne’s medical device excise tax for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 06 million and 05 million respectively 

  

  

patents and trademarks 

  

our success depends at least in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property to accomplish this we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights including patents trade secrets and trademarks as well as customary contractual protections as of june 30 2015 we had rights to 45 granted patents and approximately 50 pending patent applications primarily relating to our clinical controls products paten protection if granted generally has a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant we cannot assure you whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the grant of a patent whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims and whether our claims will provide adequate coverage of our competitors’ products or services biotechne is not substantially dependent on products for which it has obtained patent protection 

  

 

 

  

in addition to pursuing patents on our products we also preserve much of our innovation as trade secrets we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees consultants corporate partners and when needed our advisors such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure monitoring unauthorized disclosure is difficult and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure are or will be adequate 

  

no assurance can be given that biotechne’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others particularly for genetically engineered products biotechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products where we have been contacted by patent holders with certain intellectual property rights biotechne has entered into licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive andor nonexclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented proteins and related products to the research market for fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 40 million 35 million and 33 million respectively 

  

biotechne has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its brand and product names biotechne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered 

  

  

seasonality of business 

  

biotechnology and protein platforms segment products marketed by biotechne historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months biotechne also usually experiences a slowing of sales in all of its reportable segments during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period biotechne believes this seasonality is a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base 

  

  

employees 

  

through its subsidiaries biotechne employed approximately 1356 fulltime and parttime employees as of june 30 2015 

  

environment 

  

compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws in the united states united kingdom germany china and hong kong had no material effect on biotechne in fiscal 2015

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the company’s business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the company’s other sec filings could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

  

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings 

  

the company’s biotechnology and protein platforms products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by the company’s customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the us and global economies recently experienced a period of economic downturn and have been slow to recover such downturns and other reductions or delays in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the company’s products the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 

  

the biotechnology and clinical control industries are very competitive more so recently due to consolidation trends 

  

the company faces significant competition across all of its product lines and in each market in which it operates competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’ actions may impact the company’s future sales and earnings 

  

the company’s future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 

  

one element of the company’s growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases as a result the company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs new product development requires planning designing and testing at both technological and manufacturingprocess levels and may require significant research and development expenditures there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that the company may seek to develop in the future will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance there can also be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products in a more timely and cost effective manner than the company if the company does not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies the company’s technologies will become outdated rendering the company’s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive to the extent the company fails to introduce new and innovative products the company may lose market share to its competitors which may be difficult or impossible to regain 

  

 

 

  

acquisitions and divestures pose financial management and other risks and challenges 

  

the company routinely explores acquiring other businesses and assets from time to time the company may also consider disposing of certain assets subsidiaries or lines of business during fiscal 2015 the company acquired novus proteinsimple and cyvek in july 2016 we acquired cliniqa corporation acquisitions or divestitures present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention difficulty with integrating acquired businesses integration of different corporate cultures or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities there can be no assurance that the company will engage in any additional acquisitions or divestitures or that the company will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits in addition acquisitions financed with borrowings could make the company more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect the company’s earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense 

  

the company is subject to risk associated with global operations 

  

the company engages in business globally with approximately 46 of the company’s sales revenue in fiscal 2015 coming from outside the us this subjects the company to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond the company’s control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases 

  

the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in the company’s business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibited business conduct and damage to the company’s reputation the company incurs additional legal compliance costs associated with its global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if it does not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us 

  

the company conducts and plans to grow its business in developing markets which may cause additional operational and legal risk 

  

the company’s efforts to grow its businesses depends to a degree on its success in developing market share in additional geographic markets including but not limited to china in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than the company’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements 

  

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although the company implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of the company’s employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which the company outsources certain aspects of its business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with the company’s internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by the company’s internal policies could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and result in significant fines or penalties 

  

 

 

  

the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates and changes to the strength of foreign governments and economic conditions 

  

approximately 24 of the company’s net sales in fiscal 2015 were made through its foreign subsidiaries which transact their sales in foreign currencies any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could therefore negatively affect the company’s revenues and earnings in fiscal 2015 for example the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar changed materially resulting in consolidated net sales that were approximately 85 million lower in fiscal 2015 when compared to fiscal 2014 moreover the financial crisis faced by several eurozone countries and the ongoing economic instability in that region may lead to reduced spending on health care and research by eurozone governments which could adversely affect the company’s european sales as well as its revenues financial condition and results of operations 

  

the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in chemocentryx inc and other companies in which it does not have a majority interest the success of which is largely out of the company’s control 

  

the company’s expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company’s business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected 

  

the company has an approximate 14 equity investment in chemocentryx inc ccxi that is valued at 523 million on the company’s june 30 2015 consolidated balance sheet ccxi is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and commercializing orallyadministered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and cancers the development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking ccxi is dependent on a limited number of products must achieve favorable clinical trial results obtain regulatory and marketing approval for these products ccxi has also incurred significant losses and has yet to achieve profitability 

  

the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares these factors make it possible that the company could experience future dilution or a decline in the 228 million unrealized gain it has on its ccxi investment andor its original 295 million investment in ccxi at august 26 2015 the market value of the company’s investment in ccxi was approximately 44 million 

  

the company’s success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

  

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production sales and marketing and management personnel are critical to the company’s success the company’s anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the company’s business 

  

the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights 

  

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to protect and maintain its intellectual property including trade secrets if we fail to protect our intellectual property third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us we may lose our technological or competitive advantage or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property the company attempts to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements but those agreements can be breached and if they are there may not be an adequate remedy if trade secrets become publicly known the company could lose its competitive position 

  

the company also attempts to protect and maintain intellectual property through the patent process as of june 30 2015 we owned or exclusively licensed 45 granted us patents and approximately 50 pending patent applications we cannot be confident that any of our currently pending or future patent applications will result in granted patents and we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to be granted it is possible that if patents are granted to us others will design around our patented technologies further other parties may challenge any patents granted to us and courts or regulatory agencies may hold our patents to be invalid or unenforceable we may not be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications any successful thirdparty challenge to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors may be diminished because of these uncertainties to the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection or is found to be invalid or unenforceable we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct competition if our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors’ products our competitive position could be adversely affected as could our business both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 

  

 

 

  

we may be involved in lawsuits to determine the scope coverage and validity of others’ proprietary rights or to defend against thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement any of which could be timeintensive and costly and may adversely impact our business 

  

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate the company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties 

  

the company has been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that the company is infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus from other business concerns if the company is found to be infringing the intellectual property of others it could be required to cease certain activities alter its products or processes or pay licensing fees this would cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company if the company is unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent it may be unable to sell some of its products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if the company does not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect the company’s earnings 

  

the company has entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect the company make it more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent it from funding its expansion strategy 

  

in connection with the acquisition of proteinsimple in july 2014 the company entered into a revolving credit facility governed by a credit agreement dated july 28 2014 the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of 150 million which can be increased by an additional 150 million subject to certain conditions borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of july 31 2015 the company had drawn 73 million under the credit agreement 

  

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as 

  

   

   

   

the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions 

  

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends 

  

 

 

  

we may experience difficulties implementing our enterprise resource planning system 

  

we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system our erp system is critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records record transactions provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements the implementation of the new erp system requires the investment of significant financial and human resources in addition we may not be able to successfully complete the implementation of the new erp system without experiencing difficulties any disruptions delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new erp system could adversely affect our ability to process orders ship products provide services and customer support send invoices and track payments fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business 

  

the company’s business is subject to governmental laws and regulations 

  

the company’s operations are subject to regulation by various us federal state and international agencies laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the company’s operations including design development manufacturing labeling selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the company’s operations and ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of the company’s products if the company fails to comply with any of these regulations it may become subject to fines penalties or actions that could impact development manufacturing and distribution andor increase costs or reduce sales the approval process applicable to clinical control products and certain immunoassay kits that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the company’s revenues 

  

as a multinational corporation the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of us federal state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions from time to time new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments 

  

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products 

  

the company’s internal quality control packaging and distribution operations support the majority of the company’s sales since certain company products must comply with food and drug administration quality system regulations and because in all instances the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason particularly at the minneapolis facility could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the company’s future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions 

  

the design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls litigation or alerts relating to the company’s products a recall could result in significant costs and damage to the company’s reputation which could reduce demand particularly for certain of its regulated products 

  

disruptions in the supply and cost of raw materials could reduce the company’s earnings cash flow and ability to meet customers’ needs 

  

the company’s products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however some of the company’s products are available only from a single supplier if such suppliers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to supply these materials for any reason such failures could have a material adverse impact on the company’s product sales and business in addition price increases for raw materials could adversely affect the company’s earnings and cash flow 

  

 

 

  

increased exposure to product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

  

product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products offered by the company’s customers currently these risks are primarily borne by the company’s customers as the company’s products and services are further integrated into customers’ production processes the company may become increasingly exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of its products or services is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects there can be no assurance that a future product liability claim or series of claims brought against the company would not have an adverse effect on the company’s business or the results of operations the company’s business may be materially and adversely affected by a successful product liability claim or claims in excess of any insurance coverage that it may have in addition product liability claims regardless of their merits could be costly divert management’s attention and adversely affect the company’s reputation and demand for its products 

  

any such product liability claims brought against the company could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of the company’s insurance coverage although the company carries product liability insurance it cannot be certain that current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

  

cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s computer hardware software and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to the company’s reputation andor subject the company to costs fines or lawsuits 

  

the integrity and protection of the company’s own data and that of its customers and employees is critical to the company’s business the regulatory environment governing information security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase the company’s operating costs andor adversely impact the company’s ability to market its products and services to customers although the company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards it is still vulnerable to fire storm flood power loss earthquakes telecommunications failures physical or software breakins software viruses and similar events these events could lead to the unauthorized access disclosure and use of nonpublic information the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world as a result the company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures if the company’s computer systems are compromised it could be subject to fines damages litigation and enforcement actions customers could curtail or cease using its applications and the company could lose trade secrets the occurrence of which could harm its business 

  

we are now subject to regulations related to “conflict minerals” which may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products 

  

with our acquisitions of proteinsimple and cyvek in 2014 we now manufacture and sell products that may be covered under the securities and exchange commission’s sec rule regarding “conflict minerals” we are now required to determine whether these products contain conflict minerals and if so to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc or an adjoining country under the regulations we are required to file a report with the sec by may 31 2017 to disclose and report whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the drc or an adjoining country complying with this regulation could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products including tantalum tin gold and tungsten the number of suppliers who provide conflictfree minerals may be limited in addition there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products as well as costs of possible changes to products processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement which may harm our reputation in addition we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflictfree which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so

overall results 

  

for fiscal 2015 consolidated net sales increased 26 as compared to fiscal 2014 after adjusting for the impact of the novus proteinsimple and cyvek acquisitions in fiscal 2015 as well as foreign currency fluctuations organic sales for the year increased 4 with currency translation having a negative impact of 2 and acquisitions contributing 25 to the revenue growth the organic growth was broadbased with the company achieving growth in both the biotechnology and clinical controls reporting segments a strong biopharma endmarket in the us and significant government funding of life science research in china were the biggest contributing factors impacting organic growth 

  

consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 3 for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 after adjusting for acquisition related costs and certain income tax items in both years adjusted net earnings increased 1 in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 adjusted earnings growth was driven by increased organic sales and contribution from acquisitions partially offset by a negative impact from foreign currency translation 

  

for fiscal 2014 consolidated net sales increased 15 as compared to fiscal 2013 after adjusting for the 11 impact of the bionostics and primegene acquisitions in fiscal 2014 as well as 2 positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations organic sales for the year increased 3 the growth was broadbased with the company achieving organic growth in both the biotechnology and clinical controls reporting segments and in most regions of the world commercial investments made globally in fiscal 2014 especially in china were the biggest contributing factor impacting organic revenue growth 

  

consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 1 for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 after adjusting for acquisition related costs and certain income tax items in both years adjusted net earnings increased 6 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings growth was driven by increased sales partially offset by a lower margin mix from the acquired bionostics business as well as investments made in commercial operations and administrative infrastructure during fiscal 2014 

  

 

 

  

results of operations 

  

net s ales 

  

consolidated organic net sales exclude the impact of net sales contributed by companies acquired during the fiscal year and the effect of the change from the prior year in exchange rates used to convert sales in foreign currencies primarily british pound sterling euros and chinese yuan into us dollars 

  

consolidated net sales growth was as follows 

 

   

  

consolidated net sales by reportable segment were as follows in thousands   

 

   

in fiscal 2015 biotechnology segment net sales increased 8 from the prior fiscal year included in fiscal 2015 biotechnology segment net sales was 185 million generated by the acquisition of novus biologicals in july 2014 and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 85 million excluding these amounts organic net sales for the segment increased 3 in fiscal 2015 driven by a strong biopharma endmarket in the us and significant government funding of life science research in china the academia and government endmarket in the us continued to improve sequentially each quarter in 2015 which the company capitalized on through its distribution partnership with fisher scientific in europe most countries experienced growth in 2015 but this growth was negated by the timing of research cycles experienced by the company’s large pharma customers located in germany the pacific rim regions delivered modest growth with the exception of japan where the devaluation of the yen versus the us dollar encouraged local distributors to hold lower levels of inventory than in the prior year 

  

in fiscal 2015 clinical controls segment net sales increased 6 with organic sales contributing 5 to growth and the acquisition of bionostics contributing 1 to growth growth came equally from solid demand for both the segment’s hematologybased controls and blood glucosegasbased controls attributable to close relationships with our oem customers 

  

in fiscal 2015 the new protein platforms segment generated net sales of 662 million this segment includes the proteinsimple product lines associated with the acquisitions of proteinsimple in july 2014 and cyvek in november 2014 both of which expand the company’s solutions that it can offer its customers by developing and commercializing proprietary systems and consumables for protein analysis 

  

in fiscal 2014 biotechnology segment net sales increased 4 from the prior fiscal year included in fiscal 2014 biotechnology segment net sales was 07 million from the acquisition of primegene in april 2014 and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 35 million excluding these amounts organic net sales for the segment increased 3 in fiscal 2014 driven by the commercial investments made in china solid execution from our pacific rim distributors and a robust pharma and biotech market in the us us academic customers still suffered from decreases in nih funding but sales to these customers stabilized sequentially throughout fiscal 2014 included in fiscal 2014 net sales were 34 million of sales of new biotechnology products released during the fiscal year 

  

in fiscal 2014 clinical controls segment net sales increased 348 million or 61 from the prior fiscal year included in clinical controls segment net sales was 331 million from the acquisition of bionostics in july 2013 clinical controls segment organic net sales increased 7 in fiscal 2014 from each of the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of strong endmarket demand and operational execution 

  

 

 

  

gross margins 

  

consolidated gross margins were 68 70 and 74 in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively gaap reported consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2015 2014 2013 and prior years under purchase accounting inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles adjusted gross margins were 72 74 and 77 in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

  

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales is as follows 

  

   

fluctuations in adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net sales have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix in fiscal 2015 the biggest impact to gross margin as compared to fiscal 2014 was the change in product mix associated with the acquisitions of novus proteinsimple and cyvek in fiscal 2014 the biggest impact to gross margin as compared to fiscal 2013 was the change in product mix associated with the acquisition of bionostics we expect that in the future gross margins will continue to be impacted by future acquisitions as well as by the introduction and growth of lowerpriced brands that will differentiate from our current premium brands and allow the company to better compete in more pricesensitive markets 

  

segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were as follows

critical accounting policies 

  

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

  

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies investors should also refer to note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k  

  

valuation of a vailable f or s ale i nvestments 

  

the company considers all of its marketable securities availableforsale and reports them at fair market value fair market values are based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments are excluded from income but are included net of taxes in other comprehensive income if an “otherthantemporary” impairment is determined to exist the difference between the value of the investment recorded in the financial statements and the company’s current estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined net unrealized gains on availableforsale investments at june 30 2015 were 143 million 

  

valuation of i nventory 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market the company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slowmoving and obsolete inventory inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration 

  

to meet strict customer quality standards the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins antibodies and its chemicallybased products these products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met in addition the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale the manufacturing process for these products therefore has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a twoyear forecast and its chemicallybased products on a fiveyear forecast the establishment of a twoyear or fiveyear forecast requires considerable judgment inventory quantities in excess of the forecast are not valued due to uncertainty over salability the value of protein antibody and chemicallybased product inventory not valued at june 30 2015 was 24 million 

  

the fair value of inventory purchased through acquisitions was determined based on quantities acquired selling prices at the date of acquisition and management’s assumptions regarding inventory having future value and the costs to sell such inventories inventory purchased in fiscal 2015 through the acquisitions of novus proteinsimple and cyvek was increased 41 million 14 million and 01 million respectively the increase in value of the fiscal 2015 acquired inventory remaining at june 30 2015 was 23 million for novus substantially all of proteinsimple and cyvek acquired inventory was sold as of june 30 2015 

  

 

 

  

inventory purchased in fiscal 2014 through the acquisition of bionostics and primegene was increased 17 million to 57 million and 08 million to 10 million respectively substantially all of bionostics and primegene acquired inventory was sold as of june 30 2015 

  

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 

  

when a business is acquired the purchase price is allocated as applicable between tangible assets identifiable intangible assets and goodwill determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets requires significant estimates the fair value of intangible assets acquired including developed technologies trade names customer relationships and noncompete agreements were based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows using a relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings method with consideration to other factors including an independent valuation of management’s assumptions intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 20 years the company reviews the carrying amount of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 293 million at june 30 2015 

  

goodwill recognized in connection with a business acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units the company’s annual assessment included a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value a significant change in the company’s market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed as of june 30 2015 as the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values goodwill at june 30 2015 was 391 million 

  

valuation of i nvestments 

  

the company has made equity investments in several startup and early development stage companies including cyvek in fiscal 2014 the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity method is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to the company’s share in the equity of the investee and the company’s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee in determining which accounting treatment to apply the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment 

  

the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor fda clearance to market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment 

  

 

 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures 

about market risk 

  

at the end of fiscal 2015 the company had a portfolio of equity securities excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents of 564 million see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k as the company’s securities are classified as availableforsale unrealized gains or losses are recognized by the company in “other comprehensive income loss” on the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income 

  

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 18 of the company’s consolidated net sales in fiscal 2015 were made in foreign currencies including 6 in euro 4 in british pound sterling 5 in chinese yuan and the remaining 3 in other european and asian currencies as a result the company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling and the chinese yuan as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company’s foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation in fiscal 2015 for example the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar changed materially resulting in consolidated net sales that were approximately 85 million lower in fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

  

monthend exchange rates between the british pound sterling euro and chinese yuan and the us dollar which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods were as follows 

  

   

the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements but receivable or payable in another currency at june 30 2015 the company had the following trade receivable and intercompany payables denominated in one currency but receivable or payable in another currency in thousands 

  

   

all of the above balances are revolving in nature and are not deemed to be longterm balances 

  

the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in “other nonoperating expense net” in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of “accumulated other comprehensive income loss”

overview 

techne and its subsidiaries collectively doing business as biotechne biotechne we our us or the company develop manufacture and sell biotechnology products and clinical diagnostic controls worldwide with our deep product portfolio and application expertise biotechne is a leader in providing specialized proteins including cytokines and growth factors and related immunoassays small molecules and other reagents to the research diagnostics and clinical controls markets 

a minneapolis minnesotabased company biotechne originally was founded as research and diagnostic systems inc rd systems in 1976 initially producing hematology controls and calibrators for primary use in clinical settings techne corporation a public entity at the time and currently the parent company acquired rd systems in 1984 and through this action made rd systems a public company the initial products focused on the hematology blood controls and calibrators market but soon expanded through the creation of the biotechnology division to include reagents used in life science research a series of acquisitions further expanded the product portfolio these included the amgen research business in 1991 the genzyme research business in 1997 fortron bio science inc and biospacific inc biospacific in 2005 and boston biochem inc and tocris holdings limited tocris in 2011 in fiscal 2014 we further strengthened our clinical controls solutions by acquiring bionostics holdings limited bionostics and our biotechnology segment offerings were increased by the recent acquisition of shanghai primegene biotech co primegene and an agreement to invest in and possibly acquire cyvek inc cyvek with these recent investments we will be able to scale our business and expand into new product and geographic markets 

recognizing the importance of a unified and global approach to meeting our mission and accomplishing our strategies in fiscal 2014 we implemented a new global brand biotechne the biotechne brand is derived from the greek words “bio” or “life” and “techne” or “the application of knowledge to practical matters” the combination of these words and their meanings capture the essence of biotechne its products and mission the acquisition of various brands over the years drove the need for an umbrella branding strategy that could hold all of the acquired assets the biotechne name solidifies the new strategic direction for the company along with unifying and positioning all of our brands under one complete portfolio 

with these strategic efforts as well as the establishment of dedicated subsidiaries in europe and asia we now operate globally along with offices in several locations in the united states europe and china today our product line extends to over 24000 products 95 of which are manufactured inhouse while maintaining our core strengths in cytokines and immunoassays we also develop antibodies cell selection and multicolor flow cytometry kits multiplex assays biologically active compounds and stem cell products and kits 

we are committed to providing the life sciences community with innovative highquality scientific tools to better understand biological processes and drive discovery we intend to build on biotechne’s past accomplishments strong reputation and financial position by executing strategies that position us to become the standard for biological content in the research market and to leverage that leadership position to enter the diagnostics and other adjacent markets our strategies include 

 

  

  

   

  

 our products and markets 

currently biotechne operates worldwide and has two reportable business segments biotechnology and clinical controls both of which serve the life science and diagnostic markets the biotechnology reporting segment develops manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide the clinical controls reporting segment develops and manufactures controls and calibrators for the global clinical market in fiscal 2014 net sales from biotechne’s biotechnology segment were 84 of consolidated net sales biotechne’s clinical controls segment net sales were 16 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2014 financial information relating to biotechne’s segments is incorporated herein by reference to note l to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

biotechnology segment 

through our biotechnology segment we are one of the world’s leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines growth factors immunoassays antibodies and related reagents to the biotechnology research community the proteins are produced naturally in minute amounts by different cell types and can be isolated in a pure form either from the same cells or produced through recombinant dna technology with the acquisition of tocris in april 2011 we added chemicallybased products to our biotechnology segment these small compounds sold in highly purified forms typically with agonistic or antagonistic properties in a variety of biological processes allow customers access to a broad range of compounds and biological reagents to meet their life science research needs our combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provides new tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge which may lead to a fuller understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies 

currently the majority of the protein products are produced by laboratory processes that use recombinant dna technology while our chemicallybased products are produced using available chemicals consequently raw materials are readily available for most of our products in the biotechnology segment 

biotechnology segment products 

proteins cytokines growth factors and enzymes extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are developed and manufactured in house all protein products are produced to the highest possible purity and characterized to ensure the highest level of biological activity the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that tiny amounts of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues cytokines are intercellular messengers and as a result act as signaling agents by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell behavior for example cytokines can induce cells to acquire more specialized functions and features differentiation or can play a key role in attracting cells at the site of injury inducing them to grow and initiate the healing process unregulated cytokine production and action can have nonbeneficial effects and lead to various pathologies enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts that accelerate chemical reactions most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins and in turn affect cell behavior and function additionally both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases and conditions including cancer alzheimer’s arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation aids and influenza 

  

antibodies antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that recognize and bind to target molecules biotechne’s polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats sheep and rabbits and purified from the animals’ blood monoclonal antibodies are derived from immortalized rodent cell lines using hybridoma technology and are isolated from cell culture medium the flow cytometry product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits that are used to determine the immunophenotypic properties of cells from different tissues 

immunoassays we market a variety of immunoassays on different testing platforms including a microtiterplate based kit sold under the trade name quantikine ®  multiplex immunoassays based on encoded bead technology and immunoassays based on planar spotted surfaces all of these immunoassay products are used by researchers to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine protein quantification is an integral component of basic research as potential diagnostic tools for various diseases and as a valuable indicator of the effects of new therapeutic compounds in the drug discovery process 

immunoassays can also be useful in clinical diagnostics we have received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin ß2m immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices 

small molecule chemicallybased products these products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists antagonists andor inhibitors of various biological functions used in concert with other company products they provide additional tools to elucidate key pathways of cellular functions and can provide insight into the drug discovery process 

recent acquisitions and investments made in fiscal 2014 and 2015 will further expand and complement biotechne’s current product offerings in the biotechnology segment for additional information regarding our investments and acquisitions see “acquisitions and investments” under this item 1 

biotechnology segment customers and distribution methods 

we sell our biotechnology products directly to customers who are primarily located in north america western europe and china in january 2014 we entered into a sales and marketing partnership agreement with fisher scientific in order to bolster our market presence in north america and leverage the transactional efficiencies offered by the large fisher organization we also sell through third party distributors in china southern europe and in the rest of the world our sales are widely distributed and no single enduser customer accounted for more than 10 of biotechnology’s net sales during fiscal 2014 2013 or 2012 

biotechnology segment competitors 

the worldwide market for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents is being supplied by a number of companies including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc peprotech inc santa cruz biotechnology inc abcam plc sigmaaldrich corporation thermo fisher scientific inc cayman chemical company and enzo biochem inc market success is primarily dependent upon product quality selection and reputation and we believe we are one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research market we further believe that the expanding line of our products their recognized quality and the growing demand for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents will allow us to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market 

biotechnology segment manufacturing 

our biotechnology segment develops and manufactures the majority of its cytokines using recombinant dna technology thus significantly reducing our reliance on outside resources tocris chemicalbased products are synthesized from widely available products we typically have several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products 

the majority of biotechne’s biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders consequently we had no significant backlog of orders for our biotechnology segment products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2013 

  

clinical controls segment 

proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patient’s blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments our clinical controls segment develops and manufactures controls and calibrators for instruments in the global clinical market 

clinical controls segment products 

hematology controls and calibrators are products derived from various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized control and calibrator products can be utilized to ensure that hematology instruments are performing accurately and reliably ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately in addition most instruments need to be calibrated periodically hematology calibrators are similar to controls but undergo additional testing to ensure that the calibration values assigned are within tight specifications and can be used to calibrate the instrument 

cellbased whole blood controls our clinical controls segment offers a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters hematology control products are also supplied for use as proficiency testing tools by laboratory certifying authorities in a number of states and countries we believe our products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of our competitors 

chemistrybased blood controls the acquisition of bionostics early in fiscal 2014 expanded our product offerings in the clinical controls segment through their chemistrybased blood controls controls for blood glucose and blood gas devices are the largest portion of bionostics’ business bionostics recently launched coagulation device control products which extend its product portfolio and allow it to enter an adjacent market segment in the controls business 

clinical controls segment customers and distribution methods 

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for our clinical controls products in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 oem agreements accounted for 412 million 108 million and 97 million respectively or 12 3 and 3 of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year respectively the increase in fiscal 2014 was a result of the acquisition of bionostics we sell our clinical control products directly to customers in the united states and through distributors in the rest of the world one oem customer accounted for approximately 14 of clinical controls’ net sales during fiscal 2014 no single customer accounted for more than 10 of clinical controls’ net sales in fiscal 2013 or 2012 

clinical controls segment competitors 

competition is intense in the clinical controls business the first control products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell counting historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made controls for use on their own instruments with rapid expansion of the instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled noninstrument manufacturers to gain a foothold today the market is composed of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products and independent blood control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers the principal clinical diagnostic control competitors for our products in this segment are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc streck inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation we believe we are the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc 

clinical controls segment manufacturing 

the primary raw material for our clinical controls products is whole blood human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks while porcine and bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants after raw blood is received it is separated into its components processed and stabilized although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens prior to use the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on our business biotechne does not perform its own pathogen testing as most suppliers test all human blood collected 

  

there was no significant backlog of orders for our clinical control products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2013 the majority of the clinical control products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule 

geographic information 

following is financial information relating to geographic areas in thousands 

 

  

 net sales are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer or distributor longlived assets are comprised of land buildings and improvements and equipment net of accumulated depreciation and other assets see the description of risks associated with the company’s foreign subsidiaries in item 1a of this annual report on form 10k 

products under development 

biotechne is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of our major product lines controls and calibrators and cytokines antibodies assays small bioactive molecules and related biotechnology products we believe that our future success depends to a large extent on our ability to keep pace with changing technologies and market needs 

in fiscal 2014 biotechne introduced approximately 1600 new biotechnology products to the life science market all of these products are for research use only and therefore did not require fda clearance we are planning to release new proteins antibodies immunoassay products and small molecules in the coming year we also expect to significantly expand our portfolio of products through acquisitions of existing businesses however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace 

 

   

acquisitions and investments 

fiscal 2015 acquisitions 

on july 31 2014 biotechne closed on the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of proteinsimple for approximately 300 million the purchase price may be adjusted postclosing based on the final levels of cash and working capital of proteinsimple at closing certain proteinsimple stockholders are subject to noncompete and nonsolicitation obligations for three years following the closing proteinsimple develops markets and sells westernblotting instruments biologics and reagents western blotting remains one of the most frequently practiced life science techniques and proteinsimple’s tools allow researchers to perform this basic research technique with greater speed and efficiency automation of the western blotting technique has the potential to drive additional sales of the consumables biotechne already sells especially antibodies which have been validated for western blotting applications 

on july 2 2014 biotechne announced that it had acquired all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of novus biologicals llc novus for approximately 600 million novus is a littleton coloradobased supplier of a large portfolio of both outsourced and inhouse developed antibodies and other reagents for life science research delivered through an innovative digital commerce platform the acquisition further expanded our antibody portfolio consistent with our long term strategic business plan to serve customers with a complete and quality line of reagents 

fiscal 2014 investments and acquisitions 

on july 22 2013 the company’s rd systems subsidiary acquired for approximately 103 million cash all of the outstanding shares of bionostics bionostics is a global leader in the development manufacture and distribution of control solutions that verify the proper operation of invitro diagnostic devices primarily utilized in point of care blood glucose and blood gas testing bionostics is included in biotechne’s clinical controls segment

on april 1 2014 biotechne through its whollyowned subsidiary rd systems inc entered into an agreement to invest 100 million in cyvek inc in return for shares of cyvek common stock representing approximately 199 of the outstanding voting stock of cyvek in connection with this investment rd systems became a party to cyvek’s existing investor agreements and has an observer seat on cyvek’s board of directors if within 12 months of the date of the agreement cyvek meets commercial milestones related to the sale of its cyplex analyzer products biotechne will acquire all of the remaining stock of cyvek through a merger if the merger is consummated biotechne will make an initial payment of 600 million to the other stockholders of cyvek the purchase price payable at the closing may be adjusted based on the final levels of cyvek’s net working capital we will also pay cyvek’s other stockholders up to 350 million based on the revenue generated by cyvek’s products and related products before the date that is 30 months from the closing of the merger we will also pay cyvek’s other stockholders 50 of the amount if any by which the revenue from cyvek’s products and related products exceeds 100 million in calendar year 2020 

the combination of biotechne’s reagents on cyvek’s multiplex testing platform cyplex™ will provide researchers with powerful tools to develop validate and test biomarker panels so as to expedite life sciences research and enable biomarkerbased diagnostics this strategic investment will allow us to continue to have a strong market position in the immunoassay market where multiplex testing platforms are becoming more significant 

fiscal 2013 and 2012 acquisitions 

we did not complete any material acquisitions or make any material strategic investments during fiscal 2013 and 2012 

  

prior investments 

biotechne has an approximate 14 equity investment in chemocentryx inc ccxi ccxi is a technology and drug development company working in the area of chemokines chemokines are cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of leukocytes the effector cells of the human immune system biotechne’s investment in ccxi is included in “shortterm availableforsale investments” at june 30 2014 and 2013 at fair values of 371 million and 896 million respectively 

government regulation 

all manufacturers of clinical diagnostic controls are regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended all of biotechne’s clinical control products are classified as “ in vitro diagnostic products” by the us food and drug administration fda the entire control manufacturing process from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their expiration date is strictly regulated and documented fda inspectors make periodic site inspections of biotechne’s clinical control operations and facilities clinical control manufacturing must comply with quality system regulations qsr as set forth in the fda’s regulations governing medical devices 

three of biotechne’s immunoassay kits epo tfr and ß2m have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use biotechne must comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits biotechnology products manufactured in the us and sold for use in the research market do not require fda clearance tocris products are used as research tools and require no regulatory approval for commercialization some of tocris’ products are considered controlled substances and require government permits to stock such products and to ship them to endusers biotechne has no reason to believe that these annual permits will not be reissued 

some of biotechne’s research groups use small amounts of radioactive materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development activities thus biotechne is subject to regulation and inspection by the minnesota department of health and has been granted a license through august 2016 biotechne has had no difficulties in renewing this license in prior years and has no reason to believe it will not be renewed in the future if however the license was not renewed it would have minimal effect on biotechne’s business since there are other technologies the research groups could use to replace the use of radioisotopes 

beginning on january 1 2013 biotechne is subject to the medical device excise tax which was included as part of the affordable care act the tax applies to the sale of medical devices by a manufacturer producer or importer of the device and is 23 of the sale price the tax applies to biotechne’s in vitro diagnostic products including its clinical control products and biotechnology clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits biotechne’s medical device excise tax for fiscal 2014 and 2013 was 05 million and 01 million respectively 

patents and trademarks 

biotechne owns patent protection for certain clinical controls products which generally have a life of 20 years from the date of the patent application or patent grant biotechne is not substantially dependent on products for which it has obtained patent protection 

biotechne may seek patent protection for new or existing products it manufactures no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will be obtained no assurance can be given that biotechne’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others particularly for genetically engineered products biotechne has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products 

biotechne has a number of licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the exclusive andor nonexclusive right to use patented technology as well as the right to manufacture and sell certain patented proteins and related products to the research market for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 35 million 33 million and 32 million respectively 

  

biotechne has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its brand names and clinical controls and biotechnology product groups which generally have a life of 10 years from the date of the trademark grant biotechne believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered 

seasonality of business 

biotechnology segment products marketed by biotechne historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months biotechne also usually experiences a slowing of sales in both of its reportable segments during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period biotechne believes this seasonality is a result of vacation and academic schedules of its worldwide customer base 

employees 

through its subsidiaries biotechne employed 967 fulltime and 54 parttime employees as of june 30 2014 as follows 

 

 environment 

compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws in the united states united kingdom germany china and hong kong had no material effect on biotechne in fiscal 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the company’s actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the company’s actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the company’s business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the company’s other sec filings could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings 

the company’s biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by the company’s customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate due to changes in available resources mergers of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies spending priorities general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies the us and global economies have experienced a period of economic downturn such downturns and other reductions or delays in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the company’s products the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 

the biotechnology and clinical control industries are very competitive more so recently due to consolidation trends 

the company faces significant competition across all of its product lines and in each market in which it operates competitors include companies ranging from startup companies which may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial marketing operational and research and development resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company moreover customers may believe that consolidated businesses are better able to compete as sole source vendors and therefore prefer to purchase from such businesses the entry into the market by manufacturers in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing and competitive pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’ actions may impact the company’s future sales and earnings 

the company’s future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 

one element of the company’s growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases as a result the company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs new product development requires planning designing and testing at both technological and manufacturingprocess levels and may require significant research and development expenditures there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that the company may seek to develop in the future will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance there can also be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products in a more timely and cost effective manner than the company if the company does not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies the company’s technologies will become outdated rendering the company’s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive to the extent the company fails to introduce new and innovative products the company may lose market share to its competitors which may be difficult or impossible to regain 

  

acquisitions and divestures pose financial management and other risks and challenges 

the company routinely explores acquiring other businesses and assets from time to time the company may also consider disposing of certain assets subsidiaries or lines of business in early fiscal 2014 the company finalized the acquisition of bionostics in the last quarter of fiscal 2014 the company acquired primegene and announced its investment in cyvek and its intention to acquire the remaining shares of cyvek in the event certain milestones were met subsequent to the close of fiscal 2014 the company also acquired novus and proteinsimple acquisitions or divestitures present financial managerial and operational challenges including diversion of management attention difficulty with integrating acquired businesses integration of different corporate cultures or separating personnel and financial and other systems increased expenses assumption of unknown liabilities indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers and the need to evaluate the financial systems of and establish internal controls for acquired entities there can be no assurance that the company will engage in any acquisitions or divestitures or that the company will be able to do so on terms that will result in any expected benefits in addition acquisitions financed with borrowings could make the company more vulnerable to business downturns and could negatively affect the company’s earnings due to higher leverage and interest expense 

the company is subject to risk associated with global operations 

the company engages in business globally with approximately 47 of the company’s sales revenue in fiscal 2014 coming from outside the us this subjects the company to a number of risks including international economic political and labor conditions tax laws including us taxes on foreign subsidiaries increased financial accounting and reporting burdens and complexities unexpected changes in or impositions of legislative or regulatory requirements failure of laws to protect intellectual property rights adequately inadequate local infrastructure and difficulties in managing and staffing international operations delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology tariffs quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions transportation delays operating in locations with a higher incidence of corruption and fraudulent business practices and other factors beyond the company’s control including terrorism war natural disasters climate change and diseases 

the application of laws and regulations implicating global transactions is often unclear and may at times conflict compliance with these laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in the company’s business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability noncompliance could also result in fines damages criminal sanctions prohibitions business conduct and damage to the company’s reputation the company incurs additional legal compliance costs associated with its global operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if it does not comply with local laws and regulations which may be substantially different from those in the us 

the company conducts and plans to grow its business in developing markets 

the company’s efforts to grow its businesses depends to a degree on its success in developing market share in additional geographic markets including but not limited to china in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility and greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions than the company’s other markets operating and seeking to expand business in a number of different regions and countries exposes the company to multiple and potentially conflicting cultural practices business practices and legal and regulatory requirements 

in many foreign countries particularly in those with developing economies it may be common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by us regulations applicable to the company such as the foreign corrupt practices act although the company implements policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws there can be no assurance that all of the company’s employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which the company outsources certain aspects of its business operations including those based in foreign countries where practices which violate such us laws may be customary will comply with the company’s internal policies any such noncompliance even if prohibited by the company’s internal policies could have an adverse effect on the company’s business and result in significant fines or penalties 

  

the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates and changes to the strength of foreign governments and economic conditions 

approximately 30 of the company’s net sales in fiscal 2014 were made through its foreign subsidiaries which transact their sales in foreign currencies any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could therefore negatively affect the company’s revenues and earnings moreover the financial crisis faced by several eurozone countries and the ongoing economic instability in that region may lead to reduced spending on health care and research by eurozone governments which could adversely affect the company’s european sales as well as its revenues financial condition and results of operations 

the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in chemocentryx inc cyvek inc and other companies in which is does not have a majority interest the success of which is largely out of the company’s control 

the company’s expansion strategies include collaborations and investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company’s business these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected 

the company has an approximate 14 equity investment in chemocentryx inc ccxi that is valued at 371 million on the company’s june 30 2014 consolidated balance sheet ccxi is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and commercializing orallyadministered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and cancers the development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking ccxi is dependent on a limited number of products must achieve favorable clinical trial results obtain regulatory and marketing approval for these products and is reliant on a strategic alliance with glaxosmithkline ccxi has also incurred significant losses and has yet to achieve profitability 

the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares these factors make it possible that the company could experience future dilution or a decline in the 76 million unrealized gain it has on its ccxi investment andor its original 295 million investment in ccxi at august 22 2014 the market value of the company’s investment in ccxi was 309 million 

on april 1 2014 the company invested 10 million in cyvek inc in exchange for shares of cyvek’s common stock representing approximately 199 of the outstanding voting stock of cyvek in connection with this investment the company also became a party to cyvek’s existing investor agreements and has an observer seat on cyvek’s board of directors cyvek is an instrument company that has developed a microfluidics instrument platform and related reagents for performing immunoassays and other assays for the research market cyvek has incurred significant losses and has not yet achieved profitability there is no assurance that the company’s investment in cyvek will bring sufficient returns and may in fact result in losses 

the company’s success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production and management personnel are critical to the company’s success the company’s anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to protect and maintain its intellectual property including trade secrets the company attempts to protect trade secrets in part through confidentiality agreements but those agreements can be breached and if they are there may not be an adequate remedy if trade secrets become publicly known the company could lose its competitive position 

  

in addition the company’s success depends in part on its ability to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to obtain licenses where necessary or appropriate the company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties 

the company has been and may in the future be sued by third parties alleging that the company is infringing their intellectual property rights these lawsuits are expensive take significant time and divert management’s focus from other business concerns if the company is found to be infringing the intellectual property of others it could be required to cease certain activities alter its products or processes or pay licensing fees this would cause unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company if the company is unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms or unable to design around any third party patent it may be unable to sell some of its products and services which could result in reduced revenue in addition if the company does not prevail a court may find damages or award other remedies in favor of the opposing party in any of these suits which may adversely affect the company’s earnings 

the company has entered into and drawn on a revolving credit facility the burden of this additional debt could adversely affect the company make it more vulnerable to adverse economic or industry conditions and prevent it from funding its expansion strategy 

in connection with the acquisition of proteinsimple in july 2014 the company entered into a revolving credit facility governed by a credit agreement dated july 28 2014 the credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of 150 million which can be increased by an additional 150 million subject to certain conditions borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at a variable rate as of july 31 2014 the company had drawn 125 million under the credit agreement 

the terms of the credit agreement and the burden of the indebtedness incurred thereunder could have negative consequences for us such as 

 

  

  

 the credit agreement also contains negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions these covenants limit our ability to among other things sell lease or transfer any properties or assets with certain exceptions and enter into certain merger consolidation or other reorganization transactions with certain exceptions 

a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under our credit facility upon the occurrence of an event of default the lender could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit in addition the company would be subject to additional restrictions if an event of default exists under the credit agreement such as a prohibition on the payment of cash dividends 

  

the company’s business is subject to governmental laws and regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to regulation by various us federal state and international agencies laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the company’s operations including design development manufacturing labeling selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the company’s operations and ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval of the company’s products if the company fails to comply with any of these regulations it may become subject to fines penalties or actions that could impact development manufacturing and distribution andor increase costs or reduce sales the approval process applicable to clinical control products of the type that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the company’s revenues 

as a multinational corporation the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of us federal state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions from time to time new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments 

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products 

the company manufactures the majority of the products it sells at its minneapolis minnesota facility quality control packaging and distribution operations support all of the company’s sales since the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason particularly at the minneapolis facility could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the company’s future sales growth and earnings may be adversely affected by perceived disruption risks or actual disruptions 

the design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls litigation or alerts relating to the company’s products a recall could result in significant costs and damage to the company’s reputation which could reduce demand particularly for certain of its regulated products 

disruptions in the supply and cost of raw materials could reduce the company’s earnings cash flow and ability to meet customers’ needs 

the company’s products are made from a wide variety of raw materials that are generally available from alternate sources of supply however some of the company’s products are available only from a single supplier if such suppliers were to limit or terminate production or otherwise fail to supply these materials for any reason such failures could have a material adverse impact on the company’s product sales and business in addition price increases for raw materials could adversely affect the company’s earnings and cash flow 

increased exposure to product liability claims could adversely affect the company’s earnings 

product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products offered by the company’s customers currently these risks are primarily borne by the company’s customers as the company’s products and services are further integrated into customers’ production processes the company may become increasingly exposed to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of its products or services is alleged to have resulted in adverse effects there can be no assurance that a future product liability claim or series of claims brought against the company would not have an adverse effect on the company’s business or the results of operations the company’s business may be materially and adversely affected by a successful product liability claim or claims in excess of any insurance coverage that it may have in addition product liability claims regardless of their merits could be costly divert management’s attention and adversely affect the company’s reputation and demand for its products 

  

any such product liability claims brought against the company could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liabilities in excess of the company’s insurance coverage although the company carries product liability insurance it cannot be certain that current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claims or that it can be maintained on acceptable terms if at all 

cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality integrity and availability of the company’s computer hardware software and internet applications and related tools and functions could result in damage to the company’s reputation andor subject the company to costs fines or lawsuits 

the integrity and protection of the company’s own data and that of its customers and employees is critical to the company’s business the regulatory environment governing information security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase the company’s operating costs andor adversely impact the company’s ability to market its products and services to customers although the company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards it is still vulnerable to fire storm flood power loss earthquakes telecommunications failures physical or software breakins software viruses and similar events these events could lead to the unauthorized access disclosure and use of nonpublic information the techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world as a result the company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures if the company’s computer systems are compromised it could be subject to fines damages litigation and enforcement actions customers could curtail or cease using its applications and the company could lose trade secrets the occurrence of which could harm its business

overall results

consolidated gaap net earnings decreased 1 for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 after adjusting for acquisition related costs and certain income tax items in both years adjusted net earnings increased 6 in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings growth was driven by increased sales partially offset by a lower margin mix from the acquired bionostics business as well as investments made in commercial operations and administrative infrastructure during fiscal 2014 

for fiscal 2013 consolidated net sales decreased 1 as compared to fiscal 2012 there were no acquisitions made in fiscal 2013 or fiscal 2012 and the impact from foreign currency fluctuation was minimal the us market in the biotechnology segment was particularly soft in 2013 with lower national institute of health nih funding for our academic customers coupled with industry consolidation in the pharma and biotech markets

results of operations 

net sales 

consolidated organic net sales excluding the impact of net sales contributed by companies acquired during the fiscal year and the effect of the change from the prior year in exchange rates used to convert sales in foreign currencies primarily british pound sterling euros and chinese yuan into us dollars were as follows in thousands 

 

  

 net sales by reportable segment were as follows in thousands 

 

 in fiscal 2014 biotechnology segment net sales increased 4 from the prior fiscal year included in fiscal 2014 biotechnology segment net sales was 07 million from the acquisition of primegene in april 2014 and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 35 million excluding these amounts organic net sales for the segment increased 3 in fiscal 2014 driven by the commercial investments made in china solid execution from our pacific rim distributors and a robust pharma and biotech market in the us us academic customers still suffered from decreases in nih funding but sales to these customers stabilized sequentially throughout fiscal 2014 included in fiscal 2014 net sales were 34 million of sales of new biotechnology products released during the fiscal year 

in fiscal 2013 biotechnology segment net sales decreased 2 from the prior fiscal year biotechnology segment organic net sales excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations of 26 million decreased 1 in fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of lower nih funding and pharma consolidation in the us included in fiscal 2013 net sales were 28 million of sales of new biotechnology products during the fiscal year 

clinical controls segment net sales increased 348 million in fiscal 2014 included in clinical controls segment net sales was 331 million from the acquisition of bionostics in july 2013 clinical controls segment organic net sales increased 7 and 5 respectively in fiscal 2014 and 2013 from each of the prior fiscal years primarily as a result of strong endmarket demand and operational execution 

gross margins 

consolidated gross margins were 70 74 and 75 in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively gaap reported consolidated gross margins were negatively impacted as a result of purchase accounting related to inventory and intangible assets acquired during fiscal 2014 and prior years under purchase accounting inventory is valued at fair value less expected selling and marketing costs resulting in reduced margins in future periods as the inventory is sold excluding the impact of acquired inventory sold and amortization of intangibles adjusted gross margins were 74 77 and 78 in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

  

a reconciliation of the reported consolidated gross margin percentages adjusted for acquired inventory sold and intangible amortization included in cost of sales is as follows 

 

 fluctuations in adjusted gross margins as a percentage of net sales have primarily resulted from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in product mix in fiscal 2014 the biggest impact to gross margin as compared to fiscal 2013 was the change in product mix associated with the acquisition of bionostics we expect that in the future gross margins will continue to be impacted by future acquisitions as well as by the introduction and growth of lowerpriced brands that will differentiate from our current premium brands and allow the company to better compete in more pricesensitive markets 

segment gross margins as a percentage of net sales were as follows 

 

 the clinical controls segment gross margin percentage for fiscal 2014 was negatively impacted by purchase accounting and intangible asset amortization related to the acquisition of bionostics in july 2013 as discussed above 

selling general and administrative expenses

 interest income 

interest income for fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 was 27 million 26 million and 26 million respectively interest income in fiscal 2014 remained flat from fiscal 2013 as a result of lower cash balances during the fiscal year as a result of the acquisition of bionostics in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 interest income in fiscal 2013 remained flat from fiscal 2012 as a result of increased cash balances offset by lower interest rates 

as discussed further in “liquidity and capital resources” below with the opening of a debt facility in july 2014 to partially fund the acquisition of proteinsimple the company expects to incur net interest expense as opposed to net interest income in fiscal 2015

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this report the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of june 30 2014 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2014 in making this assessment our management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “internal control – integrated framework 1992” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management has determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of june 30 2014 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis at june 30 2013 the company identified a material weakness in the design implementation and operating effectiveness of general it controls gitcs intended to ensure that access to financial applications and data was adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and that program changes to particular financial applications are documented tested and moved into the production environment only by individuals separate from the development function as a result certain classes of transactions subject to controls that rely upon information generated by the company’s it systems that are subject to the operation of the gitcs including the completeness existence and accuracy of revenue and accounts receivable allow for a reasonable possibility that a misstatement is not adequately prevented or detected through the operation of management’s system of internal control over financial reporting 

in light of the material weakness identified above at june 30 2013 the company performed additional analysis and other postclosing procedures to ensure that the company’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and accurately reflect its financial position and results of operation as of and for the year ended june 30 2013 

during fiscal 2014 the company enhanced its internal testing approach including performing additional procedures and expanding the documentation for select controls to ensure the completeness existence and accuracy of system generated information used to support the operation of the controls as of june 30 2014 the company’s management has concluded that the enhanced testing and the expansion of human resources to improve segregation of duties have remediated the material weakness 

  

the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2014 has been audited by kpmg llp as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

other than the remediation actions described above there were no other material changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended june 30 2014 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

biotechnology segment 

the company through its biotechnology segment is one of the world’s leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines and related reagents to the biotechnology research community these valuable proteins are produced in minute amounts by different types of cells and can be isolated from these cells or synthesized through recombinant dna technology currently nearly all of the company’s proteins are produced by recombinant dna technology 

the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues cytokines are intercellular messengers they act as signaling agents by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell tissue or organ for example cytokines can induce cells to acquire more specialized functions and features another example of the beneficial action of cytokines is their key role played in attracting cells at the site of injury inducing them to grow and divide and initiate the healing process unregulated cytokine production and action can have nonbeneficial effects and lead to various pathologies 

  

the company also produces and markets enzymes and intracellular signaling reagents enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts that accelerate a variety of chemical reactions in cells most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins additionally both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases and conditions including cancer alzheimer’s arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation aids and influenza 

the company markets a variety of immunoassays on different testing platforms including a microtiter plated based kit sold under the trade name quantikine ®  immunoassays based on encoded beads technology and immunoassays based on spotted surfaces all of these immunoassay products are used by researchers to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine protein quantification is an integral component of basic research and as a valuable indicator of the effects of new therapeutic compounds in the pharmaceutical drug discovery and development process 

with the acquisition of tocris in april 2011 the company added chemicallybased products to its biotechnology segment tocris products are small compounds sold in highly purified forms typically with agonistic or antagonistic properties in a variety of biological processes the addition of tocris products to the company’s product lines allows customers to have access to the broadest range of compounds and biological reagents to meet their life science research needs the company’s combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio provide new tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge which may lead to a fuller understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies 

the company currently manufactures and sells approximately 24000 biotechnology products 

biotechnology products 

proteins cytokines and enzymes extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest possible purity proteins including enzyme substrates and inhibitors are highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest biological activity 

antibodies antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that recognize and bind to target molecules the company’s polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats sheep and rabbits and purified from the animals’ blood monoclonal antibodies are derived from immortalized rodent cell lines and are isolated from cell culture medium 

immunoassays the immunoassay product line includes quantikine kits for the detection of human and animal proteins using 96well plates along with immunoassays on other testing platforms which allow researchers to quantify the amount of a specific analyte typically a cytokine adhesion molecule or an enzyme in a sample derived from any biological fluid 

clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits the company has received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for its erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin ß2m immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices 

flow cytometry products this product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits which are used to determine the immunophenotypic properties of cells from different tissues 

intracellular signaling products this diverse product line provides reagents to elucidate signal transduction pathways within cells products include antibodies phosphospecific antibodies antibody arrays active caspases kinases phosphatases and enzymelinked immunosorbant assay elisa assays to measure the activity of apoptotic and signaling molecules 

small molecule chemicallybased products these products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists antagonists andor inhibitors of various biological functions used in concert with other company products they provide additional tools to elucidate key pathways of cellular functions and can provide insight into the drug discovery process 

  

the company sells its biotechnology products directly to customers in north america most of western europe and to certain customers in china third party distributors are used in the remainder of china and europe and in the rest of the world 

clinical controls segment formerly the hematology segment 

proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patient’s blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is a complete blood count cbc doctors use this test in disease screening and diagnosis 

hematology controls and calibrators are products derived from various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized control and calibrator products can be utilized to ensure that hematology instruments are performing accurately and reliably ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately in addition most instruments need to be calibrated periodically hematology calibrators are similar to controls but undergo additional testing to ensure that the calibration values assigned are within tight specifications and can be used to calibrate the instrument 

the company offers a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters the company believes its products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors hematology control products are also supplied for use as proficiency testing tools by laboratory certifying authorities in a number of states and countries 

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for clinical controls made by the company in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 oem agreements accounted for 108 million 97 million and 87 million respectively or 3 of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year the company sells its clinical control products directly to customers in the united states and through distributors in the rest of the world 

products under development 

the company is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its major product lines controls and calibrators and cytokines antibodies assays small bioactive molecules and related biotechnology products the company believes that its future success depends to a large extent on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and markets at the same time the company continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality and maximum efficiency 

in fiscal 2013 the company introduced 2100 new biotechnology products the company is planning to release new proteins antibodies immunoassay products and chemicallybased research reagents in the coming year all of these products will be for research use only and therefore do not require fda clearance the company also developed several new clinical diagnostic products in fiscal 2013 and is continuously working to expand these product lines along with ongoing product improvements and enhancements however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

government regulation 

all manufacturers of clinical diagnostic controls are regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended all of the company’s clinical control products are classified as “ in vitro diagnostic products” by the fda the entire control manufacturing process from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their expiration date is strictly regulated and documented fda inspectors make periodic site inspections of the company’s clinical control operations and facilities clinical control manufacturing must comply with quality system regulations qsr as set forth in the fda’s regulations governing medical devices 

three of the company’s immunoassay kits epo tfr and ß2m have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use the company must comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits biotechnology products manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do not require fda clearance tocris products are used as research tools and require no regulatory approval for commercialization some of tocris’ products are considered controlled substances and require government permits to stock such products and to ship them to endusers the company has no reason to believe that these annual permits will not be reissued 

  

some of the company’s research groups use small amounts of radioactive materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development activities thus the company is subject to regulation and inspection by the minnesota department of health and has been granted a license through august 2014 the license is renewable annually the company has had no difficulties in renewing this license in prior years and has no reason to believe it will not be renewed in the future if however the license was not renewed it would have minimal effect on the company’s business since there are other technologies the research groups could use to replace the use of radioisotopes 

beginning january 1 2013 the company was subject to the medical device excise tax which was included as part of the affordable care act the tax applies to the sale of medical devices by a manufacturer producer or importer of the device and is 23 of the sale price the tax applies to the company’s in vitro diagnostic products including its clinical control products and biotechnology clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits the company’s medical device excise tax for fiscal 2013 was 91000 

availability of raw materials 

the primary raw material for the company’s clinical controls is whole blood human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks while porcine and bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants after raw blood is received it is separated into its components processed and stabilized although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business the company does not perform its own pathogen testing as the supplier tests all human blood purchased 

rd systems’ biotechnology division develops and manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed inhouse thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources rd systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of products tocris sources its raw material from multiple worldwide sources many of the starting components used in the chemical synthesis are widely available products and no single source of raw reagents poses a supply risk to this business 

patents and trademarks 

the company owns patent protection for certain clinical controls which extend for various periods depending on the date of the patent application or patent grant the company is not substantially dependent on products for which it has obtained patent protection sales of such products are not material to the company’s financial results 

the company may seek patent protection for new or existing products it manufactures no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will be obtained no assurance can be given that the company’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others particularly for genetically engineered products the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products for more information on patent litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k 

the company has a number of licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the nonexclusive right to use patented technology or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented proteins and related products to the research market for fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 33 million 32 million and 34 million respectively 

the company has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its clinical controls and biotechnology product groups which extend for various periods depending upon the date of the trademark grant the company believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered 

seasonality of business 

biotechnology segment products marketed by the company historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months the company also usually experiences a slowing of sales in both of its reportable segments during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period the company believes this seasonality is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan and of academic schedules in the united states 

  

significant customers 

no single customer in either reportable segment accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2013 2012 or 2011 

backlog 

there was no significant backlog of orders for the company’s products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2012 the majority of the company’s biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders the majority of the company’s clinical control products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule 

competition 

the worldwide market for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents is being supplied by a number of companies including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc life technologies corporation millipore corporation peprotech inc santa cruz biotechnology inc abcam plc sigmaaldrich corporation thermo fisher scientific inc cayman chemical company and enzo biochem inc the company believes that it is one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research marketplace the company further believes that the expanding line of its products their recognized quality and the growing demand for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents will allow the company to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market 

competition is intense in the clinical control business the first control products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell counting historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made controls for use in their own instruments with rapid expansion of the instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled noninstrument manufacturers to gain a foothold today the market is composed of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers the principal clinical diagnostic control competitors for the company’s retail products are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc streck inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation the company believes it is the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc

 item 1a risk factors 

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the company’s actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the company’s actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the company’s business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the company’s other sec filings could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 

a major element of the company’s growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases as a result the company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs new product development requires planning designing and testing at both technological and manufacturingprocess levels and may require significant research and development expenditures there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that the company may seek to develop in the future will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance there can also be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company’s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 

  

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings 

the company’s biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by the company’s customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions an economic downturn or a reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the company’s products the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 

the biotechnology and clinical control industries are very competitive 

the company faces significant competition across all of its product lines and in each market in which it operates competitors include companies ranging from startup companies who may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial and marketing resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have served to create fewer customer accounts andor to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company the entry into the market of manufacturers in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’ actions may impact the company’s future sales and earnings 

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products 

the company manufactures the majority of the products it sells at its minneapolis minnesota facility quality control packaging and distribution operations support all of the company’s sales since the company creates value for its customers through the development of highquality products any significant decline in quality or disruption of operations for any reason could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the company’s ability to provide products in the longer term could adversely affect future sales growth and earnings 

the design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls litigation or alerts relating to the company’s products a recall could result in significant costs and damage to the company’s reputation which could reduce demand for its products 

the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates 

approximately 31 of the company’s sales are made through its foreign subsidiaries which transact their sales in foreign currencies the company’s revenues and earnings are therefore affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the company’s revenues and earnings 

the company conducts and plans to grow its business in developing markets

the company faces risk resulting from the economic instability in the eurozone countries 

sales in europe made up approximately 28 of the company’s net sales in fiscal 2013 as a result of several eurozone countries facing fiscal crises and uncertainty about the continued viability of the euro as a single currency the company’s european sales may be adversely affected by reduced spending on health care and research by eurozone governments and general economic instability in the region such reduced sales would adversely affect the company’s revenues financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production and management personnel are critical to the company’s success the company’s anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s business is subject to governmental laws and regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to regulation by various us federal state and international agencies laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the company’s operations including design development manufacturing labeling selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the company’s operations if the company fails to comply with any of these regulations it may become subject to fines penalties or actions that could impact development manufacturing and distribution andor increase costs or reduce sales the approval process applicable to clinical control products of the type that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the company’s revenues 

as a multinational corporation the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions from time to time new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments 

the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights 

the company’s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

the company has investments in marketable securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale these securities may include us government and agency securities state and municipal securities foreign government securities us and foreign corporate debt and equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its availableforsale securities any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results given the global nature of its business the company has investments both domestically and internationally credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of the company’s availableforsale investments could decline and result in a material impairment which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

  

the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in chemocentryx inc and other companies the success of which is largely out of the company’s control 

the company’s expansion strategies include collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company’s business and the acquisition of businesses for new products technologies and additional customer base these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected 

the company has an approximate 150 equity investment in chemocentryx inc ccxi that is valued at 896 million on the company’s june 30 2013 balance sheet ccxi is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and commercializing orallyadministered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and cancers the development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking ccxi is dependent on a limited number of products must achieve favorable clinical trial results obtain regulatory and marketing approval for these products and is reliant on a strategic alliance with glaxosmithkline ccxi has also incurred significant losses and has yet to achieve profitability 

the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares these factors make it possible that the company could experience future dilution or a substantial decline in the 602 million unrealized gain it has on its ccxi investment andor its 295 million investment in ccxi at august 26 2013 the market value of the company’s investment in ccxi was 512 million and its unrealized gain declined to 218 million 

we have identified a material weakness in our internal controls that if not properly corrected could adversely affect our operations and result in material misstatements in our financial statements 

as described in “item 9a controls and procedures” we have identified a material weakness in our system of internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013 a material weakness is a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the company has identified a material weakness in the design implementation and operating effectiveness of general it controls gitcs intended to ensure that access to financial applications and data was adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and that program changes to particular financial applications are documented tested and moved into the production environment only by individuals separate from the development function as a result certain classes of transactions subject to controls that rely upon information generated by the company’s it systems that are subject to the operation of the gitcs including the completeness existence and accuracy of revenue and accounts receivable allow for a reasonable possibility that a misstatement is not adequately prevented or detected through the operation of management’s system of internal control over financial reporting 

in response to the material weakness we have developed a plan to enhance our internal testing approach including related procedures documentation and possible expansion of human resources for select controls to ensure that we have adequately addressed the completeness and accuracy of systemgenerated information used to support the operation of the controls and to improve segregation of duties 

although there can be no assurances we believe these enhancements and improvements when repeated in future periods will remediate the material weakness described above however if we are not able to remedy the material weakness in a timely manner we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner and we may incorrectly report financial information either of these events could subject us to regulatory enforcement and other actions and could have a material adverse effect on our operations investor supplier and customer confidence in our reported financial information and the trading price of our common stock

the company has made equity investments in several startup and early development stage companies among them nephromics h2equity and actgen inc actgen the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity method is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to the company’s share in the equity of the investee and the company’s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee in determining which accounting treatment to apply the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment 

the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor us food and drug administration fda clearance to market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment 

in fiscal 2012 the company determined that its investment in nephromics was partially impaired and wrote off 24 million as an impairment loss the company’s net investment in nephromics was 505000 at june 30 2013 the company also determined that its investment in actgen was fully impaired and wrote off 854000 as an impairment loss in fiscal 2012 during fiscal 2012 h2equity entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of its assets the sale closed in april 2013 the company received a 11 million distribution at closing and recorded a gain of 708000 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures 

about market risk 

at the end of fiscal 2013 the company had a portfolio of fixed income debt securities excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents of 212 million see note c to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase the company’s investment policy requires all investment in shortterm and longterm securities to have at least debt ratings of a1 or a3 or the equivalent respectively as the company’s fixed income securities are classified as availableforsale unrealized gains or losses are recognized by the company in “other comprehensive income loss” on the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income the company generally holds its fixed income securities until maturity and historically has not recorded any material gains or losses on any sale prior to maturity 

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 31 of consolidated net sales are made in foreign currencies including 15 in euro 7 in british pound sterling 4 in chinese yuan and the remaining 5 in other european currencies as a result the company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling and the chinese yuan as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company’s foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation 

monthend exchange rates between the british pound sterling euro and chinese yuan and the us dollar which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods were as follows 

  

 the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements but receivable or payable in another currency at june 30 2013 the company had the following trade receivable and intercompany payables denominated in one currency but receivable or payable in another currency in thousands 

 

 all of the above balances are revolving in nature and are not deemed to be longterm balances 

the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in “other nonoperating expense net” in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” 

the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10 appreciation in the us dollar from june 30 2013 levels against the euro british pound sterling and chinese yuan are as follows in thousands

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

as required by rule 13a15b of the securities exchange act of 1934 the “exchange act” management with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated as of the end of the period covered by this report the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in exchange act rule 13a15e based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that is described below in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of june 30 2013 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with gaap because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013 in making this assessment our management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in “internal control—integrated framework 1992” issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management has determined that due to the material weaknesses described below our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of june 30 2013 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the company has identified a material weakness in the design implementation and operating effectiveness of general it controls gitcs intended to ensure that access to financial applications and data was adequately restricted to appropriate personnel and that program changes to particular financial applications are documented tested and moved into the production environment only by individuals separate from the development function as a result certain classes of transactions subject to controls that rely upon information generated by the company’s it systems that are subject to the operation of the gitcs including the completeness existence and accuracy of revenue and accounts receivable allow for a reasonable possibility that a misstatement is not adequately prevented or detected through the operation of management’s system of internal control over financial reporting 

  

remediation plan for material weakness in internal control over financial reporting 

in light of the material weakness identified above the company performed additional analysis and other postclosing procedures to ensure that the company’s consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and accurately reflect its financial position and results of operation as of and for the year ended june 30 2013 as a result notwithstanding the material weakness as described above management concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k present fairly in all material respects the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented 

in response to the material weakness we have developed a plan with the oversight of the audit committee of the board of directors to remediate the material weakness 

we will enhance our internal testing approach including related procedures documentation and possible expansion of human resources for select controls to ensure that we have adequately addressed the completeness and accuracy of system generated information used to support the operation of the controls and to improve segregation of duties 

the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of june 30 2013 has been audited by kpmg llp as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein 

with the actions described in this item 9a we conclude that the consolidated financial statements included in this 2013 annual report on form 10k fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there were no other material changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by rule 13a15e that occurred during the quarter ended june 30 2013 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

the company has two reportable segments based on the nature of its products biotechnology and hematology rd systems’ biotechnology division rd europe tocris rd china biospacific and boston biochem operating segments are included in the biotechnology reporting segment the company’s biotechnology reporting segment develops manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide the company’s hematology reporting segment which consists of rd systems’ hematology division develops and manufactures hematology controls and calibrators for sale worldwide 

the market 

the company manufactures and sells products for the biotechnology research market and the clinical diagnostics market in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 net sales from the company’s biotechnology segment were 93 of consolidated net sales in each year the company’s hematology segment net sales were 7 of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 financial information relating to the company’s segments is incorporated herein by reference to note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

biotechnology segment 

the company through its biotechnology segment is one of the world’s leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines and related reagents to the biotechnology research community these valuable proteins are produced in minute amounts by different types of cells and can be isolated from these cells or synthesized through recombinant dna technology currently nearly all of the company’s proteins are produced by recombinant dna technology 

the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues cytokines are intercellular messengers they act as signaling agents by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell tissue or organ for example cytokines can induce cells to acquire more specialized functions and features another example of the beneficial action of cytokines is their key role played in attracting cells at the site of injury inducing them to grow and divide and initiate the healing process unregulated cytokine production and action can have nonbeneficial effects and lead to various pathologies 

the company also produces and markets enzymes and intracellular signaling reagents enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts that accelerate a variety of chemical reactions in cells most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins additionally both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases and conditions including cancer alzheimer’s arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation aids and influenza 

  

the company markets one type of immunoassay kit under the trade name quantikine ®  quantikine kits are used by researchers to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine protein quantification is an integral component of basic research and as a valuable indicator of the effects of new therapeutic compounds in the pharmaceutical drug discovery and development process 

with the acquisition of tocris in april 2011 the company added chemicallybased products to its biotechnology segment tocris products are small compounds sold in highly purified forms typically with agonistic or antagonistic properties in a variety of biological processes the addition of tocris products to the company’s product lines allows customers to have access to the broadest range of compounds and biological reagents to meet their life science research needs the combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio of the two companies provide new tools which customers can use in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge which may lead to a fuller understanding of biological processes and ultimately to the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies 

the company currently manufactures and sells approximately 22000 biotechnology products 

biotechnology products 

proteins cytokines and enzymes extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest possible purity proteins including enzyme substrates and inhibitors are highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest biological activity 

antibodies antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that recognize and bind to target molecules the company’s polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats sheep and rabbits and purified from the animals’ blood monoclonal antibodies are derived from immortalized rodent cell lines and are isolated from cell culture medium 

immunoassays the immunoassay product line includes quantikine kits for the detection of human and animal proteins using 96well plates along with immunoassays on other testing platforms which allow researchers to quantify the amount of a specific analyte typically a cytokine adhesion molecule or an enzyme in a sample derived from any biological fluid 

clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits the company has received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for its erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin ß2m immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices 

flow cytometry products this product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits which are used to determine the immunophenotypic properties of cells from different tissues 

intracellular signaling products this diverse product line provides reagents to elucidate signal transduction pathways within cells products include antibodies phosphospecific antibodies antibody arrays active caspases kinases phosphatases and enzymelinked immunosorbant assay elisa assays to measure the activity of apoptotic and signaling molecules 

chemicallybased products these products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists antagonists andor inhibitors of various biological functions used in concert with other company products they provide additional tools to elucidate key pathways of cellular functions and can provide insight into the drug discovery process 

the company sells its biotechnology products directly to customers in north america most of western europe and to certain customers in china third party distributors are used in the remainder of china and europe and in the rest of the world 

  

hematology segment 

proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patient’s blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is a complete blood count cbc doctors use this test in disease screening and diagnosis 

hematology controls and calibrators are products derived from various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized control and calibrator products can be utilized to ensure that hematology instruments are performing accurately and reliably ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately in addition most instruments need to be calibrated periodically hematology calibrators are similar to controls but undergo additional testing to ensure that the calibration values assigned are within tight specifications and can be used to calibrate the instrument 

the company offers a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters the company believes its products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors hematology control products are also supplied for use as proficiency testing tools by laboratory certifying authorities in a number of states and countries 

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for hematology controls and calibrators made by the company in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 oem agreements accounted for 97 million 87 million and 80 million respectively or 3 of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year the company sells its hematology products directly to customers in the united states and through distributors in the rest of the world 

products under development 

the company is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its major product lines controls and calibrators hematology and cytokines antibodies assays and related products biotechnology the company believes that its future success depends to a large extent on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and markets at the same time the company continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality and maximum efficiency 

in fiscal 2012 the company introduced 1800 new biotechnology products the company is planning to release new proteins antibodies immunoassay products and chemicallybased research reagents in the coming year all of these products will be for research use only and therefore do not require fda clearance the company also developed several new hematology control products in fiscal 2012 and is continuously working on product improvements and enhancements however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

government regulation 

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended all of the company’s hematology control products are classified as “ in vitro diagnostic products” by the fda the entire hematology control manufacturing process from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their expiration date is strictly regulated and documented fda inspectors make periodic site inspections of the company’s hematology control operations and facilities hematology control manufacturing must comply with quality system regulations qsr as set forth in the fda’s regulations governing medical devices 

  

three of the company’s immunoassay kits epo tfr and ß2m have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use the company must comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits biotechnology products manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do not require fda clearance 

both boston biochem and tocris products are used as research tools and require no regulatory approval for commercialization some of tocris’ products are considered controlled substances and require government permits to stock such products and to ship them to endusers the company has no reason to believe that these annual permits will not be reissued 

some of the company’s research groups use small amounts of radioactive materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development activities thus the company is subject to regulation and inspection by the minnesota department of health and has been granted a license through august 2013 the license is renewable annually the company has had no difficulties in renewing this license in prior years and has no reason to believe it will not be renewed in the future if however the license was not renewed it would have minimal effect on the company’s business since there are other technologies the research groups could use to replace the use of radioisotopes 

beginning january 1 2013 the company will be subject to the medical device excise tax which was included as part of the affordable care act the tax applies to the sale of medical devices by a manufacturer producer or importer of the device and is 23 of the sale price the tax will apply to the company’s in vitro diagnostic products including its hematology products and biotechnology clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits the company estimates it will pay approximately 250000 for the medical device excise tax in fiscal 2013 

availability of raw materials 

the primary raw material for the company’s hematology controls is whole blood human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks while porcine and bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants after raw blood is received it is separated into its components processed and stabilized although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business the company does not perform its own pathogen testing as the supplier tests all human blood purchased 

rd systems’ biotechnology division develops and manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed inhouse thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources rd systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of products tocris sources its raw material from multiple worldwide sources many of the starting components used in the chemical synthesis are widely available products and no single source of raw reagents poses a supply risk to this business 

patents and trademarks 

the company owns patent protection for certain hematology controls which extend for various periods depending on the date of the patent application or patent grant the company is not substantially dependent on products for which it has obtained patent protection sales of such products are not material to the company’s financial results 

the company may seek patent protection for new or existing products it manufactures no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will be obtained no assurance can be given that the company’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others particularly for genetically engineered products the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products for more information on patent litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k 

the company has a number of licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the nonexclusive right to use patented technology or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented proteins and related products to the research market for fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 32 million 34 million and 33 million respectively 

  

the company has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its hematology controls and biotechnology product groups which extend for various periods depending upon the date of the trademark grant the company believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered 

seasonality of business 

biotechnology segment products marketed by the company historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months the company also usually experiences a slowing of sales in both of its reportable segments during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period the company believes this seasonality is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan and of academic schedules in the united states 

significant customers 

no single customer in either reportable segment accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2012 2011 or 2010 

backlog 

there was no significant backlog of orders for the company’s products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2011 the majority of the company’s biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders the majority of hematology products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule 

competition 

the worldwide market for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents is being supplied by a number of companies including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc life technologies corporation millipore corporation peprotech inc santa cruz biotechnology inc abcam plc sigmaaldrich corporation thermo fisher scientific inc cayman chemical company and enzo biochem inc the company believes that it is one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research marketplace the company further believes that the expanding line of its products their recognized quality and the growing demand for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents will allow the company to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market 

competition is intense in the hematology control business the first control products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell counting historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made controls for use in their own instruments with rapid expansion of the instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled noninstrument manufacturers to gain a foothold today the market is composed of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers the principal hematology control competitors for the company’s hematology retail products are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc streck inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation the company believes it is the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc

 item 1a risk factors 

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the company’s actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the company’s actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements 

  

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the company’s business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the company’s other sec filings could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 

a major element of the company’s growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases as a result the company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs new product development requires planning designing and testing at both technological and manufacturingprocess levels and may require significant research and development expenditures there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that the company may seek to develop in the future will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance there can also be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company’s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings 

the company’s biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by the company’s customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions an economic downturn or a reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the company’s products the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 

the biotechnology and hematology industries are very competitive 

the company faces significant competition across all of its product lines and in each market in which it operates competitors include companies ranging from startup companies who may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial and marketing resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have served to create fewer customer accounts andor to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company the entry into the market of manufacturers in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’ actions may impact the company’s future sales and earnings 

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products 

the company manufactures the majority of the products it sells at its minneapolis minnesota facility quality control packaging and distribution operations support all of the company’s sales any significant disruption of these operations for any reason could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the company’s ability to provide products in the longer term could adversely affect future sales growth and earnings 

the design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls litigation or alerts relating to the company’s products a recall could result in significant costs and damage to the company’s reputation which could reduce demand for its products 

  

the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates 

approximately 30 of the company’s sales are made through its foreign subsidiaries which transact their sales in foreign currencies the company’s revenues and earnings are therefore affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the company’s revenues and earnings 

the company faces risk resulting from the economic instability in the eurozone countries 

sales to europe made up approximately 29 of the company’s net sales in fiscal 2012 as a result of several eurozone countries facing fiscal crises and uncertainty about the continued viability of the euro as a single currency the company’s european sales may be adversely affected by reduced spending on health care and research by eurozone governments and general economic instability in the region such reduced sales would adversely affect the company’s revenues financial condition and results of operations 

the company may be unsuccessful in integrating boston biochem and tocris into its operations 

the actual financial results of boston biochem and tocris could differ from the company’s forecasts effecting the company’s future sales and net earnings if the integrations of the acquired businesses are not successful the company may record unexpected impairment charges factors that will affect the success of the acquisitions include any decrease in customer loyalty caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines or its sales and marketing practices including price increases the ability to retain key employees and the ability of the company to achieve synergies among its subsidiary companies such synergies include leveraging the combined companies’ sales and marketing efforts achieving certain cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products 

the company’s success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production and management personnel are critical to the company’s success the company’s anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s business is subject to governmental laws and regulations 

the company’s operations are subject to regulation by various us federal state and international agencies laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the company’s operations including design development manufacturing labeling selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the company’s operations if the company fails to comply with any of these regulations it may become subject to fines penalties or actions that could impact development manufacturing and distribution andor increase costs or reduce sales the approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the company’s revenues 

as a multinational corporation the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions from time to time new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments 

  

the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights 

the company’s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

the company has investments in marketable securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale these securities include us government and agency securities foreign government and agency securities corporate debt and equity securities and certificates of deposit these investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its availableforsale securities any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results given the global nature of its business the company has investments both domestically and internationally credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of the company’s availableforsale investments could decline and result in a material impairment which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in chemocentryx inc and other companies the success of which is largely out of the company’s control 

the company’s expansion strategies include collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company’s business and the acquisition of businesses for new products technologies and additional customer base these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected 

the company has an approximate 180 equity investment in chemocentryx inc ccxi that is valued at 947 million on the company’s june 30 2012 balance sheet ccxi is a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering developing and commercializing orallyadministered therapeutics to treat autoimmune diseases inflammatory diseases and cancers the development of new drugs is a highly risky undertaking ccxi is dependent on a limited number of products must achieve favorable clinical trial results obtain regulatory and marketing approval for these products and is reliant on a strategic alliance with glaxosmithkline ccxi has also incurred significant losses and has yet to achieve profitability 

the ownership of ccxi shares is very concentrated the share price is highly volatile and there is limited trading of the shares these factors make it possible that the company could experience future dilution or a substantial decline in the 652 million unrealized gain it has on its ccxi investment andor its 295 million investment in ccxi

the fair value of inventory purchased in fiscal 2011 through the acquisitions of boston biochem and tocris were determined based on quantities acquired selling prices at the date of acquisition and management’s assumptions regarding inventory having future value and the costs to sell such inventories at the acquisition dates the value of acquired inventory was increased 257 million for a total acquired inventory value of 330 million in addition the company acquired inventory that was not valued as part of the purchase price allocation as it was in excess of forecasted usage the increase in value of the acquired inventory remaining at june 30 2012 was 152 million 

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 

when a business is acquired the purchase price is allocated as applicable between tangible assets identifiable intangible assets and goodwill determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets requires significant estimates the fair value of intangible assets acquired in fiscal 2011 including developed technologies trade names customer relationships and a noncompete agreement were based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows using a relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings method with consideration to other factors including an independent valuation of management’s assumptions intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years the company reviews the carrying amount of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 465 million at june 30 2012 

  

goodwill recognized in connection with a business acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units the company’s annual assessment included a qualitative assessment of whether it is morelikelythannot that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value a significant change in the company’s market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed as of june 30 2012 as the fair values of the company’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values goodwill at june 30 2012 was 857 million 

valuation of investments 

the company has made equity investments in several startup and early development stage companies among them nephromics hemerus medical llc hemerus and actgen inc actgen the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity method is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to the company’s share in the equity of the investee and the company’s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee in determining which accounting treatment to apply the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment 

the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor us food and drug administration fda clearance to market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment in fiscal 2012 the company determined that its investment in nephromics was partially impaired and wrote off 24 million as an impairment loss the company also determined that its investment in actgen was fully impaired and wrote off 854000 as an impairment loss the company’s net investments at june 30 2012 in nephromics and hemerus were 505000 and 551000 respectively 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures 

about market risk 

at the end of fiscal 2012 the company had a portfolio of fixed income debt securities excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents of 202 million see note c to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase the company’s investment policy requires all investment in shortterm and longterm securities to have at least debt ratings of a1 or a3 or the equivalent respectively as the company’s fixed income securities are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are recognized by the company in its consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity the company generally holds its fixed income securities until maturity and historically has not recorded any material gains or losses on any sale prior to maturity 

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates approximately 30 of consolidated net sales are made in foreign currencies including 15 in euro 7 in british pound sterling 3 in chinese yuan and the remaining 5 in other european currencies as a result the company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling and the chinese yuan as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company’s foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation 

  

monthend exchange rates between the british pound sterling euro and chinese yuan and the us dollar which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods were as follows 

 

 the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements but receivable or payable in another currency at june 30 2012 the company had the following trade receivable and intercompany payables denominated in one currency but receivable or payable in another currency in thousands 

 

 all of the above balances are revolving in nature and are not deemed to be longterm balances 

the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in “other nonoperating expense net” in the consolidated statement of earnings and comprehensive income the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of “accumulated other comprehensive income loss” 

the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10 appreciation in the us dollar from june 30 2012 levels against the euro british pound sterling and chinese yuan are as follows in thousands

on april 1 2011 the company acquired for approximately 79 million cash the assets of boston biochem inc a leading developer and manufacturer of innovative ubiquitinrelated research products these products provide biomedical researchers the tools that facilitate and accelerate basic research and drug discovery efforts boston biochem was founded in 1997 and currently has over 800 ubiquitinrelated products the ubiquitin proteasome pathway is the principal system for protein degradation and signaling in eukaryotic cells ubiquitination also affects proteasomeindependent events such as protein localization activity and function these pathways are central to the regulation of almost all cellular processes ubiquitin and related pathways are associated with the regulation of numerous disease states including multiple cancers diabetes parkinson’s alzheimer’s cystic fibrosis angelman’s syndrome liddle syndrome and wilson’s disease 

on april 28 2011 the company acquired for £750 million cash approximately 124 million 100 ownership of tocris holdings limited and subsidiaries tocris a leading supplier of reagents for nonclinical life science research pursuant to the purchase agreement £75 million of the purchase price paid to tocris’ shareholders is being held in escrow for 18 months to secure warranty and indemnity obligations of the shareholders tocris’ products are used in both invitro and invivo experiments to understand biological processes and diseases the business is focused on making biologically active chemicals which are used by researchers to elucidate biological processes and pathways the products are used in lifescience research activities and as part of the initial drug discovery process tocris is a bristol uk based company with origins deriving from tocris neuramin and cookson chemical which were founded in 1982 and 1985 respectively tocris currently offers over 2900 chemical peptide and antibody products the principal end users are nonclinical laboratory based researchers working in areas such as neuroscience cardiovascular disease endocrinology and cellular processes originally a supplier of small molecules tocris has successfully pursued a strategy of extending its product range into related market segments such as signal transduction the products sold by tocris are used in various research fields including cancer cardiovascular disease endocrinology immunology metabolic diseases neurological diseases pain and inflammation and respiratory diseases from a cellular process perspective tocris products are used to study angiogenesis apoptosis cell cycle cell metabolism cellular skeleton and motor proteins extracellular matrix adhesion molecules signal transduction and stem cells tocris reagents are also used from a pharmacological perspective to study ion channels 7tm receptors nuclear receptors enzymelinked receptors transporter molecules and enzymes 

  

as a result of the above acquisitions the company has changed the presentation of its segment disclosure from three reporting segments biotechnology rd europe and hematology to two reporting segments biotechnology and hematology rd systems’ biotechnology division rd europe tocris rd china biospacific and boston biochem operating segments are included in the biotechnology reporting segment the company’s biotechnology reporting segment develops manufactures and sells biotechnology research and diagnostic products worldwide the company’s hematology reporting segment which consists of rd systems’ hematology division develops and manufactures hematology controls and calibrators for sale worldwide corresponding items of segment information have been revised for prior periods to conform to the current year presentation 

the market 

the company manufactures and sells products for the biotechnology research market and the clinical diagnostics market in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 net sales from the company’s biotechnology segment were 93 of consolidated net sales in each year the company’s hematology segment net sales were 7 of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 financial information relating to the company’s segments is incorporated herein by reference to note m to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k 

biotechnology segment 

the company through its biotechnology segment is one of the world’s leading suppliers of specialized proteins such as cytokines and related reagents to the biotechnology research community these valuable proteins are produced in minute amounts by different types of cells and can be isolated from these cells or synthesized through recombinant dna technology currently nearly all of the company’s proteins are produced by recombinant dna technology 

the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues cytokines are intercellular messengers they act as signals by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell tissue or organism for example cytokines can signal a cell to acquire the features necessary for it to take on a more specialized task another example of cytokine action is the key role played in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to grow and divide to attract migratory cells to the injury site and mediate the healing process 

the company also has enzymes and intracellular cell signaling reagents in its product portfolio enzymes are proteins which act as biological catalysts that accelerate a variety of chemical reactions in cells most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins additionally both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases and conditions including cancer alzheimer’s arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity inflammation aids and influenza 

the company markets one type of immunoassay kit under the trade name quantikine ®  quantikine kits are used by researchers to quantify the level of a specific protein in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine protein quantification is an integral component of basic research and as a valuable indicator of the effects of new compounds as candidates in the pharmaceutical drug discovery and development process 

  

with the acquisition of tocris in april 2011 the company added chemicallybased products to its biotechnology segment tocris products are chemicallybased small compounds sold in highly purified forms and with agonistic or antagonistic properties in a variety of biological processes the addition of tocris products to the company’s product lines allows customers to have access to the broadest range of compounds and biological reagents to meet their life science research needs the combined chemical and biological reagents portfolio of the two companies provide new tools which can be used in solving the complexity of important biological pathways and glean knowledge which may lead to a fuller understanding of biological processes and ultimately the development of novel strategies to address different pathologies 

the company currently manufactures and sells over 20000 biotechnology products 

biotechnology products 

proteins cytokines and enzymes extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest possible purity proteins including enzyme substrates and inhibitors are highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest biological activity 

antibodies antibodies are specialized proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that recognize and bind to target molecules the company’s polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats sheep and rabbits and purified from the animals’ blood monoclonal antibodies are derived from immortalized rodent cell lines and are isolated from cell culture medium 

immunoassays the immunoassay product line includes quantikine kits for the detection of human and animal proteins using 96well plates along with immunoassays on other testing platforms which allow researchers to quantify the amount of a specific analyte typically a cytokine adhesion molecule or an enzyme in a sample derived from any biological fluid 

clinical diagnostic immunoassay kits the company has received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for its erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic devices 

flow cytometry products this product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and kits which are used to determine the immunophenotypic properties of cells from different tissues 

intracellular cell signaling products this diverse product line provides reagents to elucidate cell signal transduction pathways within cells products include antibodies phosphospecific antibodies antibody arrays active caspases kinases and phosphatases and elisa assays to measure the activity of apoptotic and signaling molecules 

chemicallybased products these products include small natural or synthetic chemical compounds used by investigators as agonists antagonists andor inhibitors of various biological functions used in concert with other company products they provide additional tools to elucidate key pathways of cellular functions and can provide insight into the drug discovery process 

the company sells its biotechnology products directly to customers in north america most of western europe and to certain customers in china third party distributors are used in the remainder of china and europe and in the rest of the world 

hematology segment 

hematology controls and calibrators are products derived from various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patient’s blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments controls and calibrators ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and reliably 

  

blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of blood and blood cells which are suspended in the plasma there are three basic types of blood cells red cells white cells and platelets hemoglobin in red cells transports oxygen from the lungs throughout the body white cells are part of the body’s immune system platelets serve as a “plug” to stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a complex series of biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot 

these fundamental blood components red cells white cells and platelets differ widely in size and concentration as noted above hematology controls are used in automated and semiautomated cell counting analyzers to make sure these instruments are counting blood cells in patient samples accurately one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is a complete blood count cbc doctors use this rapid test in disease screening and diagnosis more than one billion of these tests are done worldwide every year the great majority with cell counting instruments in most laboratories the cbc consists of the white cell count the red cell count the hemoglobin reading and the hematocrit reading the percent of red cells in a volume of whole blood after it has been centrifuged also included in a cbc test is the differential which numbers and classifies the different types of white blood cells 

these and other characteristics or “parameters” of a blood sample can be measured by automated or semiautomated cell counters the number of parameters measurable in a blood control product depends on the type and sophistication of the instrument for which the control is designed ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately in addition most instruments need to be calibrated periodically hematology calibrators are similar to controls but undergo additional testing to ensure that the calibration values assigned are within tight specifications and can be used to calibrate the instrument 

the company offers a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters the company believes its products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors hematology control products are also supplied for use as proficiency testing tools by laboratory certifying authorities in a number of states and countries 

hematology products 

whole blood cbc controlscalibrators the company currently produces controls and calibrators for the following major brands of analyzers abbott diagnostics beckman coulter siemens healthcare diagnostics horiba medical and sysmex 

linearity and reportable range controls these products provide a means of assessing the linearity of hematology analyzers for white blood cells red blood cells platelets and reticulocytes immature red blood cells because hematology analyzers are singlepoint calibrated these products allow users to determine and validate the reportable range of an instrument 

whole blood reticulocyte controls these controls are designed for manual and automated counting of reticulocytes immature red blood cells 

whole blood flow cytometry controls these products act as controls for clinical flow cytometry instruments these instruments are used to identify and quantify white blood cells by their immunophenotypic properties 

whole blood glucosehemoglobin control this product is designed to monitor instruments which measure glucose and hemoglobin in whole blood 

erythrocyte sedimentation rate control this product is designed to monitor erythrocyte red blood cell sedimentation rate tests 

multipurpose platelet reference controls these products platelettrol ® ii and platelettrol extended are designed for use by automated and semiautomated analyzers which monitor platelet levels 

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for hematology controls and calibrators made by the company in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 oem agreements accounted for 87 million 80 million and 76 million respectively or 3 of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year the company sells directly to customers in the united states and through distributors in the rest of the world 

  

products under development 

the company is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its major product lines controls and calibrators hematology and cytokines antibodies assays and related products biotechnology the company believes that its future success depends to a large extent on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and markets at the same time the company continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality and maximum efficiency 

in fiscal 2011 the company introduced 1646 new biotechnology products the company is planning to release new proteins antibodies immunoassay products and chemicallybased research reagents in the coming year all of these products will be for research purposes only and therefore do not require fda clearance the company also developed several new hematology control products in fiscal 2011 and is continuously working on product improvements and enhancements however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace 

 

 investments 

the company has invested in the preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx ccx is a technology and drug development company working in the area of chemokines chemokines are cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of leukocytes the effector cells of the human immune system in conjunction with the investment and joint research efforts the company obtained exclusive worldwide research and diagnostic marketing rights to chemokine proteins antibodies and receptors discovered or developed by ccx the company holds a 166 ownership percentage in ccx the company has evaluated the cost versus equity method of accounting for its investment in ccx and determined that it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of ccx and therefore accounts for its investment on a cost basis the company’s net investment in ccx at both june 30 2011 and 2010 was 143 million 

the company has an 83 ownership percentage in hemerus medical llc hemerus hemerus was formed in march 2001 and has acquired and is developing technology for the separation of leukocytes from red blood cells and to extend the shelf life of the isolated blood products hemerus owns two patents has several patent applications pending and has received fda clearance to market its products in the us in parallel with this investment rd systems entered into a joint research agreement with hemerus the research involves joint projects to explore the use of hemerus’ filter technology to applications within rd systems’ hematology and biotechnology divisions such applications if any may have commercial potential in other laboratory environments the company accounts for its investment in hemerus under the equity method of accounting as hemerus is a limited liability company the company’s net investment in hemerus was 773000 and 12 million at june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

the company has a 168 ownership interest in nephromics llc nephromics nephromics has licensed technology related to the diagnosis of preeclampsia and has sublicensed the technology to several major diagnostic companies for the development of diagnostic assays in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 the company received distributions of 50000 and 13 million respectively from nephromics the company accounts for its investment in nephromics under the equity method of accounting as nephromics is a limited liability company its net investment in nephromics was 37 million and 40 million at june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

  

the company has a 136 ownership interest in actgen inc actgen a development stage biotechnology company located in japan actgen has intellectual property related to the identification and expression of secreted molecules the technology covers techniques to identify cellular molecules which are destined to be secreted into tissue fluids or shuttled to the cell membrane such molecules represent ideal targets as disease biomarkers the company’s net investment in actgen was 925000 and 11 million at june 30 2011 and 2010 respectively 

government regulation 

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended all of the company’s hematology control products are classified as “ in vitro diagnostic products” by the fda the entire hematology control manufacturing process from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their expiration date is strictly regulated and documented fda inspectors make periodic site inspections of the company’s hematology control operations and facilities hematology control manufacturing must comply with quality system regulations qsr as set forth in the fda’s regulations governing medical devices 

three of the company’s immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use the company must comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits biotechnology products manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do not require fda clearance 

some of the company’s research groups use small amounts of radioactive materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development activities thus the company is subject to regulation and inspection by the minnesota department of health and has been granted a license through august 2012 the license is renewable annually the company has had no difficulties in renewing this license in prior years and has no reason to believe it will not be renewed in the future if however the license was not renewed it would have minimal effect on the company’s business since there are other technologies the research groups could use to replace the use of radioisotopes 

both boston biochem and tocris products are used as research tools and require no regulatory approval for commercialization some of tocris’ products are considered controlled substances and require government permits to stock such products and to ship them to end users the company has no reason to believe that these annual permits will not be reissued 

availability of raw materials 

the primary raw material for the company’s hematology controls is whole blood human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks while porcine and bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants after raw blood is received it is separated into its components processed and stabilized although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on the company’s business the company does not perform its own pathogen testing as the supplier tests all human blood purchased rd systems’ biotechnology division develops and manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed inhouse thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources rd systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of products 

tocris sources its raw material from multiple worldwide sources many of the starting components used in the chemical synthesis are widely available common products and no single source of raw reagents poses a supply risk to this business 

  

patents and trademarks 

the company owns patent protection for certain hematology controls which extend for various periods depending on the date of the patent application or patent grant the company is not substantially dependent on products for which it has obtained patent protection revenues for such products are not material to the company’s financial results 

the company may seek patent protection for new or existing products it manufactures no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will be obtained no assurance can be given that the company’s products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others particularly for genetically engineered products the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products for more information on patent litigation see item 3 “legal proceedings” in this annual report on form 10k 

the company has a number of licensing agreements with patent holders under which it has the nonexclusive right to use patented technology or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented proteins and related products to the research market for fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 34 million 33 million and 32 million respectively 

the company has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its hematology controls and biotechnology product groups which extend for various periods depending upon the date of the trademark grant the company believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered 

seasonality of business 

biotechnology segment products marketed by the company historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months the company also usually experiences a slowing of sales in both of its reportable segments during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period the company believes this seasonality is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan and of academic schedules in the united states 

significant customers 

no single customer in either reportable segment accounted for more than 10 of the company’s consolidated net sales during fiscal 2011 2010 or 2009 

backlog 

there was no significant backlog of orders for the company’s products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2010 the majority of the company’s biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers’ orders the majority of hematology products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule 

competition 

the worldwide market for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents is being supplied by a number of companies including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences merck kgaaemd chemicals inc life technologies corporation millipore corporation peprotech inc santa cruz biotechnology inc abcam plc sigmaaldrich corporation thermo fisher scientific inc cayman chemical company and enzo biochem inc the company believes that it is one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research marketplace the company further believes that the expanding line of its products their recognized quality and the growing demand for protein related and chemicallybased research reagents will allow the company to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market 

  

competition is intense in the hematology control business the first control products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell counting historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made controls for use in their own instruments with rapid expansion of the instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled noninstrument manufacturers to gain a foothold today the market is comprised of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers the principal hematology control competitors for the company’s hematology retail products are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc streck inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation the company believes it is the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc

 item 1a risk factors 

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the company’s actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the company’s actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements 

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the company’s business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere any of the following risks or others discussed in this annual report on form 10k or the company’s other sec filings could materially adversely affect the company’s business operating results and financial condition 

the company’s future growth is dependent on the development of new products in a rapidly changing technological environment 

a major element of the company’s growth strategy is to increase revenues through new product releases as a result the company must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of customer needs new product development requires planning designing and testing at both technological and manufacturingprocess levels and may require significant research and development expenditures there can be no assurance that any products now in development or that the company may seek to develop in the future will achieve feasibility or gain market acceptance there can also be no assurance that the company’s competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company’s technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 

changes in economic conditions could negatively impact the company’s revenues and earnings 

the company’s biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions research and development spending by the company’s customers and the availability of government research funding can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions an economic downturn or a reduction or delay in governmental funding could cause customers to delay or forego purchases of the company’s products the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings 

the biotechnology and hematology industries are very competitive 

the company faces significant competition across all of its product line and in each market in which it operates competitors include companies ranging from startup companies who may be able to more quickly respond to customers’ needs to large multinational companies which may have greater financial and marketing resources than the company in addition consolidation trends in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have served to create fewer customer accounts andor to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers resulting in increased pricing pressure on the company the entry into the market of manufacturers in china and other lowcost manufacturing locations is also creating increased pricing pressures particularly in developing markets failure to anticipate and respond to competitors’ actions may impact the company’s future sales and earnings 

the company relies heavily on internal manufacturing and related operations to produce package and distribute its products 

the company manufactures the majority of the products it sells at its minneapolis facility quality control packaging and distribution operations support all of the company’s sales any significant disruption of these operations for any reason could adversely affect sales and customer relationships and therefore adversely affect the business while the company has taken certain steps to manage these operational risks and while insurance coverage may reimburse in whole or in part for losses related to such disruptions the company’s ability to provide products in the longer term could adversely affect future sales growth and earnings 

the design and manufacture of products involves certain inherent risks manufacturing or design defects could lead to recalls litigation or alerts relating to the company’s products a recall could result in significant costs and damage to the company’s reputation which could reduce demand for its products 

the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries which are subject to changes in exchange rates 

approximately 30 of the company’s sales are made through its foreign subsidiaries which make their sales in foreign currencies the company’s revenues and earnings are therefore affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates any adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates could negatively affect the company’s revenues and earnings 

the company may be unsuccessful in integrating boston biochem and tocris into its operations 

the actual financial results of boston biochem and tocris could differ from the company’s forecasts effecting the company’s future sales and net earnings if the integrations of the acquired businesses are not successful the company may record unexpected impairment charges factors that will affect the success of the acquisitions include any decrease in customer loyalty caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines or its sales and marketing practices including price increases the ability to retain key employees and the ability of the company to achieve synergies among its subsidiary companies such synergies include leveraging the combined companies’ sales and marketing efforts achieving certain cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products 

  

the company’s success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel 

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific production and management personnel are critical to the company’s success the company’s anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the company’s business 

the company’s business is subject to governmental laws and regulation 

the company’s operations are subject to regulation by various us federal state and international agencies laws and regulations enacted and enforced by these agencies impact all aspects of the company’s operations including design development manufacturing labeling selling and the importing and exporting of products across international borders any changes to laws and regulations governing such activities could have an effect on the company’s operations if the company fails to comply with any of these regulations it may become subject to fines penalties or actions that could impact development manufacturing and distribution andor increase costs or reduce sales the approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the company’s revenues 

as a multinational corporation the company is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of several international jurisdictions from time to time new tax legislation may be implemented which could adversely affect current or future tax filings or negatively impact the company’s effective tax rate and thus increase future tax payments 

the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights 

the company’s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and continues to negotiate licenses to produce a number of products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company 

the company is exposed to credit risk and fluctuations in the market values of its investment portfolio 

the company has investments in marketable debt securities that are classified and accounted for as availableforsale these securities include us government and agency securities foreign government and agency securities corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit these investments may experience reduced liquidity due to changes in market conditions and investor demand although the company has not recognized any significant losses to date on its availableforsale securities any significant future declines in their market values could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results given the global nature of its business the company has investments both domestically and internationally credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity credit deterioration or losses financial results or other factors as a result the value or liquidity of the company’s availableforsale investments could decline and result in a material impairment which could materially adversely affect the company’s financial condition and operating results 

the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in other companies the success of which is largely out of the company’s control 

the company’s expansion strategies include collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the company’s business and the acquisition of businesses for new products technologies and additional customer base these strategies carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected 

development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor fda clearance to market their products the company uses the equity method of accounting for certain of these investments and records a percentage of the losses of these companies as losses of the company the company may not have control of the expense levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those anticipated by the company additionally if funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations of these companies or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received by them the company may determine that its investment in one or more of these unconsolidated companies is “other than temporarily” impaired and the company could write off all or a portion of its investment

 item 3 legal proceedings 

in a previously disclosed lawsuit filed by streck inc streck venued in the us district court for the district of nebraska the nebraska court streck alleged patent infringement involving certain patents issued to streck relating to the addition of reticulocytes to hematology controls streck was seeking a royalty on sales of integrated hematology controls containing reticulocytes the company has reason to believe that rd systems and not streck first invented the inventions claimed in these patents and several other patents issued to streck as a result the company requested and in 2007 the us patent and trademark office uspto declared an interference to determine priority of invention between a patent application filed by rd systems and five streck patents including each of the patents involved in the lawsuit on november 2 2009 the interference board ordered that judgment for the company and against streck be entered finding that rd systems was the first to invent the integrated hematology controls containing reticulocytes 

the judgment if upheld by the federal circuit court of appeals will constitute cancellation of all claims of the five streck patents involving the addition of reticulocytes to hematology controls such cancellation may moot an earlier jury decision on october 28 2009 at the conclusion of trial in the nebraska court that the company did not meet its burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the streck patents were invalid the jury also found that a reasonable license royalty rate was 125 and that rd systems did not willfully infringe resulting in a judgment in favor of streck in the amount of approximately 170000 including court related costs on september 30 2010 the nebraska court upheld the jury verdict and in a related action reversed the ruling of the uspto interference board the nebraska court entered an injunction prohibiting the making and selling of the products that are the subject of the lawsuit but stayed a portion of the injunction to allow the company to sell inventory onhand through december 20 2010 in october 2010 the company appealed the adverse decisions of the nebraska court to the federal circuit court of appeals if the company’s appeal is successful after cancellation of the streck patents the company may be issued a patent covering integrated hematology controls containing reticulocytes the company does not believe the resolution of the above proceedings will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

contractual obligations 

the following table summarizes the company’s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of june 30 2011 in thousands 

 

 the above table does not include any reserves for income taxes as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of settlement of any reserve for income taxes 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

the company is not a party to any offbalance sheet transactions arrangements or obligations that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the company’s financial condition changes in the financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

critical accounting policies 

management’s discussion and analysis of the company’s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company’s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies 

valuation of availableforsale investments 

the company considers all of its marketable securities availableforsale and reports them at fair market value fair market values are based on quoted market prices unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments are excluded from income but are included net of taxes in other comprehensive income if an “otherthantemporary” impairment is determined to exist the difference between the value of the investment recorded in the financial statements and the company’s current estimate of fair value is recognized as a charge to earnings in the period in which the impairment is determined net unrealized gains on availableforsale investments at june 30 2011 were 10 million 

valuation of inventory 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or market the company regularly reviews inventory on hand for slowmoving and obsolete inventory inventory not meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration 

to meet strict customer quality standards the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies new protein and antibody products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met in addition the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale the manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies therefore has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a twoyear forecast the establishment of a twoyear forecast requires considerable judgment protein and antibody quantities in excess of the twoyear usage forecast are not valued due to uncertainty over salability the value of protein and antibody inventory not valued at june 30 2011 was 218 million 

the fair value of inventory purchased in fiscal 2011 through the acquisitions of boston biochem and tocris were determined based on quantities acquired selling prices at the date of acquisition and management’s assumptions regarding inventory having future value and the costs to sell such inventories at the acquisition dates the value of acquired inventory was increased 257 million for a total acquired inventory value of 330 million in addition the company acquired inventory that was not valued as part of the purchase price allocation as it was in excess of forecasted usage the increase in value of the acquired inventory remaining at june 30 2011 was 239 million 

  

valuation of intangible assets and goodwill 

when a business is acquired the purchase price is allocated as applicable between tangible assets identifiable intangible assets and goodwill determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets requires significant estimates the fair value of intangible assets acquired in fiscal 2011 including developed technologies trade names customer relationships and a noncompete agreement were based on management’s forecasted cash inflows and outflows using a relieffromroyalty and multiperiod excess earnings method with consideration to other factors including an independent valuation of management’s assumptions intangible assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 15 years the company reviews the carrying amount of intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were 523 million at june 30 2011 

goodwill recognized in connection with a business acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying amount of shared assets to the reporting units the company’s annual assessment included comparison of the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit including goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit a significant change in the company’s market capitalization or in the carrying amount of net assets of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge in future periods the company completed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and concluded that no impairment existed as of june 30 2011 as the fair values of the company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values with the exception of the tocris and boston biochem reporting units which were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 the carrying values of tocris and boston biochem approximate fair values at june 30 2011 goodwill at june 30 2011 was 866 million 

valuation of investments 

the company has made equity investments in several startup and early development stage companies among them chemocentryx inc ccx nephromics hemerus medical llc hemerus and actgen inc actgen the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity method is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to the company’s share in the equity of the investee and the company’s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee in determining which accounting treatment to apply the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment 

the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor us food and drug administration fda clearance to market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment the company’s net investments at june 30 2011 in ccx nephromics hemerus and actgen were 143 million 37 million 773000 and 925000 respectively 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201105 comprehensive income under an amendment to topic 220 under this update an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in both choices an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income asu no 201105 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity the update does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income the company must comply with asu no 201105 for the quarter ended september 30 2012 the company does not believe this update will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

in june 2009 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 167 now codified in asc topic 810 consolidation this statement amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities and was effective for the company beginning july 1 2010 the adoption of the statement did not have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures 

about market risk 

at the end of fiscal 2011 the company had a portfolio of fixed income securities excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents of 195 million see note c to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase the company’s investment policy requires all investment in shortterm and longterm securities to have at least debt ratings of a1 or a3 or the equivalent respectively as the company’s fixed income securities are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are recognized by the company in its consolidated statement of earnings due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity the company generally holds its fixed income securities until maturity and historically has not recorded any material gains or losses on any sale prior to maturity 

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates approximately 30 of consolidated net sales are made in foreign currencies including 15 in euro 7 in british pound sterling 3 in chinese yuan and the remaining 5 in other european currencies as a result the company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling and the chinese yuan as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the company’s foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation 

monthend exchange rates between the british pound sterling euro and chinese yuan and the us dollar which have not been weighted for actual sales volume in the applicable months in the periods were as follows 

 

   

the company’s exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises from trade receivables and intercompany payables denominated in one currency in the financial statements but receivable or payable in another currency at june 30 2011 the company had the following trade receivable and intercompany payables denominated in one currency but receivable or payable in another currency in thousands 

 

 all of the above balances are revolving in nature and are not deemed to be longterm balances 

the company does not enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate changes on forecasted intercompany sales transactions or on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in “other nonoperating expense net” in the consolidated statement of earnings the effect of translating net assets of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of “accumulated other comprehensive loss income” 

the effects of a hypothetical simultaneous 10 appreciation in the us dollar from june 30 2011 levels against the euro british pound sterling and chinese yuan are as follows in thousands

hematology segment net sales were 7 7 and 6 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively financial information relating to the companys operating segments is incorporated herein by reference to note l to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k biotechnology and rd europe segments the company through its biotechnology and rd europe segments is one of the worlds leading suppliers of cytokines and cytokinerelated reagents to the biotechnology research community these valuable proteins are produced in minute amounts by different types of cells and can be isolated from these cells or synthesized through recombinant dna technology currently nearly all of the companys cytokines are produced by recombinant dna technology the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues of the body cytokines are intercellular messengers they act as signals by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell tissue or organism for example cytokines can signal a cell to acquire the features necessary for it to take on a more specialized task another example of cytokine action is the key role played in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to grow and divide to attract migratory cells to the injury site and mediate the healing process the company also has enzymes and intracellular cell signaling reagents in its product portfolio enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate a variety of chemical reactions in cells most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins both enzymes and cytokines have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases including cancer alzheimers arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity aids and sars 1 the company markets cytokine immunoassay kits under the tradename quantikine these kits are used by researchers to quantify the level of a specific cytokine in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine cytokine quantification is an integral component of basic research as well as in the pharmaceutical discovery and development process the company currently manufactures and sells nearly 15000 biotechnology products biotechnology products cytokines and enzymes cytokines extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest possible purity enzymes and related factors including enzyme substrates and inhibitors are highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest biological activity antibodies antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that specifically recognize and bind to target molecules the companys polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats and sheep and purified from the animals blood monoclonal antibodies are made by immortalized cell lines derived from the antibody producing cells of a rodent monoclonal antibodies are secreted from these cell lines during cell culture production and purified from the cell culture medium assay kits this product line includes human and animal quantikine kits which allow research scientists to quantify the amount of a specific analyte cytokine adhesion molecule enzyme etc in a sample of serum or other biological fluids clinical diagnostic kits the company has received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for its erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic kits flow cytometry products this product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and fluorokine kits which are used to determine specific immunephenotypic properties of cells of the immune system by flow cytometric means intracellular cell signaling products this diverse product line provides reagents to elucidate cell signaling transduction pathways within cells products include antibodies phosphospecific antibodies antibody protein arrays active caspases kinases and phosphatases and elisa assays to quantitate and measure the activity of apoptotic and signaling molecules hematology segment hematology controls and calibrators are products composed of the various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patients blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments controls and calibrators ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and reliably blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of blood and blood cells which are suspended in the plasma there are three basic types of blood cells red cells white cells and platelets hemoglobin in red cells transports oxygen from the lungs throughout the body white cells are part of the bodys immune system platelets serve as a plug to stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a complex series of biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot 2 these fundamental blood components red cells white cells and platelets differ widely in size and concentration as noted above hematology controls are used in automated and semiautomated cell counting analyzers to make sure these instruments are counting blood cells in patient samples accurately one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is a complete blood count cbc doctors use this test in disease screening and diagnosis more than one billion of these tests are done worldwide every year the great majority with cell counting instruments in most laboratories the cbc consists of the white cell count the red cell count the hemoglobin reading and the hematocrit reading the percent of red cells in a volume of whole blood after it has been centrifuged also included in a cbc test is the differential which numbers and classifies the different types of white cells these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be measured by automated or semiautomated cell counters the number of parameters measurable in a blood control product depends on the type and sophistication of the instrument for which the control is designed ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately in addition most instruments need to be calibrated periodically hematology calibrators are similar to controls but undergo additional testing to ensure that the calibration values assigned are within tight specifications and can be used to calibrate the instrument the company offers a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters the company believes its products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors hematology control products are also supplied for use as proficiency testing materials by laboratory certifying authorities of a number of states and countries hematology products whole blood cbc controlscalibrators the company currently produces controls and calibrators for the following major brands of analyzers abbott diagnostics beckman coulter siemens healthcare diagnostics horiba medical and sysmex linearity and reportable range controls these products provide a means of assessing the linearity of hematology analyzers for white blood cells red blood cells platelets and reticulocytes immature red blood cells because hematology analyzers are singlepoint calibrated these products allow users to determine and validate the reportable range of an instrument whole blood reticulocyte controls these controls are designed for manual and automated counting of reticulocytes immature red blood cells whole blood flow cytometry controls these products are controls for clinical flow cytometry instruments these instruments are used to identify and quantify white blood cells by their immunophenotypic properties whole blood glucosehemoglobin control this product is designed to monitor instruments which measure glucose and hemoglobin in whole blood erythrocyte sedimentation rate control this product is designed to monitor erythrocyte red blood cell sedimentation rate tests multipurpose platelet reference controls these products platelettrol ii and platelettrol extended are designed for use by automated and semi automated analyzers which monitor platelet levels original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market for hematology controls and calibrators made by the company in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 oem agreements accounted for 80 million 76 million and 70 million respectively or 3 of total consolidated net sales in each fiscal year 3 products under development the company is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its major product lines controls and calibrators hematology and cytokines antibodies assays and related products biotechnology the company believes that its future success depends to a large extent on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and markets at the same time the company continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality and maximum efficiency in fiscal 2010 the company introduced over 1400 new biotechnology products the company is planning to release new cytokines antibodies and cytokine assay kits in the coming year all of these products will be for research purposes only and therefore do not require fda clearance the company also developed several new hematology control products in fiscal 2010 and is continuously working on product improvements and enhancements however there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and development phase can be successfully completed or if completed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace year ended june 30 2010 2009 2008

company has invested in the preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx ccx is a technology and drug development company working in the area of chemokines chemokines are cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of leukocytes the effector cells of the human immune system in conjunction with the investment and joint research efforts the company obtained exclusive worldwide research and diagnostic marketing rights to chemokine proteins antibodies and receptors discovered or developed by ccx the company holds a 168 ownership percentage in ccx the company has evaluated the cost versus equity method of accounting for its investment in ccx and determined that it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of ccx and therefore accounts for its investment on a cost basis the companys net investment in ccx at both june 30 2010 and 2009 was 143 million in fiscal 2004 the company purchased a 10 equity interest in hemerus medical llc hemerus for 30 million in fiscal years 2006 through 2008 the company invested an additional 18 million in hemerus increasing its ownership percentage to 19 in fiscal 2010 as a result of hemerus issuing additional ownership units the companys ownership percentage decreased to 138 as of june 30 2010 hemerus was formed in march 2001 and has acquired and is developing technology for the separation of leukocytes from red blood cells and to extend the shelf life of the isolated blood products hemerus owns two patents has several patent applications pending and has received fda clearance to market its products in the us in parallel with this investment rd systems entered into a joint research agreement with hemerus the research involves joint projects to explore the use of hemerus filter technology to applications within rd systems hematology and biotechnology divisions such applications if any may have commercial potential in other laboratory environments the company accounts for its investment in hemerus under the equity method of accounting as hemerus is a limited liability company the companys net investment in hemerus was 12 million and 22 million at june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively 4 in fiscal 2007 the company invested 72 million for an 18 equity interest in nephromics llc nephromics nephromics has licensed technology related to the diagnosis of preeclampsia and has sublicensed the technology to several major diagnostic companies for the development of diagnostic assays in fiscal 2008 nephromics issued additional membership units which reduced the companys ownership percentage to 168 in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 the company received distributions of 13 million and 50000 respectively from nephromics the company accounts for its investment in nephromics under the equity method of accounting as nephromics is a limited liability company its net investment in nephromics was 40 million and 45 million at june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively in fiscal 2008 the company invested 14 million in actgen inc actgen a development stage biotechnology company located in japan actgen has intellectual property related to the identification and expression of secreted molecules the technology covers techniques to identify cellular molecules which are destined to be secreted into tissue fluids or shuttled to the cell membrane such molecules represent an ideal target as disease biomarkers the company holds a 136 ownership percentage in actgen as of june 30 2010 the companys net investment in actgen was 11 million and 12 million at june 30 2010 and 2009 respectively government regulation all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended all of the companys hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products by the fda the entire hematology control manufacturing process from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their expiration date is strictly regulated and documented fda inspectors make periodic site inspections of the companys hematology control operations and facilities hematology control manufacturing must comply with quality system regulations qsr as set forth in the fdas regulations governing medical devices three of the companys immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use the company must comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits biotechnology products manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do not require fda clearance some of the companys research groups use small amounts of radioactive materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development activities thus the company is subject to regulation and inspection by the minnesota department of health and has been granted a license through august 2011 the license is renewable annually the company has had no difficulties in renewing this license in prior years and has no reason to believe it will not be renewed in the future if however the license was not renewed it would have minimal effect on the companys business since there are other technologies the research groups could use to replace the use of radioisotopes availability of raw materials the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole blood human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks while porcine and bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants after raw blood is received it is separated into its components processed and stabilized although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens the higher cost of these materials has not had a material adverse effect on the companys business the company does not perform its own pathogen testing as the supplier tests all human blood purchased rd systems biotechnology division develops and manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed inhouse thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources rd systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of products 5 patents and trademarks rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls which extend for various periods depending on the date of the patent application or patent grant the company is not substantially dependent on products for which it has obtained patent protection revenues for such products are not material to the companys financial results rd systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it manufactures no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will be obtained no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others particularly for genetically engineered products rd systems has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products for more information on patent litigation see item 3 legal proceedings in this annual report on form 10k rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to use patented technology or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine and cytokine related products to the research market for fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 33 million 32 million and 30 million respectively rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its hematology controls and biotechnology product groups which extend for various periods depending upon the date of the trademark grant rd systems believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered seasonality of business products marketed by rd systems and particularly rd europe historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months rd systems also usually experiences a slowing of sales during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period the company believes this slowing is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan and of academic schedules in the united states significant customers no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during fiscal 2010 2009 or 2008 backlog there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2009 the majority of the companys biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers orders the majority of hematology products are shipped based on a preset recurring schedule competition the worldwide market for cytokines and research diagnostic assay kits is being supplied by a number of biotechnology companies including ge healthcare life sciences bd biosciences emd biosciences inc life technologies corporation millipore corporation peprotech inc santa cruz biotechnology inc abcam plc sigmaaldrich corporation and thermo fisher scientific inc rd systems believes that it is one of the leading worldwide suppliers of cytokine related products in the research marketplace rd systems believes that the expanding line of its products their recognized quality and the growing demand for these rare and versatile proteins antibodies and assay kits will allow the company to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market 6 competition is intense in the hematology control business the first control products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell counting historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made controls for use in their own instruments with rapid expansion of the instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled non instrument manufacturers to gain a foothold today the market is comprised of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument manufacturers the principal hematology control competitors of rd systems retail products are abbott diagnostics beckman coulter inc biorad laboratories inc streck inc siemens healthcare diagnostics inc and sysmex corporation rd systems believes it is the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman coulter inc and streck inc employees through its subsidiaries the company employed 684 fulltime and

item 1a risk factors statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the companys business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition the companys revenues are significantly dependent on sales to research scientists in the private and public sector and a decrease in research spending could negatively impact the companys revenues the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions changes in spending on research by such companies and in the funding that such universities and institutions receive from government agencies including the national institutes of health affects the revenues and earnings of the company the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings the company operates in rapidly changing and intensely competitive industries and may not be able to keep pace with its competitors the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change while the hematology controls industry historically has been less subject to rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by changes in the automated testing equipment offered by instrument manufacturers competitors of the company are numerous and include among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical companies universities and other research institutions there can be no assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries and revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates approximately 29 of the companys sales are made through its foreign subsidiaries which make their sales in foreign currencies the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates any adverse movement in foreign currency rates could negatively affect the companys revenues and earnings the companys business is subject to governmental regulation which may have the effect of delaying or impeding the release of certain of its products ongoing research and development activities and the production and marketing of certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries the approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the companys revenues 9 the company is dependent on maintaining its intellectual property rights and cannot guarantee that it will not be subject to intellectual property litigation in the future the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company the companys success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel the loss of whom could adversely affect its operations recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical to the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the companys business the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in other companies the success of which is largely out of the companys control the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of new products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys business and the acquisition of companies for new products technologies and additional customer base carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor fda clearance to market their products the company uses the equity method of accounting for certain of these investments and records a percentage of the losses of these companies as losses of the company the company may not have control of the expense levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those anticipated by the company additionally if funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations of these companies or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received by them the company may determine that its investment in one or more of these unconsolidated companies is other than temporarily impaired and the company could write off all or a portion of its investment the company may be unsuccessful in expanding into china and establishing adequate distribution channels for its products in china the company established a subsidiary in china in late fiscal 2007 to provide warehousing marketing sales and technical services for the growing chinese market the companys ability to recover its investment is dependent upon its ability to retain current thirdparty distributors in china and expand its market share in the region 10

hematology segment net sales were 7 6 and 7 of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively financial information relating to the companys operating segments is incorporated herein by reference to note l to the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k biotechnology and rd europe segments the company through its biotechnology and rd europe segments is the worlds leading supplier of cytokines and cytokinerelated reagents to the biotechnology research community these valuable proteins are produced in minute amounts by different types of cells and can be isolated from these cells or synthesized through recombinant dna technology currently nearly all of the companys cytokines are produced by recombinant dna technology the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines is largely due to the profound effect that a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on cells and tissues of the body cytokines are intercellular messengers they act as signals by interacting with specific receptors on the affected cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell tissue or organism for example cytokines can signal a cell to acquire the features necessary for it to take on a more specialized task another example of cytokine action is the key role played in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to grow and divide to attract migratory cells to the injury site and mediate the healing process the company also has enzymes and intracellular cell signaling reagents in its product portfolio enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate a variety of chemical reactions in cells most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins many enzymes have the potential to serve as predictive biomarkers and therapeutic targets for a variety of diseases including cancer alzheimers arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity aids and sars 3 the company markets cytokine assay kits under the tradename quantikine these kits are used by researchers to quantify the level of a specific cytokine in biological fluids such as serum plasma or urine cytokine quantification is an integral component of basic research as well as in the pharmaceutical discovery and development process the company currently manufactures and sells nearly 14000 biotechnology products biotechnology products cytokines and enzymes cytokines extracted from natural sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest purity enzymes and related factors including enzyme substrates and inhibitors are highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest biological activity antibodies antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system of an animal that specifically recognize and bind to target molecules the companys polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats and sheep and purified from the animals blood monoclonal antibodies are made by immortalized cell lines derived from the antibody producing cells of a rodent monoclonal antibodies are secreted from these cell lines during cell culture and purified from the cell culture medium assay kits this product line includes human and animal quantikine kits which allow research scientists to quantify the amount of a specific analyte cytokine adhesion molecule enzyme etc in a sample of serum or other biological fluids clinical diagnostic kits the company has received food and drug administration fda marketing clearance for its erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin immunoassays for use as in vitro diagnostic kits flow cytometry products this product line includes fluorochrome labeled antibodies and fluorokine kits which are used to measure the presence or absence of cell surface receptors for specific cytokines by flow cytometry intracellular cell signaling products this diverse product line provides reagents to study apoptosis programmed cell death and to elucidate signal transduction pathways within cells products include antibodies phosphospecific antibodies antibody protein arrays active caspases kinases and phosphatases and elisa assays to quantitate and measure the activity of apoptotic and signaling molecules hematology segment hematology controls and calibrators are products composed of the various cellular components of blood which have been stabilized proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patients blood cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments controls and calibrators ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and reliably blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of which is mainly water and blood cells which are suspended in the plasma there are three basic types of blood cells red cells white cells and platelets hemoglobin in red cells transports oxygen from the lungs throughout the body white cells defend the body against foreign invaders platelets serve as a plug to stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a complex series of biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot these fundamental blood components red cells white cells and platelets differ widely in size and concentration as noted above hematology controls are used in automated and semiautomated cell counting analyzers to make sure these instruments are counting blood cells in patient samples accurately one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is a complete blood count cbc doctors use this test in disease screening and diagnosis more than one billion of these tests are done worldwide every year the great majority with cell counting instruments in most laboratories the cbc consists of the white cell count the red cell count the hemoglobin reading and the hematocrit reading the percent of red cells in a volume of whole blood after it has been centrifuged also included in a cbc test is the differential which numbers and classifies the different types of white cells 4 these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be measured by automated or semiautomated cell counters the number of parameters measurable in a blood control product depends on the type and sophistication of the instrument for which the control is designed ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately in addition most instruments need to be calibrated periodically hematology calibrators are similar to controls but go through additional testing to ensure that the calibration values assigned are within tight specifications and can be used to calibrate the instrument the company offers a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters the company believes its products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors hematology control products are also supplied for use as proficiency testing materials by laboratory certifying authorities of a number of states and countries hematology products whole blood cbc controlscalibrators the company currently produces controls and calibrators for the following major brands of analyzers abbott diagnostics beckman coulter siemens healthcare diagnostics horiba medical and sysmex linearity and reportable range controls these products provide a means of assessing the linearity of hematology analyzers for white blood cells red blood cells platelets and reticulocytes immature red blood cells because hematology analyzers are singlepoint calibrated these products allow users to determine and validate the reportable range of an instrument whole blood reticulocyte controls these controls are designed for manual and automated counting of reticulocytes immature red blood cells whole blood flow cytometry controls these products are controls for flow cytometry instruments these instruments are used to identify and quantify white blood cells by their surface markers whole blood glucosehemoglobin control this product is designed to monitor instruments which measure glucose and hemoglobin in whole blood

effector cells of the human immune system in conjunction with the investment and joint research efforts the company obtained exclusive worldwide research and diagnostic marketing rights to chemokine proteins antibodies and receptors discovered or developed by ccx the company holds a 168 ownership percentage in ccx the company has evaluated the cost versus equity method of accounting for its investment in ccx and determined that it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of ccx and therefore accounts for its investment on a cost basis the companys net investment in ccx at both june 30 2009 and 2008 was 143 million in fiscal 2004 the company purchased a 10 interest in hemerus medical llc hemerus for 30 million in fiscal years 2006 through 2008 the company invested an additional 18 million in hemerus increasing its ownership percentage to 19 in fiscal 2009 as a result of hemerus repurchasing and retiring a third partys membership units the companys ownership percentage increased to 22 hemerus was formed in march 2001 and has acquired and is developing technology for the separation of leukocytes from blood and blood components hemerus owns two patents has several patent applications pending and has received fda clearance to market its products in the us in parallel with this investment rd systems entered into a joint research agreement with hemerus the research involves joint projects to explore the use of hemerus filter technology to applications within rd systems hematology and biotechnology divisions such applications if any may have commercial potential in other laboratory environments the company accounts for its investment in hemerus under the equity method of accounting as hemerus is a limited liability company the companys net investment in hemerus was 22 million and 29 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively in fiscal 2007 the company invested 72 million for an 18 equity interest in nephromics llc nephromics nephromics has licensed technology related to the diagnosis of preeclampsia and has sublicensed the technology to several major diagnostic companies for the development of diagnostic assays in fiscal 2008 nephromics issued additional membership units which reduced the companys ownership percentage to 168 in fiscal 2009 the company received a 13 million distribution from nephromics the company accounts for its investment in nephromics under the equity method of accounting as nephromics is a limited liability company its net investment in nephromics was 45 million and 62 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively in fiscal 2008 the company invested 14 million for a 19 interest in actgen a development stage biotechnology company located in japan actgen has intellectual property related to the identification and expression of molecules the technology covers techniques to identify cellular molecules which are destined to be secreted into tissue fluids or shuttled to the cell membrane such molecules represent an ideal target as disease biomarkers the companys net investment in actgen was 12 million and 13 million at june 30 2009 and 2008 respectively 6 government regulation all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended all of the companys hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products by the fda the entire hematology control manufacturing process from receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their expiration date is strictly regulated and documented fda inspectors make periodic site inspections of the companys hematology control operations and facilities hematology control manufacturing must comply with quality system regulations qsr as set forth in the fdas regulations governing medical devices three of the companys immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use the company must comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits biotechnology products manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do not require fda clearance some of the companys research groups use small amounts of radioactive materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development activities thus the company is subject to regulation and inspection by the minnesota department of health and has been granted a license through august 2010 the license is renewable annually the company has had no difficulties in renewing this license in prior years and has no reason to believe it will not be renewed in the future if however the license was not renewed it would have minimal effect on the companys business since there are other technologies the research groups could use to replace the use of radioisotopes availability of raw materials the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole blood human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks while porcine and bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants after raw blood is received it is separated into its components processed and stabilized although the cost of human blood has increased due to the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases and pathogens the higher cost of these materials has not had a serious adverse effect on the companys business the company does not perform its own pathogen testing as the supplier tests all human blood purchased rd systems biotechnology division develops and manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed inhouse thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources rd systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the manufacture of products patents and trademarks rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls which extend for various periods depending on the date of the patent application or patent grant rd systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it manufactures no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will be obtained no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others particularly for genetically engineered products rd systems has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products see item 3 legal proceedings in this annual report on form 10k rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to use patented technology or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine and cytokine related products to the research market for fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 32 million 30 million and 26 million respectively rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its hematology controls and biotechnology product groups which extend for various periods depending upon the date of the trademark grant rd systems believes it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those which it has registered 7 seasonality of business products marketed by rd systems and particularly rd europe historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the summer months rd systems also usually experiences a slowing of sales during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period the company believes this slowing is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan and of academic schedules in the united states significant customers no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during fiscal 2009 2008 or 2007 backlog there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of the date of this annual report on form 10k or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2008 the majority of the companys biotechnology products are shipped within one day of receipt of the customers orders the majority of

item 1a risk factors statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed below the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluation of the companys business and any forwardlooking statements made in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere any of the following risks could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial condition the companys revenues are significantly dependent on sales to research scientists in the private and public sector and a decrease in research spending could negatively impact the companys revenues the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government research institutions changes in spending on research by such companies and in the funding that such universities and institutions receive from government agencies including the national institutes of health affects the revenues and earnings of the company the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings the company operates in rapidly changing and intensely competitive industries and may not be able to keep pace with its competitors the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change while the hematology controls industry historically has been less subject to rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by changes in the automated testing equipment offered by instrument manufacturers competitors of the company are numerous and include among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical companies universities and other research institutions there can be no assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive the company is significantly dependent on sales made through foreign subsidiaries and revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted by changes in exchange rates approximately 29 of the companys sales are made through its foreign subsidiaries which make their sales in foreign currencies the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates any adverse movement in foreign currency rates could negatively affect the companys revenues and earnings the companys business is subject to governmental regulation which may have the effect of delaying or impeding the release of certain of its products ongoing research and development activities and the production and marketing of certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries the approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company and negatively affect the companys revenues 10 the company is dependent on maintaining our intellectual property rights and cannot guarantee that it will not be subject to intellectual property litigation in the future the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the company the companys success will be dependent on recruiting and retaining highly qualified personnel the loss of whom could adversely affect its operations recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical to the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could adversely affect the companys business the company may incur losses as a result of its investments in other companies the success of which is largely out of the companys control the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of new products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys business and the acquisition of companies for new products technologies and additional customer base carry risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor fda clearance to market their products the company uses the equity method of accounting for certain of these investments and records a percentage of the losses of these companies as losses of the company the company may not have control of the expense levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those anticipated by the company additionally if funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations of these companies or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received by them the company may determine that its investment in one or more of these unconsolidated companies is other than temporarily impaired and the company could write off all or a portion of its investment the company may be unsuccessful in expanding into china and establishing adequate distribution channels for our products in china the company established a subsidiary in china in late fiscal 2007 to provide warehousing marketing sales and technical services for the growing chinese market the companys ability to recover its investment is dependent upon its ability to retain current thirdparty distributors in china and expand its market share in the region 11

critical accounting policies managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or

control standards and inventory subject to expiration 20 to meet strict customer quality standards the company has established a highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies new protein and antibody products require the initial manufacture of multiple batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met in addition the company will produce larger batches of established products than current sales requirements due to economies of scale the manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies therefore has and will continue to produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage the company values its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a twoyear forecast the establishment of a twoyear forecast requires considerable judgment protein and antibody quantities in excess of the twoyear usage forecast are considered impaired and not included in the inventory value the value of protein and antibody inventory reserved at june 30 2009 was 177 million valuation of goodwill the company is required to perform an annual review for impairment of goodwill in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill

treatment to apply the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the investment the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor us food and drug administration fda clearance to market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment the companys net investments at june 30 2009 in ccx hemerus nephromics and actgen were 143 million 22 million 45 million and 12 million respectively recent accounting pronouncements in june 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 168 the fasb accounting standards codification and the

consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 to require revised evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities ongoing assessments of control over such entities and additional disclosures for variable interests the company believes the adoption of this pronouncement will not have an impact on the companys consolidated financial statements in february 2008 the fasb amended sfas no 157 fair value measurements to defer the effective date of sfas no 157 for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis as disclosed in note a to the consolidated financial statements following the company partially adopted the provisions of sfas no 157 effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 the company expects to adopt the remaining provisions of sfas no 157 beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 157 related to other nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statement disclosures market risk at the end of fiscal 2009 the company had an independently managed investment portfolio of fixed income securities excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents of 1038 million see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase however because the companys fixed income securities are classified as availableforsale no gains or losses are recognized by the company in its consolidated statement of earnings due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity the company generally holds its fixed income securities until maturity and historically has not recorded any material gains or losses on any sale prior to maturity the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rates approximately 29 of consolidated net sales are made in foreign currencies including 15 in euro 6 in british pound sterling 2 in chinese yuan and the remaining 6 in other european currencies as a result the company is exposed to market risk mainly from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro british pound sterling and the chinese yuan as compared to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the companys foreign operations are translated into us dollars for consolidation exchange rates between the british pound sterling euro and chinese yuan and the us dollar were as follows based on monthend ratios year ended june 30 2009 2008 2007    british pound high  198  208  200 low 143 198 187

                            item 1  business

overview

techne corporation the company is a holding company which has two wholly
owned operating subsidiaries  research and diagnostic systems inc rd
systems located in minneapolis minnesota and rd systems europe ltd rd
europe located in abingdon england  rd systems is a specialty
manufacturer of biological products  its two major operating segments are
hematology controls which are used in hospital and clinical laboratories to
check the performance of blood analysis instruments and biotechnology
products including purified proteins cytokines and antibodies which are
sold exclusively to the research market and assay kits which are sold to the
research and clinical diagnostic markets  rd systems acquired two
subsidiaries effective july 1 2005  fortron bio science inc fortron and
biospacific inc biospacific  rd europe distributes rd systems
biotechnology products in europe  rd europe has a german sales subsidiary
rd systems gmbh rd gmbh and a sales office in france

in july 2005 the company acquired fortron bio science inc and biospacific
inc fortron a developer and manufacturer of monoclonal and polyclonal
antibodies antigens and other biological reagents  was relocated to the
companys minneapolis facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2006
biospacific located in emeryville california is a worldwide supplier of
biologics to manufacturers of in vitro diagnostic systems ivds and
immunodiagnostic kits biospacific is the primary distributor of fortron
products fortron and biospacific had shared a unique strategic relationship
since 1992 that combined fortrons development and manufacturing excellence
with biospacifics marketing and sales expertise  the acquisitions allow the
company to expand into the diagnostic market by offering research reagents
that may have future diagnostic applications andor develope products
specifically for diagnostic markets


the market

the company manufactures and sells products for the clinical diagnostics
market hematology controls and calibrators and the biotechnology research
and clinical diagnostics market cytokines assays and related products  in
fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 hematology segment revenues accounted for
approximately 8 9 and 11 respectively of consolidated revenues
revenues from the companys biotechnology segment were 66 62 and 62 and
revenues from rd europe were 26 29 and 27 of consolidated revenues for
fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively


                      biotechnology products

rd systems is the worlds leading supplier of cytokines and cytokinerelated
reagents to the biotechnology research community  these valuable proteins
exist in minute amounts in different types of cells and can be extracted from
these cells or made through recombinant dna technology   currently nearly
all of the companys cytokines are produced by recombinant dna technology

the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines
exists because of the profound effect a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on
the cells and tissues of the body  cytokines are intercellular messengers
they act as signals by interacting with specific receptors on the affected
cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell
tissue or organism  for example cytokines can signal a cell to
differentiate ie to acquire the features necessary for it to take on a
more specialized task  another example of cytokine action is the key role
played in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to grow and divide to
attract migratory cells to the injury site and mediate the healing process

                                   3

in recent years rd systems has also added enzymes and intracellular cell
signaling reagents to its product portfolio   enzymes are biological
catalysts that accelerate a variety of chemical reactions in cells  most
enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are proteins that
modify the structure and function of other proteins  many enzymes are
important markers and therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer
alzheimers arthritis autoimmunity diabetes hypertension obesity aids
and sars

rd systems markets cytokine assay kits under the tradename quantikiner
these kits are used by scientific researchers to quantify the level of a
specific cytokine in a sample of serum plasma or other biological fluid
cytokine quantification is performed for basic research and in pharmaceutical
discovery and development programs

rd systems currently manufactures and sells in excess of 10000
biotechnology products

biotechnology products

cytokines and enzymes  cytokines extracted from natural sources or
produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest
purity  enzymes and related factors including enzyme substrates and
inhibitors are highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest
biological activity

antibodies  antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system of an
animal that specifically recognize and bind to target molecules  the
companys polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats
and purified from the animals blood  monoclonal antibodies are made by
immortalized cell lines derived from the individual antibody producing
cells of a rodent  monoclonal antibodies are secreted from these cell
lines during cell culture and purified from the cell culture medium

assay kits  this product line includes rd systems human and animal
quantikine kits which allow research scientists to quantify the amount of
a specific analyte cytokine adhesion molecule enzyme etc in a sample
of serum or other biological fluids

clinical diagnostic kits    rd systems has received fda marketing
clearance for its erythropoietin epo transferrin receptor tfr and
beta2microglobulin diagnostic kits

flow cytometry products  this product line includes rd systems labeled
antibodies and fluorokiner kits which are used to measure the presence
or absence of cell surface receptors for specific cytokines by flow
cytometry

intracellular cell signaling products  this diverse product line provides
reagents to study apoptosis programmed cell death and to elucidate
signal transduction pathways  products include antibodies phospho
specific antibodies antibody protein arrays active caspases kinases
and phosphatases and elisa assays to quantitate and measure the activity
of apoptotic and signaling molecules



                hematology controls and calibrators

hematology controls and calibrators manufactured and marketed by rd
systems are products composed of the various cellular components of blood
which have been stabilized  proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a
thorough and accurate analysis of a patients blood cells which is usually
done with automated or semiautomated hematology instruments  controls and
calibrators produced by rd systems ensure that these instruments are
performing accurately and reliably

blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of which is mainly water and
blood cells which are suspended in the plasma  there are three basic types
of blood cells  red cells white cells and platelets   hemoglobin in red
cells transports oxygen from the lungs throughout the body  white cells
defend the body against foreign invaders  platelets serve as a plug to
stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a complex series of
biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot

                                    4

these fundamental blood components red cells white cells and platelets
differ widely in size and concentration  as noted above hematology controls
are used in automated and semiautomated cell counting analyzers to make sure
these instruments are counting blood cells in patient samples accurately
one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is a
complete blood count or cbc  doctors use this test in disease screening and
diagnosis  more than one billion of these tests are done worldwide every
year the great majority with cell counting instruments  in most
laboratories the cbc consists of the white cell count the red cell count
the hemoglobin reading and the hematocrit reading the percent of red cells
in a volume of whole blood after it has been centrifuged  also included in
a cbc test is the differential which numbers and classifies the different
types of white cells

these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be
measured by automated or semiautomated cell counters  the number of
parameters measurable in a blood control product depends on the type and
sophistication of the instrument for which the control is designed
ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make
sure the instrument is reading accurately  in addition most instruments
need to be calibrated periodically  hematology calibrators are similar to
controls but go through additional testing to ensure that the calibration
values assigned are extremely accurate and can be used to calibrate the
instrument

rd systems offers a wide range of hematology controls and calibrators for
both impedance and laser type cell counters  rd systems believes its
products have improved stability and versatility and a longer shelf life than
most of those of its competitors  hematology control products are also
supplied for use as proficiency testing materials by laboratory certifying
authorities of a number of states and countries

hematology products

whole blood cbc controlscalibrators  rd systems currently produces
controls and calibrators for the following major brands of analyzers
abbott diagnostics beckman coulter bayer technicon abx and sysmex

linearity and reportable range controls  these products provide a means
of assessing the linearity of hematology analyzers for white blood cells
red blood cells platelets and reticulocytes immature red blood cells
because hematology analyzers are singlepoint calibrated these products
allow users to determine and validate the reportable range of an
instrument

whole blood reticulocyte controls  these controls are designed for manual
and automated counting of reticulocytes immature red blood cells

whole blood flow cytometry controls  these products are controls for flow
cytometry instruments  these instruments are used to identify and
quantify white blood cells by their surface markers

whole blood glucosehemoglobin control  this product is designed to
monitor instruments which measure glucose and hemoglobin in whole blood

erythrocyte sedimentation rate control  this product is designed to
monitor erythrocyte red blood cell sedimentation rate tests

multipurpose platelet reference controls  these products platelettrolr
ii and platelettrol extended are designed for use by automated and semi
automated analyzers which monitor platelet levels

products under development

rd systems is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its
major product lines  controls and calibrators hematology and cytokines
antibodies assays and related products biotechnology  the company
believes that its future success depends to a large extent on its ability
to keep pace with changing technologies and markets  at the same time the
company continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality
and maximum efficiency

rd systems is planning to release new cytokines antibodies and cytokine
assay kits in the coming year  all of these products will be for research
purposes only and therefore do not require fda clearance  rd systems
developed several new hematology control products in fiscal 2006 and is
continuously working on product improvements and enhancements  however
there is no assurance that any of the products in the research and
development phase can be developed or if developed can be successfully
introduced into the marketplace

in january 2004 the company purchased a 10 interest in hemerus medical llc
hemerus for 30 million in march 2006 the company invested an additional
750000 in hemerus increasing its ownership percentage to 15  hemerus was
formed in march 2001 and has acquired and is developing technology for the
separation of leukocytes from blood and blood components leukoreduced blood
is important in blood transfusion hemerus owns two patents and has several
patent applications pending and is currently pursuing fda clearance to market
its products in the us in parallel with this investment rd systems
entered into a joint research agreement with hemerus the research will
involve joint projects to explore the use of hemerus filter technology to
applications within rd systems hematology and biotechnology divisions such
applications if any may have commercial potential in other laboratory
environments the company accounts for its investment in hemerus under the
equity method of accounting as it is a limited liability corporation  the
companys net investment in hemerus was 30 million and 26 million at june
30 2006 and 2005 respectively

in fiscal 2002 the company made an equity investment of 30 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi of minneapolis minnesota  dgi held licenses from the university of
minnesota to develop technologies used for functional genomics and the
discovery of drugable targets  the company currently holds a 38 equity
interest in dgi and warrants to acquire an additional 15 million shares at
250 per share which expire in august 2008  the company also received the
rights to develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins discovered by
dgi and an exclusive royaltyfree license to sell such products in the
research market  the companys investment was accounted for under the equity
method of accounting  during fiscal 2004 the company determined that its
investment in dgi was other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the
remaining net investment of 15 million

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market
for hematology controls and calibrators made by rd systems  in fiscal 2006
2005 and 2004 oem contracts accounted for 58 million 68 million and
77 million respectively or 3 4 and 5 of total consolidated net sales


government regulation

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under
the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended  all of rd systems
hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products
by the fda  the entire hematology control manufacturing process from
receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their
expiration date is strictly regulated and documented  fda inspectors make
periodic site inspections of the rd systems hematology control operations
and facilities  hematology control manufacturing must comply with quality
system regulations qsr as set forth in the fdas regulations governing
medical devices

three of rd systems immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin
have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use  rd systems must
comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits  biotechnology products
manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do
not require fda clearance

some of rd systems research groups use small amounts of radioactive
materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development
activities  thus rd systems is subject to regulation by the us nuclear
regulatory commission nrc and has been granted an nrc license due to expire
in april 2007  the license is renewable annually  rd systems is also
subject to regulation and inspection by the department of health of the state
of minnesota for its use of radioactive materials  it has been granted a
certificate of registration which is renewable annually by the minnesota
department of health  the current certificate expires april 1 2007  rd
systems has had no difficulties in renewing these licenses in prior years and
has no reason to believe they will not be renewed in the future  if
however the licenses were not renewed it would have minimal effect on rd
systems business since there are other technologies the research groups
could use to replace the use of radioisotopes

availability of raw materials

the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole
blood  human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks while porcine
and bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants  after raw
blood is received it is separated into its components processed and
stabilized  although the cost of human blood has increased owing largely to
the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases the higher cost of
these materials has not had a serious adverse effect on the companys
business  rd systems does not perform its own testing as the supplier tests
all human blood purchased  rd systems biotechnology division develops and
manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed in
house thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources  rd
systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials
necessary for the manufacture of products


patents and trademarks

rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls  rd
systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it
manufactures  no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will
be obtained  no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not
infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others
particularly for genetically engineered products rd systems has not
conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products  see item 3
legal proceedings below

rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent
holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to patented technology
or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine
and cytokine related products to the research market  for fiscal 2006 2005
and 2004 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately
26 million 26 million and 23 million respectively

rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its
hematology controls and biotechnology product groups  rd systems believes
it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those
which it has registered


seasonality of business

sales of products by rd systems and particularly rd europe historically
experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth during the
summer months  rd systems also usually experiences a slowing of sales
during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period  the company believes
this slowing is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan and of
academic schedules in the united states


significant customers

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during
fiscal 2006 2005 or 2004


backlog

there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of
the date of this report or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2005  the
majority of the companys biotechnology products are shipped within one day
of receipt of the customers order  the majority of hematology products are
shipped based on a preset recurring schedule

competition

the worldwide market for cytokines and research diagnostic assay kits is
being supplied by a number of biotechnology companies including bd
biosciences invitrogen corporations biosource division peprotech inc
sigma chemical co amersham biosciences fisher scientific millipore corp
and emd biosciences inc  rd systems believes that it is the leading
worldwide supplier of cytokine related products in the research marketplace
rd systems believes that the expanding line of its products their
recognized quality and the growing demand for these rare and versatile
proteins antibodies and assay kits will allow the company to remain
competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market

competition is intense in the hematology control business  the first control
products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic
instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell
counting  historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made
controls for use in their own instruments  with rapid expansion of the
instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled non
instrument manufacturers to gain a foothold  today the market is comprised
of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products
and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument
manufacturers  the principal hematology control competitors of rd systems
retail products are beckman coulter inc sysmex streck laboratories
abbott diagnostics biorad laboratories and bayer technicon  rd systems
believes it is the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the
marketplace behind beckman coulter and streck laboratories

                           item 1a  risk factors


forwardlooking statements

statements in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere that are
forwardlooking involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the
companys actual results of operations certain of these risks and
uncertainties which have affected and in the future could affect the
companys actual results are discussed below  the company undertakes no
obligation to update or revise any forwardlooking statements made due to new
information or future events investors are cautioned not to place undue
emphasis on these statements


risk factors

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with
evaluation of the companys business and any forwardlooking statements made
in this annual report on form 10k and elsewhere  any of the following risks
could materially adversely affect the companys business operating results
and financial condition

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research
scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university
and government research institutions changes in spending on research by such
companies and in funding of such universities and institutions by government
including the national institutes of health affects the revenues and
earnings of the company the company carries essentially no backlog of orders
and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause
fluctuations in quarterly net sales and earnings

approximately one quarter of the companys net sales are made through its
european subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign
currencies the companys net sales and earnings are therefore affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change while the hematology controls industry historically has been less
subject to rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by instrument
manufacturers competitors of the company are numerous and include among
others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument and
equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical
companies universities and other research institutions there can be no
assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in developing
technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or
are being developed by the company or that would render the companys
technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive

                                  10

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is negotiating
licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products claimed to be
owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement
study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company
may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may
have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain
activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing
additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse
effect on the company

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of new
products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies
developing new products related to the companys business and the
acquisition of companies for new products and additional customer base carry
risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be
adversely affected under the equity method of accounting a percentage of
the losses of certain companies in which the company invests will be reported
as losses of the company the company may not have control of the expense
levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those
anticipated by the company additionally if the company determines that its
investment in such companies is other than temporarily impaired the
company may write off its entire investment in such company

ongoing research and development activities and the production and marketing
of certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by numerous
governmental authorities in the united states and other countries the
approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that
may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining
approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by
the company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical
to the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will
require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional
expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such
personnel could adversely affect the companys business

offbalance sheet arrangements

the company is not a party to any offbalance sheet transactions
arrangements or obligations that have or are reasonably likely to have a
material effect on the companys financial condition changes in the
financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity
capital expenditures or capital resources

critical accounting policies

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition
and results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing
basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its
business operations and an understanding of results of operations the
listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting
policies

valuation of accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment
history and the customers current creditworthiness as determined by
managements review of their current credit information the company
continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and
maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the companys
historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have
been identified while such credit losses have historically been within the
companys established provisions if the financial condition of the companys
customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments additional allowances may be required gross trade receivables
totaled 239 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was 120000 at
june 30 2006

valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost
firstin firstout method or market the company regularly reviews
inventory on hand for slowmoving and obsolete inventory inventory not
meeting quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration

to meet strict customer quality standards the company has established a
highly controlled manufacturing process for proteins and antibodies new
protein and antibody products require the initial manufacture of multiple
batches to determine if quality standards can be consistently met in
addition the company will produce larger batches of established products
than current sales requirements due to economies of scale the manufacturing
process for proteins and antibodies therefore has and will continue to
produce quantities in excess of forecasted usage the company values its
manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a twoyear forecast
protein and antibody quantities in excess of the twoyear usage forecast are
considered impaired and not included in the inventory value through
march 31 2006 due to changes in the companys forecast reserves for
previously written off inventories may have been reversed in subsequent
periods inventory reserves reversed through march 31 2006 were not material
to the companys consolidated results of operations consolidated financial
position assets or stockholders equity as of and for each of the periods
presented subsequent to march 31 2006 the company changed its policy and
no longer writes up previously unvalued inventories this change in valuation
method did not have a material impact on the companys fiscal 2006
consolidated financial statements the value of protein and antibody
inventory reserved at june 30 2006 was 117 million

                                   20

valuation of goodwill the company is required to perform an annual review
for impairment of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial
accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill
is considered to be impaired if it is determined that the carrying value of
the reporting unit exceeds its fair value assessing the impairment of
goodwill requires the company to make judgments regarding the fair value of
the net assets of its reporting units and the allocation of the carrying
value of shared assets to the reporting units the companys annual
assessment included comparison of the carrying value of the net assets of the
companys biotechnology operations to its share of the companys market
capitalization at june 30 2006 a significant change in the companys market
capitalization or in the carrying value of net assets of the biotechnology
operations could result in an impairment charge in future periods goodwill
at june 30 2006 was 253 million

valuation of intangible and other longlived assets the company
periodically assesses the impairment of intangible and other longlived
assets which requires it to make assumptions and judgments regarding the
fair value of these asset groups asset groups are considered to be impaired
if their carrying value exceeds the asset groups ability to continue to
generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods if
asset groups are considered impaired the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds its fair value would be written off as an impairment loss intangible
assets and other longlived assets at june 30 2006 were 67 million and
404000 respectively

valuation of investments the company has made equity investments in
several startup and early development stage companies among them ccx dgi
and hemerus the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or
equity method is dependent upon a number of factors including but not
limited to the companys share in the equity of the investee and the
companys ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and
financial policies of the investee in determining which accounting treatment
to apply the company must make judgments based upon the quantitative and
qualitative aspects of the investment

the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment
development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are
dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and
development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor fda clearance
to market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to
fund operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received
the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of
its remaining net investment the companys net investments at june 30 2006
in ccx and hemerus were 142 million and 30 million respectively during
fiscal 2004 the company determined that its investment in dgi was other than
temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining net investment of
15 million

sharebased compensation the company adopted statement of accounting
standards sfas no 123r sharebased payment as of july 1 2005 sfas 123r
focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains
employee services through stockbased payment transactions the statement
requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in
exchange for the award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the
award at the date of grant determining the appropriate fair value model and
calculating the fair value of sharebased payment awards requires the input
of highly subjective assumptions including the expected life of the stock
based payment awards and stock price volatility the company uses the black
scholes model to value stock option awards the assumptions used in
calculating the fair value of stockbased payment awards represent the
companys best estimates but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of judgment as a result if factors change and different
assumptions are used stockbased compensation expense could be materially
different in the future in addition the company is required to estimate the
expected term and forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those
shares expected to vest if the actual forfeiture rate is materially
different from the estimate stockbased compensation expense could be
significantly different from what has been recorded in the current period as
of june 30 2006 the company had outstanding stock options for 421000
shares of common stock of those outstanding common stock options 382000
shares had vested as of june 30 2006 and 39000 shares were unvested as of
june 30 2006 unrecognized compensation expense was 367000 any
significant increase in future stockbased awards could materially impact
earnings

income taxes the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions
and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve
complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve in
fiscal 2005 the company reached a settlement with the state of minnesota for
525000 for fiscal years 2000 to 2002 the settlement was fully accrued for
at june 30 2004

assessment of claims or pending litigation the company is routinely
subject to claims and involved in legal actions which are incidental to the
business of the company although it is difficult to predict the ultimate
outcome of these matters management believes that any ultimate liability
will not materially affect the consolidated financial position or results of
operations of the company as additional information becomes available the
company will assess the potential liabilities related to claims or pending
litigation and revise estimates as needed such revisions could materially
impact the companys consolidated financial position or results of
operations

recent accounting pronouncements

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
staff position no 1091 application of fasb statement no 109 sfas 109
accounting for income taxes to the tax deduction on qualified production
activities provided by the american jobs creation act of 2004 fsp 1091
fsp 1091 clarifies that the manufacturers deduction provided for under the
american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca should be accounted for as a
special deduction in accordance with sfas 109 and not as a tax rate
reduction the manufacturers deduction was available to the company
beginning in fiscal year 2006 and the company accounted for the
manufacturers deduction as provided for in fsp 1091 the deduction reduced
income tax expense approximately 879000 for the year ended june 30 2006

the fasb also issued staff position no 1092 accounting and disclosure
guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american
jobs creation act of 2004 fsp 1092 the ajca introduces a special onetime
dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings
to a us taxpayer provided certain criteria are met the company
periodically evaluates the possibility of repatriating foreign earnings at
the present time deferred taxes have not been recorded on undistributed
earnings of foreign subsidiaries as the amounts are considered permanently
invested if the company decides to repatriate foreign earnings a onetime
charge may be recorded for the deferred taxes

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 accounting changes and error
corrections the statement replaces apb opinion no 20 accounting changes
and sfas no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements
sfas no 154 requires companies to apply voluntary changes in accounting
principles retrospectively whenever practicable the requirements are
effective for the company beginning in fiscal 2007 adoption of the statement
will not have an impact on the companys prior consolidated financial
statements as it is prospective in nature

in june 2006 the fasb issued interpretation no 48 fin 48 accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no
109 fin 48 requires disclosures of additional quantitative and qualitative
information regarding uncertain tax positions taken for taxreturn purposes
that have not been recognized for financial reporting along with analysis of
significant changes during each period the interpretation is effective for
the company in fiscal 2008 the company is currently evaluating the
provisions of fin 48 but it is not expected to have a material impact on the
companys consolidated financial statements

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially
adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes the company is exposed to
market risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro and the
british pound sterling to the us dollar as the financial position and
operating results of the companys uk subsidiary and european operations
are translated into us dollars for consolidation at the current level of
rd europe operating results a 10 increase or decrease in the average
exchange rate used to translate operating results into us dollars would
have an approximate 14 million effect on annual consolidated operating
income monthend exchange rates between the british pound and the us
dollar were as follows

                                     year ended june 30
                               2006         2005         2004
                                       
high                          187        192        187
low                            172         179         158
average                        178         186         175

the companys exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises
from transferring funds from the uk subsidiary to the us subsidiary and
from transferring funds from the german subsidiary and french sales office to
the uk subsidiary at june 30 2006 and 2005 the company had 257000 and
642000 respectively of dollar denominated intercompany debt at its uk
subsidiary and the uk subsidiary had 509000 and 510000 respectively
of dollar denominated intercompany debt from its european operations these
intercompany balances are revolving in nature and are not deemed to be long
term balances the companys uk subsidiary recognized net foreign currency
gains of 17000 british pound sterling 30000 135000 british pound
sterling 251000 and 36000 british pound sterling 64000 for the years
ended june 30 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the companys german
subsidiary recognized net foreign currency losses of 125000 euro 157000
for the year ended june 30 2005 the company does not enter into foreign
exchange forward contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign currency rate
changes on intercompany foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions

as of june 30 2006 the companys longterm debt consisted of a mortgage
note payable the interest rate on the mortgage is at a floating interest
rate at the one month london interbank offered rate libor plus 25 with a
floor of 4 the floating interest rate on the mortgage note payable was 76
as of june 30 2006

forwardlooking information

statements in this annual report and elsewhere that are forwardlooking
involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results
of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected
and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed
below

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research
scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university
and government research institutions changes in spending on research by such
companies and in funding of such universities and institutions by government
including the national institutes of health affects the revenues and
earnings of the company the company carries essentially no backlog of orders
and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause
fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

approximately one quarter of the companys sales are made through its
european subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign
currencies the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant
technological change while the hematology controls industry historically has
been less subject to rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted
significantly by changes in the automated testing equipment offered by
instrument manufacturers competitors of the company are numerous and
include among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory
instrument and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major
pharmaceutical companies universities and other research institutions there
can be no assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in
developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which
have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the
companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive

                                   23
page

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain
licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without
infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of
new products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies
developing new products related to the companys business and the
acquisition of companies for new products and additional customer base carry
risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be
adversely affected under the equity method of accounting a percentage of
the losses of certain companies in which the company invests will be reported
as losses of the company the company may not have control of the expense
levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those
anticipated by the company additionally if the company determines that its
investment in unconsolidated companies is other than temporarily impaired
the company may write off its entire investment in such company

ongoing research and development activities and the production and
marketing of certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by
numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries
the approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type
that may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in
obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products
developed by the company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical
to the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will
require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional
expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such
personnel could adversely affect the companys business

the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward
looking statements made due to new information or future events investors
are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements

material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting evaluating managements assessment testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances  we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company  2 provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company
and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
of  unauthorized  acquisition  use or  disposition  of the companys assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements  also projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate

developed several types of hematology controls designed to keep pace with the
technology of the newest models of hematology instruments  these products
are sold throughout the united states directly by rd systems and in many
foreign countries through distributors

in 1985 rd systems entered the research reagent market with its first
cytokine transforming growth factorbeta tgfbeta  cytokines are
specialized protein molecules that stimulate or suppress various cellular
functions in the body  cytokines are in demand by biomedical researchers who
want to learn more about their diverse effects  encouraged by its early
success in the cytokine market rd systems formed a biotechnology division
in fiscal 1986 with the goal of producing a wide range of cytokines through
genetic engineering  recombinant dna technology offers several advantages
over extraction of these proteins from natural sources including lower
production cost and potentially unlimited supply

in fiscal 1992 rd systems purchased amgen incs research reagent and
diagnostic assay kit business  with this purchase rd systems obtained
amgens erythropoietin epo kit the companys first enzymelinked
immunosorbent assay elisa kit for a cytokine that had been cleared by the
us food and drug administration fda for clinical diagnostic use

in fiscal 1994 the company acquired its european biotechnology distributor
british biotechnology products ltd renamed rd systems europe ltd from
british biotechnology group plc  rd europe distributes biotechnology
products developed and manufactured by rd systems

between fiscal 1998 and 2000 and in 2004 the company made equity investments
in the preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx a technology and drug
development company  the company currently holds approximately 199 of the
outstanding stock of ccx  in addition to the equity investment and joint
research efforts the company obtained research and diagnostic market rights
to all products discovered or developed by ccx

in fiscal 1999 rd systems purchased genzyme corporations genzyme
research products business  this acquisition established rd systems as the
worlds leading supplier of research and diagnostic cytokine products

in fiscal 2002 the company made an equity investment of 3 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi of minneapolis minnesota  dgi holds licenses from the university of
minnesota to develop technologies used for functional genomics and the
discovery of drugable targets  the company currently holds a 38 equity
interest in dgi and warrants to acquire additional equity  the company also
received the rights to develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins
discovered by dgi and an exclusive royalty free license to sell such
products in the research market  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
the company determined that its investment in dgi was other than temporarily
impaired and wrote off the remaining net investment of 15 million

in january 2004 the company purchased a 10 interest in hemerus medical llc
hemerus for 3 million  hemerus was formed in march 2001 and has acquired
and is developing technology for the separation of leukocytes from blood and
blood components

in july 2005 the company acquired fortron bio science inc and biospacific
inc for an aggregate 20 million in cash  fortron develops and manufactures
antibodies and biospacific is a worldwide supplier of biologics to
manufacturers of in vitro immunodiagnostic kits  the acquisitions will help
the company expand into the diagnostic market by offering research reagents
that may have future diagnostic application andor developing products
specifically for diagnostic markets


the market

the company through its two operating subsidiaries manufactures and sells
products for the clinical diagnostics market hematology controls and
calibrators and the biotechnology research and clinical diagnostics market
cytokines assays and related products  in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 rd
systems hematology division revenues accounted for approximately 9 11 and
11 respectively of consolidated revenues  revenues from rd systems
biotechnology division were 62 62 and 63 and revenues from rd europe
were 29 27 and 26 of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2005 2004 and
2003 respectively


                       biotechnology products

rd systems is the worlds leading supplier of cytokines and cytokinerelated
reagents to the biotechnology research community  these valuable proteins
exist in minute amounts in different types of cells and can be extracted from
these cells or made through recombinant dna technology  in 1985 rd systems
introduced its first cytokine and continues to add to this product line  the
first cytokines were extracted from natural sources human and porcine
platelets and bovine brain  currently almost all of cytokines are produced
by recombinant dna technology

the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines
exists because of the profound effect a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on
the cells and tissues of the body  cytokines are intercellular messengers
they act as signals by interacting with specific receptors on the affected
cells and trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell
tissue or organism  for example cytokines can signal a cell to
differentiate ie to acquire the features necessary for it to take on a
more specialized task  another example of cytokine action is the key role
played in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to grow and divide to
attract migratory cells to the injury site and mediate the healing process

in recent years rd systems biotechnology division has also added enzymes
and intracellular cell signaling reagents to its product portfolio   enzymes
are biological catalysts that accelerate a variety of chemical reactions in
cells  most enzymes including proteases kinases and phosphatases are
proteins that modify the structure and function of other proteins  many
enzymes are important markers and therapeutic targets for diseases such as
cancer alzheimers arthritis diabetes hypertension obesity aids and
sars

the biotechnology division markets its cytokine assay kits under the
tradename quantikiner  these kits are used by scientific researchers to
quantify the level of a specific cytokine in a sample of serum plasma or
other biological fluid  cytokine quantification is performed for basic
research and in pharmaceutical discovery and development programs

rd systems currently manufactures and sells over 8500 biotechnology
products

current biotechnology products

cytokines and enzymes  cytokines extracted from natural sources or
produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest
purity  enzymes and related factors including enzyme substrates and
inhibitors are highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest
biological activity

antibodies  antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system of an
animal that specifically recognize and bind to target molecules  the
companys polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals primarily goats
and purified from the animals blood  monoclonal antibodies are made by
immortalized cell lines derived from the individual antibody producing
cells of a rodent  monoclonal antibodies are secreted from these cell
lines during cell culture and purified from the cell culture medium

assay kits  this product line includes rd systems human and animal
quantikine kits which allow research scientists to quantify the amount of
a specific analyte cytokine adhesion molecule enzyme etc  in a
sample of serum or other biological fluids

clinical diagnostic kits  the epo kit acquired from amgen inc in fiscal
1992 was the first diagnostic assay for which rd systems received fda
marketing clearance  rd systems also has received fda marketing
clearance for its transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin kits

flow cytometry products  this product line includes rd systems labeled
antibodies and fluorokiner kits which are used to measure the presence or
absence of cell surface receptors for specific cytokines by flow
cytometry

reagents to study apoptosis programmed cell death and to elucidate
signal transduction pathways  products include antibodies phospho
specific antibodies antibody protein arrays active caspases kinases
and phosphatases and elisa assays to quantitate and measure the activity
of apoptotic and signaling molecules



                      hematology controls and calibrators

hematology controls and calibrators manufactured by and marketed through the
hematology division of rd systems are products composed of the various
cellular components of blood which have been stabilized  proper diagnosis of
many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patients blood
cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology
instruments  controls and calibrators produced by the hematology division
ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and reliably

                                   5

blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of which is mainly water and
blood cells which are suspended in the plasma  there are three basic types
of blood cells  red cells white cells and platelets   hemoglobin in red
cells transport oxygen from the lungs throughout the body  white cells
defend the body against foreign invaders  platelets serve as a plug to
stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a complex series of
biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot

these fundamental components red cells white cells and platelets differ
widely in size and concentration  as noted above hematology controls are
used in automated and semiautomated cell counting analyzers to make sure
these instruments are counting blood cells in patient samples accurately
one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is a
complete blood count or cbc  doctors use this test in disease screening and
diagnosis  more than one billion of these tests are done every year the
great majority with cell counting instruments  in most laboratories the cbc
consists of the white cell count the red cell count the hemoglobin reading
and the hematocrit reading the percent of red cells in a volume of whole
blood after it has been centrifuged  also included in a cbc test is the
differential which numbers and classifies the different types of white
cells

these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be
measured by automated or semiautomated cell counters  the number of
parameters measurable in a blood control product depends on the type and
sophistication of the instrument for which the control is designed
ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make
sure the instrument is reading accurately  in addition most instruments
need to be calibrated periodically  hematology calibrators are similar to
controls but go through additional testing to ensure that the calibration
values assigned are extremely accurate and can be used to calibrate the
instrument

the hematology division of rd systems offers a wide range of hematology
controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters
rd systems believes its products have improved stability and versatility and
a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors  the hematology
division supplies hematology control products for use as proficiency testing
materials by laboratory certifying authorities of a number of states and
countries

current retail hematology products

whole blood cbc controlscalibrators  the hematology division of rd
systems currently produces controls and calibrators for the following
brands of analyzers abbott diagnostics beckman coulter bayer technicon
and sysmex

linearity and reportable range controls  these products provide a means
of assessing the linearity of hematology analyzers for white blood cells
red blood cells platelets and reticulocytes immature red blood cells

rd systems is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its
major product lines  controls and calibrators hematology division and
cytokines antibodies assays and related products biotechnology division
the company believes that its future success depends to a large extent on
the ability to keep pace with changing technologies and markets  at the same
time the company continues to examine its production processes to ensure
high quality and maximum efficiency

rd systems biotechnology division is planning to release new cytokines
antibodies and cytokine assay kits in the coming year  all of these products
will be for research purposes only and therefore do not require fda
clearance  rd systems hematology division has developed several new
control products in fiscal 2005 and is continuously working on product
improvements and enhancements  however there is no assurance that any of
the products in the research and development phase can be developed or if
developed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

business relationships

the company has invested in the preferred stock series a and b of
chemocentryx inc ccx  ccx is a technology and drug development company
working in the area of chemokines  chemokines are cytokines which regulate
the trafficking patterns of leukocytes the effector cells of the human
immune system  in conjunction with the equity investment and joint research
efforts the company obtained exclusive worldwide research and diagnostic
marketing rights to chemokine proteins antibodies and receptors discovered
or developed by ccx  through april 2004 the company held 26 of the
outstanding stock of ccx and accounted for the investment under the equity
method of accounting  in may and june 2004 ccx obtained 381 million in
financing through the issuance of approximately 147 million shares of
preferred series b stock  the financing included a 51 million investment
by the company  after the financing the company holds a 199 equity
interest in ccx  the company then evaluated the cost versus equity method of
accounting for its investment in ccx and determined that it does not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of ccx and therefore after april 2004 accounted for its investment
on a cost basis the companys net investment in ccx was 51 million at june
30 2005 and 2004 the company has been issued warrants for 17 million
shares of ccx preferred stock series a at 500 per share which expire on
december 31 2005

in fiscal 2002 the company made an equity investment of 3 million 15
million shares and entered into a research and license agreement with
discovery genomics inc dgi of minneapolis minnesota  dgi holds licenses
from the university of minnesota to develop technologies used for functional
genomics and the discovery of drugable targets  the company currently holds
a 38 equity interest in dgi and warrants to acquire an additional 15
million shares at 250 per share  the company also received the rights to
develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins discovered by dgi and an
exclusive royaltyfree license to sell such products in the research market
the companys investment is accounted for under the equity method of
accounting  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the company determined
that its investment in dgi was other than temporarily impaired and wrote off
the remaining net investment of 15 million

on january 1 2004 the company purchased a 10 interest in hemerus medical
llc hemerus for 3 million hemerus was formed in march 2001 and has
acquired and is developing technology for the separation of leukocytes from
blood and blood components leukoreduced blood is important in blood
transfusion hemerus owns two patents and has several patent applications
pending and is currently pursuing fda clearance to market its products in the
us in parallel with this investment rd systems entered into a joint
research agreement with hemerus the research will involve joint projects to
explore the use of hemerus filter technology to applications within rd
systems hematology and biotechnology divisions such applications if any
may have commercial potential in other laboratory environments the company
accounts for its investment in hemerus under the equity method of accounting
as it is a limited liability corporation  the companys net investment in
hemerus was 26 million and 29 million at june 30 2005 and 2004
respectively

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market
for hematology controls and calibrators made by rd systems  in fiscal 2005
2004 and 2003 oem contracts accounted for 68 million 77 million and
72 million respectively or 4 5 and 5 of total consolidated revenues


government regulation

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under
the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended  all of rd systems
hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products
by the fda  the entire hematology control manufacturing process from
receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their
expiration date is strictly regulated and documented  fda inspectors make
periodic site inspections of the hematology divisions control operations and
facilities  hematology control manufacturing must comply with quality system
regulations qsr as set forth in the fdas regulations governing medical
devices

three of rd systems immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin
have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use  rd systems must
comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits  biotechnology products
manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do
not require fda clearance

some of rd systems research groups use small amounts of radioactive
materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development
activities  thus rd systems is subject to regulation by the us nuclear
regulatory commission nrc and has been granted an nrc license due to expire
in april 2006  the license is renewable annually  rd systems is also
subject to regulation and inspection by the department of health of the state
of minnesota for its use of radioactive materials  it has been granted a
certificate of registration which is renewable annually by the minnesota
department of health  the current certificate expires april 1 2006  rd
systems has had no difficulties in renewing these licenses in prior years and
has no reason to believe they will not be renewed in the future  if
however the licenses were not renewed it would have minimal effect on rd
systems business since there are other technologies the research groups
could use to replace radioisotopes

availability of raw materials

the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole
blood  human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks and porcine and
bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants  after raw
blood is received it is separated into its components processed and
stabilized  although the cost of human blood has increased owing largely to
the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases the higher cost of
these materials has not had a serious adverse effect on the companys
business  rd systems does not perform its own testing as the supplier tests
all human blood purchased  rd systems biotechnology division develops and
manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed in
house thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources  rd
systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials
necessary for the manufacture of products


patents and trademarks

rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls  rd
systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it
manufactures  no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will
be obtained  no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not
infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others
particularly for genetically engineered products rd systems has not
conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products  see item 3
legal proceedings below

rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent
holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to patented technology
or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine
and cytokine related products to the research market  for fiscal 2005 2004
and 2003 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately
26 million 23 million and 23 million respectively

rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its
hematology controls and biotechnology product groups  rd systems believes
it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those
which it has registered


seasonality of business

sales of products by rd systems and rd europe particularly rd europe
historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth
during the summer months  rd systems also usually experiences a slowing of
sales during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period  the company
believes this slowing is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan
and of academic schedules in the united states

significant customers

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during
fiscal 2005 2004 or 2003


backlog

there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of
the date of this report or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2004  the
majority of the companys biotechnology products are shipped within one day
of receipt of the customers order  the majority of hematology products are
shipped based on a preset recurring schedule


competition

the worldwide market for cytokines and research diagnostic assay kits is
being supplied by a number of biotechnology companies including bd
biosciences biosource international peprotech inc sigma chemical co
amersham biosciences fisher scientific and emd biosciences inc  rd
systems believes that it is the leading worldwide supplier of cytokine
related products in the research marketplace  rd systems believes that the
expanding line of its products their recognized quality and the growing
demand for these rare and versatile proteins antibodies and assay kits will
allow the company to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research
and diagnostic market

competition is intense in the hematology control business  the first control
products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic
instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell
counting  historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made
controls for use in their own instruments  with rapid expansion of the
instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled non
instrument manufacturers to gain a foothold  today the market is comprised
of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products
and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument
manufacturers  the principal hematology control competitors of rd systems
retail products are beckman coulter inc sysmex streck laboratories
abbott diagnostics biorad laboratories and bayer technicon  rd systems
believes it is the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the
marketplace behind beckman coulter and streck laboratories

risk factors

the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with
evaluation the companys business and any forwardlooking statements made in
this report and elsewhere  any of the following risks could materially
adversely affect the companys business operating results and financial
condition

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research
scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university
and government research institutions changes in spending on research by such
companies and in funding of such universities and institutions by government
including the national institutes of health affects the revenues and
earnings of the company the company carries essentially no backlog of orders
and changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause
fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

approximately one quarter of the companys sales are made through its
european subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign
currencies the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change while the hematology controls industry historically has been less
subject to rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by instrument
manufacturers competitors of the company are numerous and include among
others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument and
equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical
companies universities and other research institutions there can be no
assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in developing
technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or
are being developed by the company or that would render the companys
technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is negotiating
licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products claimed to be
owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement
study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company
may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may
have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain
activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing
additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse
effect on the company

                                     11
page

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of new
products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies
developing new products related to the companys business and the
acquisition of companies for new products and additional customer base carry
risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be
adversely affected under the equity method of accounting a percentage of
the losses of certain companies in which the company invests will be reported
as losses of the company the company may not have control of the expense
levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those
anticipated by the company additionally if the company determines that its
investment in such companies is other than temporarily impaired the
company may write off its entire investment in such company

ongoing research and development activities and the production and marketing
of certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by numerous
governmental authorities in the united states and other countries the
approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that
may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining
approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by
the company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical
to the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will
require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional
expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such
personnel could adversely affect the companys business

repurchase of approximately 29 million shares of its common stock under an
accelerated stock buyback asb transaction for an initial value of
approximately 100 million 3445 per share the transaction was completed
under a privately negotiated contract with an investment bank  the asb
agreement is subject to a market price adjustment provision based upon a
volume weighted average price during the ninemonth period ending in december

agreement in cash or shares of the companys common stock at an average
market price of 4350 which approximates the average market price from the

contract would be approximately 186 million or about 428000 shares the
purchase price adjustment will be reflected in stockholders equity at the
time of settlement

which effectively sets a minimum and maximum price the company will be
obligated to pay for such shares the collar was established in exchange for
an upfront payment of 35 million the minimum and maximum price for the
18 million shares is approximately 3900 and 4100 respectively  the
maximum additional amount that could be required to be paid related to the
shares subject to the collar is 85 million or about 215000 shares  the
adjusted price of the remaining 11 million repurchased shares will be based
upon the difference between the volume weighted average price during the
ninemonth period and the initial 3445 per share payment for each 100
change in the average market price during the ninemonth period the
companys obligation under the uncollared portion of the agreement would
increase or decrease by 11 million  should the company elect to settle the
asb agreement in shares each 100 increase in the average market price over
4000 during the ninemonth period will increase the number of shares
required for settlement under the uncollared portion of the agreement but
reduce the number of shares required by the collared portion of the contract
by a net amount of about 15000 shares

value of protein and antibody inventory does not change significantly from
quarter to quarter protein and antibody production is generally for high
volume products or for new products with limited initial sales the company
capitalizes protein and antibody costs each period in inventory however given

substantially all manufacturing costs for proteins and antibodies consisting
largely of wages benefits facility and equipment costs are expensed each
quarter a change in inventory value as a result of estimate changes in the

in may 2004 the company changed from the equity method to the cost method
of accounting for its investment in ccx and no longer records its share of ccx
losses in its consolidated results the change to the cost method of accounting
for ccx was the result of the companys ownership percentage declining below
20 and qualitative factors which indicated that the company does not exercise
significant influence over the operations of ccx the companys net investment
in ccx at both june 30 2005 and 2004 was 51 million as a development stage
company ccx is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to continue
its research and development efforts if such funding were unavailable or
inadequate to fund operations the company would potentially recognize an
impairment loss to the extent of its remaining net investment

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 the company determined that its
investment in dgi was other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the
remaining net investment of 15 million as an impairment loss

beginning in fiscal 2005 the companys share of hemerus losses are
included in other nonoperating expenses since hemerus began selling product
and was no longer considered a development stage company

excluding ccx dgi and hemerus losses research and development expenses
by the company increased 459000 and 527000 in fiscal 2005 and 2004
respectively these increases were primarily the result of the development of
new cytokines antibodies and assay kits by rd systems biotechnology
division

upon receiving fda clearance to market its products if such clearance is not
received the company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the
extent of its remaining net investment

or obligations other than the asb agreement discussed previously that have or
are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the companys financial
condition changes in the financial condition revenues or expenses results of
operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources


critical accounting policies

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and
results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis
management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its
business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing
is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies

valuation of accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment
history and the customers current creditworthiness as determined by
managements review of their current credit information the company
continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains
a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the companys historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been
identified while such credit losses have historically been within the
companys established provisions if the financial condition of the companys
customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments additional allowances may be required gross trade receivables
totaled 222 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was 118000 at
june 30 2005

valuation of inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost firstin
firstout method or market the company regularly reviews inventory on hand
for slowmoving and obsolete inventory inventory not meeting quality control
standards and inventory subject to expiration the manufacturing process for
proteins and antibodies has and may continue to produce quantities in excess of
forecasted usage the company values its manufactured protein and antibody
inventory based on a twoyear forecast proteins and antibody quantities in
excess of the twoyear usage forecast are considered impaired and not included
in the inventory value the value of protein and antibody inventory does not
change significantly from quarter to quarter protein and antibody production
is generally for highvolume products or for new products with limited initial
sales the company capitalizes protein and antibody costs each period in
inventory however given the insignificant changes in these inventory balances
each quarter substantially all manufacturing costs for proteins and
antibodies consisting largely of wages benefits facility and equipment
costs are expensed each quarter a change in inventory value as a result of
estimate changes in the twoyear forecast is reflected in cost of sales in the
period of change manufacturing costs and changes in inventory value for
proteins and antibodies charged to cost of sales were 66 million in fiscal
2005 inventories of proteins and antibodies in excess of the twoyear usage
forecast were 102 million at june 30 2005

valuation of goodwill the company is required to perform an annual review for
impairment of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting
standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is considered
to be impaired if it is determined that the carrying value of the reporting
unit exceeds its fair value assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the
company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its
reporting units and the allocation of the carrying value of shared assets to
the reporting units the companys annual assessment included comparison of the
carrying value of the net assets of the biotechnology division to its share of
the companys market capitalization at june 30 2005 a significant change in
the companys market capitalization or in the carrying value of net assets of
the biotechnology division could result in an impairment charge in future
periods goodwill at june 30 2005 was 125 million

                                       22
page

valuation of intangible and other longlived assets the company periodically
assesses the impairment of intangible and other longlived assets which
requires it to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of these
asset groups asset groups are considered to be impaired if their carrying
value exceeds the asset groups ability to continue to generate income from
operations and positive cash flow in future periods if asset groups are
considered impaired the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair
value would be written off as an impairment loss intangible assets and other
longlived assets at june 30 2005 were 16 million and 617000
respectively

valuation of investments the company has made equity investments in several
startup and early development stage companies among them ccx dgi and
hemerus the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity
method is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to
the companys share in the equity of the investee and the companys ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee in determining which accounting treatment to apply the company must
make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
investment

the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment
development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are
dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and
development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor fda clearance to
market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund
operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received the
company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its
remaining net investment the companys net investments at june 30 2005 in ccx
and hemerus were 51 million and 26 million respectively during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 the company determined that its investment in dgi was
other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining net investment of
15 million

income taxes the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is
subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex
issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve in fiscal
2005 the company reached a settlement with the state of minnesota for 525000
for fiscal years 2000 to 2002 the settlement was fully accrued for at june 30
2004

assessment of claims or pending litigation the company is routinely subject to
claims and involved in legal actions which are incidental to the business of
the company although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters management believes that any ultimate liability will not materially
affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
company as additional information becomes available the company will assess
the potential liabilities related to claims or pending litigation and revise
estimates as needed such revisions could materially impact the companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations


recent accounting pronouncements

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
statement of accounting standards no 123 revised 2004 sfas no 123r
sharebased payment sfas no 123r is a revision of fasb statement no 123
accounting for stockbased compensation and supersedes accounting principles
board apb opinion no 25 accounting for stock issued to employees and its
related implementation guidance the statement focuses primarily on accounting
for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services through
sharebased payment transactions sfas no 123r requires a public entity measure
the cost of employee services received in exchange for the award of equity
instruments based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant the cost
will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to
provide services in exchange for the award sfas no 123r is effective as of
the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june 15
2005 and the company will adopt the standard in the first quarter of fiscal
2006 while the company cannot precisely determine the impact on net earnings
as a result of the adoption of sfas no 123r estimated compensation expense
of about 12 million or 003 per diluted share is anticipated for fiscal
2006 the ultimate amount of increased compensation expense will be dependent
on the number of future option shares granted their timing and vesting period
and the method used to calculated the fair value of the awards among other
factors

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 151 inventory costs the
statement amends accounting research bulletin no 43 to clarify the accounting
for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and
spoilage the statement also requires the allocation of fixed production
overheads to inventory be based on normal production capacity sfas no 151 is
effective for the company for inventory costs incurred beginning in fiscal
2006 adoption of the statement is not expected to have a significant impact on
the companys consolidated financial statements

in december 2004 the fasb issued staff position no 1091 application of
fasb statement no 109 sfas 109 accounting for income taxes to the tax
deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs
creation act of 2004 fsp 1091 fsp 1091 clarifies that the manufacturers
deduction provided for under the american jobs creation act of 2004 ajca
should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with sfas 109 and
not as a tax rate reduction the adoption of fsp 1091 had no impact on the
companys results of operations or financial position for fiscal year 2005
because the manufacturers deduction is not available to the company until
fiscal year 2006 the company is evaluating the effect that the manufacturers
deduction will have in subsequent years

the fasb also issued staff position no 1092 accounting and disclosure
guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american
jobs creation act of 2004 fsp 1092 the ajca introduces a special onetime
dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to
a us taxpayer provided certain criteria are met the company periodically
evaluates the possibility of repatriating foreign earnings at the present
time deferred taxes have not been recorded on undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries as it is the companys intent to indefinitely reinvest the
undistributed earnings

corrections the statement replaces apb opinion no 20 accounting changes and
sfas no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements sfas
no 154 requires companies to apply voluntary changes in accounting principles
retrospectively whenever practicable the requirements are effective for the
company beginning in fiscal 2007 adoption of the statement is not expected to
have a significant impact on the companys consolidated financial statements


market risk

at the end of fiscal 2005 the company had an independently managed investment
portfolio of fixed income securities excluding those classified as cash and
cash equivalents of 587 million see note a of notes to consolidated
financial statements these securities like all fixed income instruments are
subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest
rates increase

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially
adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes the company is exposed to
market risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro and the british
pound to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the
companys uk subsidiary and european operations are translated into us
dollars for consolidation at the current level of rd europe operating
results a 10 increase or decrease in the average exchange rate used to
translate operating results into us dollars would have an approximate 14
million effect on consolidated operating income annually monthend exchange
rates between the british pound and the us dollar were as follows

                                           year ended june 30
                                  2005          2004         2003

the companys exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises
from transferring funds from the uk subsidiary to the us subsidiary and
from transferring funds from the german subsidiary and french sales office to
the uk subsidiary at june 30 2005 and 2004 the company had 642000 and
119000 dollar denominated intercompany debt at its uk subsidiary and the
uk subsidiary had 510000 and 93000 dollar denominated intercompany debt
from its european operations these intercompany balances are revolving in
nature and are not deemed to be longterm balances the companys uk
subsidiary recognized net foreign currency gains of 135000 british pounds
251000 36000 british pounds64000 and 224000 british pounds
356000 for the years ended june 30 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively
the companys german subsidiary recognized net foreign currency losses of
125000 euros 157000 for the year ended june 30 2005 the company does
not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce its exposure to
foreign currency rate changes on intercompany foreign currency denominated
balance sheet positions

as of june 30 2005 the companys longterm debt consisted of a mortgage
note payable the interest rate on the mortgage is at a floating interest rate
at the one month london interbank offered rate libor plus 25 with a floor
of 4 the floating interest rate on the mortgage note payable was 56 as of
june 30 2005

in march 2005 the company repurchased approximately 29 million shares of
its common stock under an accelerated stock buyback asb transaction for an
initial value of approximately 100 million 3445 per share the asb
agreement is subject to a market price adjustment provision based upon a volume
weighted average price during the ninemonth period ending in december 2005 in
december 2005 the company will at its option settle the asb agreement in
cash or shares of the companys common stock at an average market price of
4350 which approximates the average market price from the transaction date
through june 30 2005 the settlement amount for the contract would be
approximately 186 million or about 428000 shares

approximately 18 million of the shares repurchased are subject to a
collar which effectively sets a minimum and maximum price the company will be
obligated to pay for such shares the collar was established in exchange for an
upfront payment of 35 million the minimum and maximum price for the 18
million shares is approximately 3900 and 4100 respectively the maximum
additional amount that could be required to be paid related to the shares
subject to the collar is 85 million or about 215000 shares the adjusted
price of the remaining 11 million repurchased shares will be based upon the
difference between the volume weighted average price during the ninemonth
period and the initial 3445 per share payment for each 100 change in the
average market price during the ninemonth period the companys obligation
under the uncollared portion of the agreement would increase or decrease by
11 million should the company elect to settle the asb agreement in shares
each 100 increase in the average market price over 4000 during the
ninemonth period will increase the number of shares required for settlement
under the uncollared portion of the agreement but reduce the number of shares
required by the collared portion of the contract by a net amount of about
15000 shares


forwardlooking information

statements in this annual report and elsewhere that are forwardlooking
involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results
of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected
and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed
below

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research
scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and
government research institutions changes in spending on research by such
companies and in funding of such universities and institutions by government
including the national institutes of health affects the revenues and earnings
of the company the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and
changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations
in quarterly revenues and earnings

approximately one quarter of the companys sales are made through its
european subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign
currencies the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant
technological change while the hematology controls industry historically has
been less subject to rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted
significantly by changes in the automated testing equipment offered by
instrument manufacturers competitors of the company are numerous and include
among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument
and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical
companies universities and other research institutions there can be no
assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in developing
technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been
or are being developed by the company or that would render the companys
technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive


                                       25

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain
licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without
infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of
new products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies
developing new products related to the companys business and the acquisition
of companies for new products and additional customer base carry risks that
objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected
under the equity method of accounting a percentage of the losses of certain
companies in which the company invests will be reported as losses of the
company the company may not have control of the expense levels of such
companies and their losses may be greater than those anticipated by the
company additionally if the company determines that its investment in such
companies is other than temporarily impaired the company may write off its
entire investment in such company

ongoing research and development activities and the production and
marketing of certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by
numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries the
approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that
may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining
approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the
company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical to
the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require
the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by
existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could
adversely affect the companys business

the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any
forwardlooking statements made due to new information or future events
investors are cautioned not to place undue emphasis on these statements

maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
our responsibility is to express an opinion on managements assessment and an
opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company
accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting evaluating managements assessment testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances  we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion

a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a companys
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable
detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the company  2 provide reasonable assurance that

overview

techne corporation the company is a holding company which has two wholly
owned operating subsidiaries  research and diagnostic systems inc rd
systems located in minneapolis minnesota and rd systems europe ltd rd
europe located in abingdon england  rd systems is a specialty
manufacturer of biological products  its two major operating segments are
hematology controls which are used in hospital and clinical laboratories to
check the performance of blood analysis instruments and biotechnology
products including purified proteins cytokines and antibodies which are
sold exclusively to the research market and assay kits which are sold to the
research and clinical diagnostic markets  rd europe distributes rd
systems biotechnology products in europe  rd europe has a german sales
subsidiary rd systems gmbh rd gmbh and a sales office in france

rd systems was founded and incorporated in 1976 in minneapolis minnesota
and was acquired by the company in 1985  in 1977 rd systems introduced its
first product a plateletrichplasma control  in 1981 rd systems was the
second manufacturer in the world to release a whole blood control with
platelets thereby establishing itself as one of the leaders in the field of
hematology control products manufacturing  subsequently rd systems has
developed several types of hematology controls designed to keep pace with the
technology of the newest models of hematology instruments  these products
are sold throughout the united states directly by rd systems and in many
foreign countries through distributors

in 1985 rd systems entered the research reagent market with its first
cytokine transforming growth factorbeta tgfbeta  cytokines are
specialized protein molecules that stimulate or suppress various cellular
functions in the body  cytokines are in demand by biomedical researchers who
want to learn more about their diverse effects  encouraged by its early
success in the cytokine market rd systems formed a biotechnology division
in fiscal 1986 with the goal of producing a wide range of cytokines through
genetic engineering  recombinant dna technology offers several advantages
over extraction of these proteins from natural sources including lower
production cost and potentially unlimited supply

in fiscal 1992 rd systems purchased amgen incs research reagent and
diagnostic assay kit business  with this purchase rd systems obtained
amgens erythropoietin epo kit the companys first enzymelinked
immunosorbent assay kit for a cytokine that had been cleared by the us food
and drug administration fda for clinical diagnostic use

in fiscal 1994 the company acquired its european biotechnology distributor
british biotechnology products ltd renamed rd systems europe ltd from
british biotechnology group plc  rd europe distributes biotechnology
products developed and manufactured by rd systems

between fiscal 1998 and 2000 and in 2004 the company made equity investments
in the preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx a technology and drug
development company  the company currently holds approximately 199 of the
outstanding stock of ccx  in addition to the equity investment and joint
research efforts the company obtained research and diagnostic market rights
to all products discovered or developed by ccx

                                       3

in fiscal 1999 rd systems purchased genzyme corporations research products
business  this acquisition established rd systems as the worlds leading
supplier of research and diagnostic cytokine products  included in
consolidated cost of sales for fiscal 2003 and 2002 were 23 million and
18 million respectively of royalties paid to genzyme under the purchase
agreement  the royalty agreement expired on june 30 2003

in fiscal 2002 the company made an equity investment of 3 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi of minneapolis minnesota  dgi holds licenses from the university of
minnesota to develop technologies used for functional genomics and the
discovery of drugable targets  the company currently holds a 38 equity
interest in dgi and warrants to acquire additional equity  the company also
received the rights to develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins
discovered by dgi and an exclusive royalty free license to sell such
products in the research market  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004
the company determined that its investment in dgi was other than temporarily
impaired and wrote off the remaining net investment of 15 million

in january 2004 the company purchased a 10 interest in hemerus medical llc
hemerus for 3 million  hemerus was formed in march 2001 and has acquired
and is developing technology for the separation of leukocytes from blood and
blood components


the market

the company through its two operating subsidiaries manufactures and sells
products for the clinical diagnostics market hematology controls and
calibrators and the biotechnology research and clinical diagnostics market
cytokines assays and related products  in fiscal 2004 2003 and 2002 rd
systems hematology division revenues accounted for approximately 11 11
and 12 respectively of consolidated revenues  revenues from rd systems
biotechnology division were 62 63 and 65 and revenues from rd europe
were 27 26 and 23 of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2004 2003 and
2002 respectively


                        biotechnology products

rd systems is the worlds leading supplier of cytokines and cytokinerelated
reagents to the biotechnology research community  these valuable proteins
exist in minute amounts in different types of cells and can be extracted from
these cells or made through recombinant dna technology  in 1985 rd systems
introduced its first cytokine and continues to add to this product line  the
first cytokines were extracted from natural sources human and porcine
platelets and bovine brain  currently almost all of cytokines are produced
by recombinant dna technology

the growing interest by academic and commercial researchers in cytokines
exists because of the profound effect a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on
the cells and tissues of the body  cytokines are intercellular messengers
they act as signals by interacting with specific receptors on the affected
cells  they carry vital signals to the cells genetic machinery that can
trigger events that can lead to significant changes in a cell tissue or
organism  for example cytokines can signal a cell to differentiate ie
to acquire the features necessary for it to take on a more specialized task
another example of cytokine action is the key role played in stimulating
cells surrounding a wound to grow and divide to attract migratory cells to
the injury site and mediate the healing process

in recent years rd systems biotechnology division has also added enzymes
to its product portfolio   enzymes are biological catalysts that accelerate
a variety of chemical reactions in cells  most enzymes including proteases
kinases and phosphatases are proteins that modify the structure and function
of other proteins  many enzymes are important markers and therapeutic
targets for diseases such as cancer alzheimers arthritis diabetes
hypertension obesity aids and sars

the biotechnology division markets its cytokine assay kits under the
tradename quantikiner  these kits are used by scientific researchers to
quantify the level of a specific cytokine in a sample of serum plasma or
other biological fluid for basic research and for cytokine studies in
pharmaceutical discovery and development programs

rd systems currently manufactures and sells over 6800 biotechnology
products

current biotechnology products

cytokines and enzymes  cytokines extracted from natural sources or produced
using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest purity
enzymes and related factors including enzyme substrates and inhibitors are
highly purified and characterized to ensure the highest biological activity

antibodies  the companys polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals
primarily goats  the animals immune systems recognize an injected
cytokine as foreign and develop antibodies to the cytokine  the polyclonal
antibodies are then purified from the animals blood  monoclonal antibodies
are produced by injecting purified cytokines into mice or by an in vitro
animalfree process

assay kits  this product line includes rd systems human and animal
quantikine kits which allow research scientists to quantify the amount of a
specific cytokine in a sample of serum or other biological fluids  also
included in this product line are assay kits developed by rd europe to
quantify adhesion molecules  these kits are used by research scientists to
measure cellular adhesion molecules in serum plasma or cell culture media
cellular adhesion molecules facilitate the movement of infection fighting
cells out of the blood stream to the site of the infection or injury

clinical diagnostic kits  the epo kit acquired from amgen inc in fiscal
1992 was the first diagnostic assay for which rd systems received fda
marketing clearance  rd systems also has received fda marketing clearance
for its transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin kits

flow cytometry products  this product line includes rd systems fluorokiner
kits which are used to measure the presence or absence of cell surface
receptors for specific cytokines

dna and related products  this diverse product line includes  primer pairs
which are synthetic dna used to amplify specific genes in the laboratory
messenger rna kits that allow researchers to quantitate the amount of a
specific cytokine messenger rna and reagents for the study of dna damage and
repair mechanisms in the cell

                  hematology controls and calibrators

hematology controls and calibrators manufactured by and marketed through the
hematology division of rd systems are products composed of the various
cellular components of blood which have been stabilized  proper diagnosis of
many illnesses requires a thorough and accurate analysis of a patients blood
cells which is usually done with automated or semiautomated hematology
instruments  controls and calibrators produced by the hematology division
ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and reliably

blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of which is mainly water and
blood cells which are suspended in the plasma  there are three basic types
of blood cells  red cells white cells and platelets   red cells transport
oxygen from the lungs throughout the body which is the function of
hemoglobin  white cells defend the body against foreign invaders  platelets
serve as a plug to stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a
complex series of biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot

these fundamental components red cells white cells and platelets differ
widely in size and concentration  the white cells are the largest in size
and platelets the smallest  the red cells are the most numerous and
constitute 95 percent of all blood cells  the average adult has from 20 to
30 trillion red cells  for every 500 red cells there are approximately one
white cell and about 20 platelets  as noted above hematology controls are
used in automated and semiautomated cell counting analyzers to make sure
these instruments are counting blood cells in patient samples accurately
one of the most frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is
called a complete blood count or cbc for short  doctors use this test in
disease screening and diagnosis  more than one billion of these tests are
done every year the great majority with cell counting instruments  in most
laboratories the cbc consists of the white cell count the red cell count
the hemoglobin reading and the hematocrit reading the percent of red cells
in a volume of whole blood after it has been centrifuged  also included in
a cbc test is the differential which numbers and classifies the different
types of white cells

these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be
measured by automated or semiautomated cell counters  the number of
parameters measurable in a blood control product depends on the type and
sophistication of the instrument for which the control is designed
ordinarily a hematology control is used once to several times a day to make
sure the instrument is reading accurately  in addition most instruments
need to be calibrated periodically  hematology calibrators are similar to
controls but go through additional testing to ensure that the calibration
values assigned are extremely accurate and can be used to calibrate the
instrument

the hematology division of rd systems offers a wide range of hematology
controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters
rd systems believes its products have improved stability and versatility and
a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors  the hematology
division supplies hematology control products for use as proficiency testing
materials by laboratory certifying authorities of a number of states and
countries    rd systems recognizes that developing technologies for cell
counting instruments will require increasingly sophisticated and highquality
controls and is prepared to meet this challenge

current retail hematology products

whole blood cbc controlscalibrators  the hematology division of rd systems
currently produces controls and calibrators for the following brands of
analyzers abbott diagnostics beckman coulter bayer technicon and sysmex

linearity and reportable range controls  these products provide a means of
assessing the linearity of hematology analyzers for white blood cells red
blood cells platelets and reticulocytes  because hematology analyzers are
single point calibrated these products allow users to determine and validate
the reportable range of an instrument

whole blood reticulocyte controls  these controls are designed for manual
and automated counting of reticulocytes immature red blood cells

whole blood flow cytometry controls  these products are controls for flow
cytometry instruments  these instruments are used to identify and quantify
white blood cells by their surface markers

whole blood glucosehemoglobin control  this product is designed to monitor
instruments which measure glucose and hemoglobin in whole blood

erythrocyte sedimentation rate control  this product is designed to monitor
erythrocyte sedimentation rate tests

multipurpose platelet reference controls  these products platelettrolr ii
and platelettrol extended are designed for use by automated and semi
automated analyzers


products under development

rd systems is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its
major product lines  controls and calibrators hematology division and
cytokines antibodies assays and related products biotechnology division
the company believes that its future success depends to a large extent on
the ability to keep pace with changing technologies and markets  at the same
time the company continues to examine its production processes to ensure
high quality and maximum efficiency

rd systems biotechnology division is planning to release new cytokines
antibodies and cytokine assay kits in the coming year  all of these products
will be for research purposes only and therefore do not require fda
clearance  rd systems hematology division has developed several new
control products in fiscal 2004 and is continuously working on product
improvements and enhancements  however there is no assurance that any of
the products in the research and development phase can be developed or if
developed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

included in consolidated research and development expense are the companys
share of losses by ccx and dgi and hemerus companies in which the company

business relationships

the company has invested in the preferred stock series a and b of
chemocentryx inc ccx  ccx is a technology and drug development company
working in the area of chemokines  chemokines are cytokines which regulate
the trafficking patterns of leukocytes the effector cells of the human
immune system  in conjunction with the equity investment and joint research
efforts the company obtained exclusive worldwide research and diagnostic
marketing rights to chemokine proteins antibodies and receptors discovered
or developed by ccx  through april 2004 the company held 26 of the
outstanding stock of ccx and accounted for the investment under the equity
method of accounting  in may and june 2004 ccx obtained 381 million in
financing through the issuance of approximately 147 million shares of
preferred series b stock  the financing included a 51 million investment
by the company  after the financing the company holds a 199 equity
interest in ccx  the company then evaluated the cost versus equity method of
accounting for its investment in ccx and determined that it does not have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial
policies of ccx and therefore after april 2004 accounted for its investment
on a cost basis the companys net investment in ccx was 51 million and
25 million at june 30 2004 and 2003 respectively the company has been
issued warrants for 17 million shares of ccx preferred stock series a
which expire on december 31 2005

in fiscal 2002 the company made an equity investment of 3 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi of minneapolis minnesota  dgi holds licenses from the university of
minnesota to develop technologies used for functional genomics and the
discovery of drugable targets  the company currently holds a 38 equity
interest in dgi and warrants to acquire additional equity  the company also
received the rights to develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins
discovered by dgi and an exclusive royaltyfree license to sell such
products in the research market  the companys investment is accounted for
under the equity method of accounting  during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2004 the company determined that its investment in dgi was other than
temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining net investment of 15
million  the companys net investment in dgi was 19 million at june 30
2003

on january 1 2004 the company purchased a 10 interest in hemerus medical
llc hemerus for 3 million hemerus was formed in march 2001 and has
acquired and is developing technology for the separation of leukocytes from
blood and blood components leukoreduced blood is important in blood
transfusion hemerus owns two patents and has several patent applications
pending and is currently pursuing fda clearance to market its products in the
us in parallel with this investment rd systems entered into a joint
research agreement with hemerus the research will involve joint projects to
explore the use of hemerus filter technology to applications within rd
systems hematology and biotechnology divisions such applications if any
may have commercial potential in other laboratory environments the company
accounts for its investment in hemerus under the equity method of accounting
the companys net investment in hemerus was 29 million at june 30 2004

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market
for hematology controls and calibrators made by rd systems  in fiscal 2004
2003 and 2002 oem contracts accounted for 77 million 72 million and
76 million respectively or 5 5 and 6 of total consolidated revenues


government regulation

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under
the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended  all of rd systems
hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products
by the fda  the entire hematology control manufacturing process from
receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their
expiration date is strictly regulated and documented  fda inspectors make
periodic site inspections of the hematology divisions control operations and
facilities  hematology control manufacturing must comply with quality system
regulations qsr as set forth in the fdas regulations governing medical
devices

                                        8
page

three of rd systems immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin
have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use  rd systems must
comply with qsr for the manufacture of these kits  biotechnology products
manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do
not require fda clearance

some of rd systems research groups use small amounts of radioactive
materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development
activities  thus rd systems is subject to regulation by the us nuclear
regulatory commission nrc and has been granted an nrc license due to expire
in april 2005  the license is renewable annually  rd systems is also
subject to regulation and inspection by the department of health of the state
of minnesota for its use of radioactive materials  it has been granted a
certificate of registration which is renewable annually by the minnesota
department of health  the current certificate expires april 1 2005  rd
systems has had no difficulties in renewing these licenses in prior years and
has no reason to believe they will not be renewed in the future  if
however the licenses were not renewed it would have minimal effect on rd
systems business since there are other technologies the research groups
could use to replace radioisotopes


availability of raw materials

the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole
blood  human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks and porcine and
bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants  after raw
blood is received it is separated into its components processed and
stabilized  although the cost of human blood has increased owing largely to
the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases the higher cost of
these materials has not had a serious adverse effect on the companys
business  rd systems does not perform its own testing as the supplier tests
all human blood purchased  rd systems biotechnology division develops and
manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed in
house thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources  rd
systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials
necessary for the manufacture of products


patents and trademarks

rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls  rd
systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it
manufactures  no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will
be obtained  no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not
infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others
particularly for genetically engineered products rd systems has not
conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products  see item 3
legal proceedings below

rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent
holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to patented technology
or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine
and cytokine related products to the research market  for fiscal 2004 2003
and 2002 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately
23 million 23 million and  21 million respectively

rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its
hematology controls and biotechnology product groups  rd systems believes
it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those
which it has registered

seasonality of business

sales of products by rd systems and rd europe particularly rd europe
historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth
during the summer months  rd systems also usually experiences a slowing of
sales during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period  the company
believes this slowing is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan
and of academic schedules in the united states


significant customers

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during
fiscal 2004 2003 or 2002


backlog

there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of
the date of this report or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2003  the
majority of the companys biotechnology products are shipped within one day
of receipt of the customers order  the majority of hematology products are
shipped based on a preset recurring schedule


competition

the worldwide market for cytokines and research diagnostic assay kits is
being supplied by a number of biotechnology companies including bd
biosciences biosource international peprotech inc sigma chemical co
amersham biosciences fisher scientific and emd biosciences inc  rd
systems believes that it is the leading worldwide supplier of cytokine
related products in the research marketplace  rd systems believes that the
expanding line of its products their recognized quality and the growing
demand for these rare and versatile proteins antibodies and assay kits will
allow the company to remain competitive in the growing biotechnology research
and diagnostic market

competition is intense in the hematology control business  the first control
products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic
instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell
counting  historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made
controls for use in their own instruments  with rapid expansion of the
instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled non
instrument manufacturers to gain a foothold  today the market is comprised
of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products
and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument
manufacturers  the principal hematology control competitors of rd systems
retail products are beckman coulter inc sysmex streck laboratories
abbott diagnostics biorad laboratories and bayer technicon  rd systems
believes it is the third largest supplier of hematology controls in the
marketplace behind beckman coulter and streck laboratories


employees

rd systems had 484 fulltime and 40 parttime employees as of june 30 2004
rd europe had 50 fulltime and 12 parttime employees as of june 30 2004
including 10 fulltime and 1 parttime at rd europes sales subsidiary in

cautionary statements

the company wishes to caution investors that the following important factors
among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the
companys actual results of operations and cause such results to differ
materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements made in this
document and elsewhere by or on behalf of the company

                                            11

technological obsolescence and competition

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change  while the hematology controls industry historically has been subject
to less rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by instrument
manufacturers  competitors of the company in the united states and abroad
are numerous and include among others specialized biotechnology firms
medical laboratory instrument and equipment manufacturers and disposables
suppliers major pharmaceutical companies universities and other research
institutions  there can be no assurance that the companys competitors will
not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective
than any which have been or are being developed by the company or that would
render the companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive
many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and product
development production and marketing capabilities than the company  with
regard to diagnostic kits which constitute a relatively minor portion of the
companys business many of the companys competitors have significantly
greater experience than the company in undertaking preclinical testing and
clinical trials of new or improved diagnostic kits and obtaining fda and
other regulatory approvals of such products

research spending

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research
scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university
and government research institutions  changes in spending on research by
such companies and in funding of such universities and institutions by
government including the national institutes of health affect the revenues
and earnings of the company  the companys biotechnology division carries
essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received
and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

foreign currency exchange rates

approximately one quarter of the companys sales are made through its
european subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign
currencies  the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates

patents and proprietary rights

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others  the company has filed a very limited
number of united states and foreign patent applications for products in which
it believes it has a proprietary interest  the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others  the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products  it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company  the patenting of hematology and biotechnology
processes and products involves complex legal and factual questions and to
date there has emerged no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims
in biotechnology patents  protracted and costly litigation may be necessary
to enforce rights of the company and defend against claims of infringement of
rights of others  see item 3 legal proceedings below

                                          12

financial impact of expansion strategy

the company engages in an expansion strategy which includes internal
development of new products collaboration with manufacturers of automated
instruments which may use the companys products investment in joint
ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys
business and acquisition of companies for new products or additional customer
base  each of the strategies carries risks that objectives will not be
achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected  during the early
development stage under the equity method of accounting a percentage of the
losses of certain companies in which the company may invest will be reported
as losses of the company  the company may not have control of the expense
levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those
anticipated by the company  in addition the company may be required to write
off investments if they are determined to be other than temporarily impaired

government regulation

ongoing research and development activities including preclinical and
clinical testing and the production and marketing of certain of the
companys products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental
authorities in the united states and other countries  some of the companys
products and manufacturing processes and facilities require governmental
approval prior to commercial use  the approval process applicable to
clinical diagnostic products of the type which may be developed by the
company may take a year or more  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals
would adversely affect the marketing of products developed by the company and
the companys ability to receive product revenues or royalties  there can be
no assurance that regulatory approvals for such products will be obtained
without lengthy delays if at all

attraction and retention of key employees

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical
to the companys success  although the company believes it has been and will
be able to attract and retain such personnel there can be no assurance that
the company will be successful  in addition the companys anticipated
growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional
expertise such as clinical testing government approvals production and
marketing will require the addition of new management personnel and the
development of additional expertise by existing management personnel  the
failure to attract and retain such personnel or to develop such expertise
would adversely affect the companys business

activities in fiscal 2004 of 115 million was the result of increased net
earnings and a 11 million decrease in trade and other accounts payable

partially offset by a 33 million increase in income taxes payable compared to
a 65 million increase in fiscal 2003 net earnings in fiscal 2004 increased
91 million before the 15 million impairment loss on the writeoff of the
companys investment in dgi which did not affect the companys cash balances

was mainly the result of 38 million less in royalties payable to genzyme
inc stemming from the fiscal 1999 acquisition of genzymes research product
business under which royalties were due through fiscal 2003 the 28 million
change in income taxes payable between fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 was due to

payable compared to fiscal 2003 offset by higher us income tax payments in
fiscal 2004 75 million more than made in fiscal 2003

264 million was the result of increased net earnings increased losses by
equity method investees and a 65 million increase in income taxes payable
compared to a 44 million decrease in fiscal 2002 these changes were
partially offset by decreased goodwill amortization and a 61 million decrease
in trade and other accounts payable compared to a 28 million decrease in
fiscal 2002 net earnings increased approximately 183 million from fiscal
2002 to fiscal 2003 while losses by equity method investees which do not
affect the companys cash balances increased 13 million from fiscal 2002
the change in income taxes payable of 109 million was mainly the result of
higher us taxable income in fiscal 2003 39 million increase in us income
taxes payable compared to fiscal 2002 and lower income tax payments made in
fiscal 2003 51 less than made in fiscal 2002 goodwill amortization
decreased 63 million in fiscal 2003 as a result of adoption of statement of
financial accounting standards no 142

offbalance sheet arrangements

the company is not a party to any offbalance sheet transactions arrangements
or obligations that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect
on the companys financial condition changes in the financial condition
revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or
capital resources


critical accounting policies

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and
results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis
management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its
business operations and an understanding of results of operations the listing
is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting policies

valuation of accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment
history and the customers current creditworthiness as determined by
managements review of their current credit information the company
continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains
a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the companys historical
experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been
identified while such credit losses have historically been within the
companys established provisions if the financial condition of the companys
customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to
make payments additional allowances may be required gross trade receivables
totaled 205 million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was 233000 at
june 30 2004

valuation of inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin
firstout method or market the company regularly reviews inventories on hand
for slowmoving and obsolete inventory inventory not meeting quality control
standards and inventory subject to expiration the manufacturing process for
proteins and antibodies has and may continue to produce quantities in excess of
forecasted usage individual protein and antibody sales volumes can be volatile
and the company believes that forecasting sales volumes for individual products
beyond a twoyear period is highly uncertain as a result the company values
its manufactured protein and antibody inventory based on a twoyear sales
forecast any significant unanticipated changes in product demand or market
conditions could have an impact on the value of inventories and the change in
value would be reflected in cost of sales in the period of the change
inventories of proteins and antibodies in excess of the twoyear sales forecast
were 86 million at june 30 2004

valuation of goodwill the company is required to perform an annual review for
impairment of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting
standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is considered
to be impaired if it is determined that the carrying value of the reporting
unit exceeds its fair value assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the
company to make judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its
reporting units and the allocation of the carrying value of shared assets to
the reporting units the companys annual assessment included comparison of
the carrying value of the net assets of the biotechnology division to its
share of the companys market capitalization at june 30 2004 a significant
change in the companys market capitalization or in the carrying value of net
assets of the biotechnology division could result in an impairment charge in
future periods goodwill at june 30 2004 was 125 million

                                       23

page

valuation of intangible and other longlived assets the company periodically
assesses the impairment of intangible and other longlived assets which
requires it to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of these
asset groups asset groups are considered to be impaired if their carrying
value exceeds the asset groups ability to continue to generate income from
operations and positive cash flow in future periods if asset groups are
considered impaired the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair
value would be written off as an impairment loss intangible assets and other
longlived assets at june 30 2004 were 28 million and 23 million
respectively

valuation of investments the company has made equity investments in several
startup and early development stage companies among them ccx dgi and
hemerus the accounting treatment of each investment cost method or equity
method is dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to
the companys share in the equity of the investee and the companys ability to
exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee in determining which accounting treatment to apply the company must
make judgments based upon the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the
investment

the company periodically assesses its equity investments for impairment
development stage companies of the type the company has invested in are
dependent on their ability to raise additional funds to continue research and
development efforts and on receiving patent protection andor fda clearance to
market their products if such funding were unavailable or inadequate to fund
operations or if patent protection or fda clearance were not received the
company would potentially recognize an impairment loss to the extent of its
remaining net investment the companys net investment at june 30 2004 in ccx
and hemerus were 51 million and 29 million respectively during the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 the company determined that its investment in dgi was
other than temporarily impaired and wrote off the remaining net investment of
15 million

income taxes the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is
subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex
issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve the company
has received an audit assessment of 175 million plus interest from the
state of minnesota for fiscal years 2000 to 2003 the company has filed an
appeal with the minnesota department of revenue for abatement of the
assessment the company believes that the ultimate resolution of the matter
will not materially affect the consolidated financial position or operations of
the company in managements opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have
been made for all years presented

assessment of claims or pending litigation the company is routinely subject to
claims and involved in legal actions which are incidental to the business of
the company although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters management believes that any ultimate liability will not materially
affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
company as additional information becomes available the company will assess
the potential liabilities related to claims or pending litigation and revise
estimates as needed such revisions could materially impact the companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations


recent accounting pronouncements

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued
interpretation no 46 fin 46 consolidation of variable interest entities
fin 46 addresses the consolidation by businesses of variable interest entities
and requires businesses to consolidate a variable interest entity if it has a
variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses
if they occur or receive a majority of the entitys expected returns if they
occur or both fin 46 is effective for variable interest entities created
after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created prior to january
31 2003 the provisions of fin 46 were applicable to the company for the
quarter ended december 31 2003 the company assessed its relationships with
chemocentryx inc ccx and discovery genomics inc dgi and determined that
neither

                                       24

page

investment was required to be consolidated in the companys financial
statements pursuant to fin 46 in december 2003 the fasb revised fin 46 the
company was required to follow the revised fin 46 guidance effective for the
quarter ended march 31 2004 the company determined that none of the companys
investments in ccx dgi and the january 2004 investment in hemerus medical
llc are required to be consolidated in the companys financial statements
pursuant to the revised fin 46

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard
no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity which established standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain
financial instruments with characteristics of both debt and equity it requires
that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a
liability or an asset in some circumstances because that financial instrument
embodies an obligation of the issuer for example the statement requires
liability classification for a financial instrument issued in the form of
shares that are mandatorily redeemable eg includes an unconditional
obligation requiring the issuer to redeem it by transferring at a specified or
determinable date or dates or upon an event certain to occur sfas no 150 is
effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31
2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period
beginning after june 15 2003 the company has adopted sfas no 150 and it did
not have a significant impact on the companys financial statements


market risk

at the end of fiscal 2004 the company had an independently managed investment
portfolio of fixed income securities excluding those classified as cash and
cash equivalents of 1254 million see note a of notes to consolidated
financial statements these securities like all fixed income instruments are
subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest
rates increase

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially
adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes the company is exposed to
market risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro and the british
pound to the us dollar as the financial position and operating results of the
companys uk and german subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for
consolidation at the current level of rd europe operating results a 10
increase or decrease in the average exchange rate used to translate operating
results into us dollars would have an approximate 11 million effect on
consolidated operating income annually

the companys exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations also arises
from transferring funds from the uk subsidiary to the us subsidiary and from
transferring funds from the german subsidiary and french sales office to the
uk subsidiary at june 30 2004 and 2003 the company had 119000 and
358000 dollar denominated intercompany debt at its uk subsidiary and the
uk subsidiary had 93000 and 295000 dollar denominated intercompany debt
from its european operations these intercompany balances are revolving in
nature and are not deemed to be longterm balances the companys uk
subsidiary recognized net foreign currency gains of british pound36000
64000 british pound224000 356000 and british pound243000
352000 for the years ended june 30 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the
company does not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce its
exposure to foreign currency rate changes on intercompany foreign currency
denominated balance sheet positions

as of june 30 2004 the companys longterm debt consisted of a mortgage
note payable the interest rate on the mortgage was fixed at 7 through
november 2002 the terms of the note payable were modified in december 2002 to
include a floating interest rate at the one month london interbank offered rate
libor plus 25 with a floor of 4 the floating interest rate on the
mortgage note payable was below the 4 floor as of june 30 2004


forwardlooking information

statements in this annual report and elsewhere that are forwardlooking
involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results
of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected
and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed
below

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research
scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and

                                       25

page

government research institutions changes in spending on research by such
companies and in funding of such universities and institutions by government
including the national institutes of health affects the revenues and earnings
of the company the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and
changes in the level of orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations
in quarterly revenues and earnings

approximately one quarter of the companys sales are made through its
european subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign
currencies the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant
technological change while the hematology controls industry historically has
been less subject to rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted
significantly by changes in the automated testing equipment offered by
instrument manufacturers competitors of the company are numerous and include
among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument
and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical
companies universities and other research institutions there can be no
assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in developing
technologies and products that are more effective than any which have been or
are being developed by the company or that would render the companys
technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain
licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without
infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of
new products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies
developing new products related to the companys business and the acquisition
of companies for new products and additional customer base carry risks that
objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected
under the equity method of accounting a percentage of the losses of certain
companies in which the company invests will be reported as losses of the
company the company may not have control of the expense levels of such
companies and their losses may be greater than those anticipated by the
company additionally if the company determines that its investment in such
companies is other than temporarily impaired the company may write off its
entire investment in such company

ongoing research and development activities and the production and
marketing of certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by
numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries the
approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that
may be developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining
approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the
company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical to
the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require
the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by
existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could
adversely affect the companys business

overview

techne corporation the company is a holding company which has two wholly
owned operating subsidiaries  research and diagnostic systems inc rd
systems located in minneapolis minnesota and rd systems europe ltd rd
europe located in abingdon england  rd systems is a specialty
manufacturer of biological products  its two major operating segments are
hematology controls which are used in hospital and clinical laboratories to
check the accuracy of blood analysis instruments and biotechnology products
including purified proteins cytokines and antibodies which are sold
exclusively to the research market and assay kits which are sold to the
research and clinical diagnostic markets  rd europe distributes rd
systems biotechnology products in europe  rd europe has a german sales
subsidiary rd systems gmbh rd gmbh  the companys foreign sales
corporation techne export inc was dissolved in fiscal 2002

rd systems was founded and incorporated in 1976 in minneapolis minnesota
and was acquired by the company in 1985  in 1977 rd systems introduced its
first product a plateletrichplasma control  in 1981 rd systems was the
second manufacturer in the world to release a whole blood control with
platelets thereby establishing itself as one of the leaders in the field of
hematology control products manufacturing  subsequently rd systems has
developed several types of hematology controls designed to keep pace with the
technology of the newest models of hematology instruments  these products
are sold throughout the united states directly by rd systems and in many
foreign countries through distributors

in 1985 rd systems entered the research reagent market with its first
cytokine tgfbeta  cytokines are specialized protein molecules that
stimulate or suppress various cell functions in the body  cytokines are in
demand by biomedical researchers who want to learn more about their diverse
effects  encouraged by its success in the cytokine market rd systems
formed a biotechnology division in 1986 with the goal of producing and
marketing a wide range of human cytokines through genetic engineering
recombinant dna technology offers several advantages over extraction of these
proteins from natural sources including lower production cost and
potentially unlimited supply

in fiscal 1992 rd systems purchased amgen incs research reagent and
diagnostic assay kit business  with this purchase rd systems obtained
amgens erythropoietin epo kit the companys first enzymelinked
immunosorbent assay kit for a cytokine that had been cleared by the us food
and drug administration fda for clinical diagnostic use

in fiscal 1994 the company acquired its european biotechnology distributor
british biotechnology products ltd renamed rd systems europe ltd from
british biotechnology group plc  rd europe distributes  biotechnology
products developed and manufactured by rd systems

between fiscal 1998 and 2000 the company made equity investments in the
preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx a technology and drug
development company  the company currently holds approximately 26 of the
outstanding stock of ccx  in addition to the equity investment and joint
research efforts the company obtained research and diagnostic market rights
to all products discovered or developed by ccx

in fiscal 1999 rd systems purchased genzyme corporations research products
business  this acquisition established rd systems as the worlds leading
supplier of research and diagnostic cytokine products  included in cost of
sales for fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 were 23 million 18 million and 11
million respectively of royalties paid to genzyme under the purchase
agreement  the royalty agreement expired on june 30 2003

                                    3

in fiscal 2002 the company made an equity investment of 3 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi  dgi holds licenses from the university of minnesota to develop
technologies used for functional genomics and the discovery of druggable
targets  the company currently holds a 39 equity interest in dgi and also
received the rights to develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins
discovered by dgi and the rights to sell such products to the research
market


the market

the company through its two operating subsidiaries manufactures and sells
products for the clinical diagnostics market hematology controls and
calibrators and the biotechnology research and clinical diagnostics market
cytokines assays and related products  in fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 rd
systems hematology division revenues accounted for approximately 11 12
and 13 respectively of consolidated revenues  revenues from rd systems
biotechnology division were 63 65 and 64 and revenues from rd europe
were 26 23 and 23 of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2003 2002 and
2001 respectively

                        biotechnology products

rd systems is the worlds leading supplier of cytokines and cytokinerelated
reagents to the biotechnology research community  these valuable proteins
exist in minute amounts in different types of cells and can be extracted from
these cells or made through recombinant dna technology  in 1985 rd systems
introduced its first cytokine and continues to add to this product line  the
first cytokines were extracted from natural sources human and porcine
platelets and bovine brain  currently almost all of cytokines are produced
by recombinant dna technology  rd systems also sells antibodies for
specific cytokines cytokine assay kits clinical diagnostic kits kits for
cytokine receptor binding studies and related research reagents

the growing interest by researchers in cytokines exists because of the
profound effect a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on the cells and tissues
of the body  cytokines are intercellular messengers  they act as signals by
interacting with specific receptors on the effected cells  they carry vital
signals to the cells genetic machinery that can trigger events that can lead
to significant changes in a cell tissue or organism  for example cytokines
can signal a cell to differentiate ie to acquire the features necessary
for it to take on a more specialized task  another example of cytokine
action is the key role they play in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to
grow and divide and to attract migratory cells to the injury site

rd systems biotechnology division was formed in response to a growing need
for highly purified biologically active proteins  rd systems believes that
its cytokines are addressing the growing demand for these products within the
scientific research community

during fiscal 1990 the biotechnology division released its first cytokine
assay kits under the tradename quantikiner  these kits are used by
researchers to quantify the level of a specific cytokine in a sample of
blood serum or other biological fluid  in fiscal 1996 the biotechnology
division expanded its quantikine line by introducing a line of assay kits for
mouse cytokines and has subsequently released kits for other animal models
including rat and pig  these kits are used extensively by research
scientists doing cytokine studies using animal models such as those used in
pharmaceutical discovery and development programs

rd systems currently manufactures and sells over 5000 biotechnology
products

current biotechnology products

cytokines and related antibodies  cytokines extracted from natural
sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to
the highest purity  polyclonal antibodies are produced in animals
primarily goats and rabbits  the animals immune systems recognize the
cytokines as foreign and develop antibodies to these cytokines  the
polyclonal antibodies are then purified from the animals blood
monoclonal antibodies are produced by injecting purified cytokines into
mice  the b cells of a mouses immune system are then isolated and fused
with immortalized mouse cells that will produce the desired antibody
purified cytokines and antibodies are made available both as research
reagents and as parts of assay kits below

assay kits  this product line includes rd systems human murine mouse
and rat and porcine pig quantikine kits which allow research scientists
to quantify the amount of a specific cytokine in a sample of blood or
tissue  also included in this product line are assay kits developed by
rd europe to quantify adhesion molecules  these kits are used by
research scientists to measure cellular adhesion molecules in serum
plasma or cell culture media  cellular adhesion molecules facilitate the
movement of infection fighting cells out of the blood stream to the site
of infections

clinical diagnostic kits  the epo kit acquired from amgen inc in fiscal
1992 was the first diagnostic assay for which rd systems had fda
marketing clearance  rd systems also has received fda marketing
clearance for its transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin kits

flow cytometry products  this product line includes rd systems
fluorokine kits which are used to measure the presence or absence of
receptors for specific cytokines on the surface of cells

dna and related products  this diverse product line includes  primer
pairs which are synthetic dna used to amplify specific genes in the
laboratory messenger rna kits that allow researchers to quantitate the
amount of a specific cytokine messenger rna and reagents for the study of
dna damage and repair mechanisms in the cell

                     hematology controls and calibrators

hematology controls and calibrators manufactured and marketed through the
hematology division of rd systems are products made up of the various
cellular components of blood  proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a
thorough and accurate analysis of the patients blood cells which is usually
done with automatic or semiautomatic hematology instruments  controls and
calibrators ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and
reliably

blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of which is mainly water and
blood cells which are suspended in the plasma  there are three basic types
of blood cells  red cells white cells and platelets   red cells transport
oxygen from the lungs throughout the body which they do by being rich in
hemoglobin  white cells defend the body against foreign invaders  platelets
serve as a plug to stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a
complex series of biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot

the formed elements of blood red cells white cells and platelets differ a
great deal in size and concentration  the white cells are the largest in
size and platelets the smallest  the red cells are the most numerous and
constitute 95 percent of all blood cells  the average adult has from 20 to
30 trillion red cells  for every 500 red cells there are approximately one
white cell and about 20 platelets  as noted above hematology controls are
used in automatic and semiautomatic cell counting analyzers to make sure
these instruments are counting blood cells accurately  one of the most
frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is called a complete
blood count or cbc for short  doctors use this test in disease screening
and diagnosis  more than a billion of these tests are done every year the
great majority with cell counting instruments  in most laboratories the cbc
consists of the white cell count the red cell count the

                                      5
page

hemoglobin reading and the hematocrit reading or the percent of red cells in
a volume of whole blood after it has been centrifuged  also included in a
cbc test is the differential which numbers and classifies the different types
of white cells

these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be
measured by automatic or semiautomatic cell counters  cell counters can read
the parameters of blood either by impedance in which a cell interrupts an
electrical current and is counted or by a laser in which a cell interrupts
a laser beam and is counted  the number of parameters measurable in a blood
control product depends on the type and sophistication of the instrument for
which the control is designed  ordinarily a hematology control is used once
to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately
some instruments need to be calibrated periodically  hematology calibrators
are similar to controls but go through additional processing and testing to
ensure that the calibration values assigned are extremely accurate and can be
used to adjust the instrument

the hematology division of rd systems offers a complete line of hematology
controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters
rd systems believes its products have improved stability and versatility and
a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors  the hematology
division supplies hematology control products for use as proficiency testing
materials by laboratory certifying authorities of a number of states and
countries    rd systems recognizes that developing technologies for cell
counting instruments will require increasingly sophisticated and highquality
controls and is prepared to meet this challenge

products under development

rd systems is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its
major product lines  hematology controls and calibrators biotechnology
cytokines antibodies assays and related products  the company believes
that its future success depends to a large extent on the ability to keep
pace with changing technologies and markets  at the same time the company
continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality and
maximum economy

rd systems biotechnology division is planning to release new cytokines
antibodies and cytokine assay kits in the coming year  all of these products
will be for research purposes only and therefore do not require fda
clearance  rd systems hematology division has developed several new
control products in fiscal 2003 and is continuously working on product
improvements and enhancements  however there is no assurance that any of
the products in the research and development phase can be developed or if
developed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

convertible preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx which gave the
company a 49 interest in ccx through january 2001  in february 2001 ccx
obtained 23 million in financing through the issuance of 8846154 shares of
additional preferred stock  the company currently holds approximately 26 of
the outstanding voting stock of ccx  ccx is a technology and drug
development company working in the area of chemokines  chemokines are
cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of leukocytes the effector
cells of the human immune system  in conjunction with the equity investment
and joint research efforts the company obtained exclusive worldwide research
and diagnostic marketing rights to chemokine proteins antibodies and
receptors discovered or developed by ccx or rd systems  the company
accounts for the investment under the equity method of accounting and
through january 2001 recognized 100 of the losses of ccx due to the limited
amount of cash consideration provided by the holders of the common shares of
ccx  subsequent to january 2001 the company is including ccx operating
results in its consolidated financial statements based on its ownership
percentage  the companys net investment in ccx was 2511023 and
5091046 at june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively

original equipment manufacturer oem agreements represent the largest market
for hematology controls and calibrators made by rd systems  in fiscal 2003
2002 and 2001 oem contracts accounted for 7153518 7609425 and
7096901 respectively or 5 6 and 6 of total consolidated revenues


government regulation

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under
the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended  all of rd systems
hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products
by the fda  the entire hematology control manufacturing process from
receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their
expiration date is strictly regulated and documented  fda inspectors make
periodic site inspections of the hematology divisions control operations and
facilities  hematology control manufacturing must comply with good
manufacturing practices gmp as set forth in the fdas regulations governing
medical devices

three of rd systems immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin
have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use  rd systems must
comply with gmp for the manufacture of these kits  biotechnology products
manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do
not require fda clearance

some of rd systems research groups use small amounts of radioactive
materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development
activities  thus rd systems is subject to regulation by the us nuclear
regulatory commission nrc and has been granted an nrc license due to expire
in april 2004  the license is renewable annually  rd systems is also
subject to regulation and inspection by the department of health of the state
of minnesota for its use of radioactive materials  it has been granted a
certificate of registration which is renewable annually by the minnesota
department of health  the current certificate expires april 1 2004  rd
systems has had no difficulties in renewing these licenses in prior years and
has no reason to believe they will not be renewed in the future  if
however the licenses were not renewed it would have minimal effect on rd
systems business since there are other technologies the research groups
could use to replace radioisotopes


availability of raw materials

the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole
blood  human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks and porcine and
bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants  after raw
blood is received it is separated into its components processed and
stabilized  although the cost of human blood has increased owing largely to
the requirement that it be tested for certain diseases the higher cost of
these materials has not had a serious adverse effect on the companys
business  rd systems does not perform its own testing as the supplier tests
all human blood purchased  rd systems biotechnology division develops and
manufactures the majority of its cytokines from synthetic genes developed in
house thus significantly reducing its reliance on outside resources  rd
systems typically has several outside sources for all critical raw materials
necessary for the manufacture of products


patents and trademarks

rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls  rd
systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it
manufactures  no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will
be obtained  no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not
infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others
particularly for genetically engineered products

                                       8
page

rd systems has not conducted a patent infringement study for each of its
products  see item 3 legal proceedings below

rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent
holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to patented technology
or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine
and cytokine related products to the research market  for fiscal 2003 2002
and 2001 total royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately
2273000 2143000 and 1563000 respectively

rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its
hematology controls and biotechnology product groups  rd systems believes
it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those
which it has registered


seasonality of business

sales of products by rd systems and rd europe particularly rd europe
historically experience a slowing of sales or of the rate of sales growth
during the summer months  rd systems also usually experiences a slowing of
sales during the thanksgiving to new year holiday period  the company
believes this slowing is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan
and of academic schedules in the united states


significant customers

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during
fiscal 2003 2002 or 2001


backlog

there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of
the date of this report or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2002  the
majority of the companys biotechnology products are shipped within one day
of receipt of the customers order  the majority of hematology products are
shipped based on a preset recurring schedule


competition

the worldwide market for cytokines and research diagnostic assay kits is
being supplied by a number of biotechnology companies including bd
biosciences biosource international peprotech inc sigma chemical co
amersham pharmacia and emd biosciences inc  rd systems believes that it is
the leading worldwide supplier of cytokine related products in the research
marketplace  rd systems believes that the expanding line of its products
their recognized quality and the growing demand for these rare and versatile
proteins antibodies and assay kits will allow the company to remain
competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market

competition is intense in the hematology control business  the first control
products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic
instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell
counting  historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made
controls for use in their own instruments  with rapid expansion of the
instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled non
instrument manufacturers to gain a foothold  today the market is comprised
of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products
and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument
manufacturers  the principal hematology control competitors of

the company wishes to caution investors that the following important factors
among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the
companys actual results of operations and cause such results to differ
materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements made in this
document and elsewhere by or on behalf of the company

technological obsolescence and competition

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change  while the hematology controls industry historically has been subject
to less rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by hardware manufacturers
competitors of the company in the united states and abroad are numerous and
include among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory
instrument and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major
pharmaceutical companies universities and other research institutions
there can be no assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in
developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which
have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the
companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive  many of
these competitors have substantially greater resources and product
development production and marketing capabilities than the company  with
regard to diagnostic kits which constitute a relatively minor portion of the
companys business many of the companys competitors have significantly
greater experience than the company in undertaking preclinical testing and
clinical trials of new or improved diagnostic kits and obtaining fda and
other regulatory approvals of such products

research spending

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research
scientists at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university
and government research institutions  changes in spending on research by
such companies and in funding of such universities and institutions by
government including the national institutes of health affect the revenues
and earnings of the company  the companys biotechnology division carries
essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of orders received
and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues and earnings

foreign currency exchange rates

approximately one quarter of the companys sales are made through its
european subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign
currencies  the companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by
fluctuations in currency exchange rates

patents and proprietary rights

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others  the company has filed a very limited
number of united states and foreign patent applications for products in which
it believes it has a proprietary interest  the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others  the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products  it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company  the patenting of hematology and biotechnology
processes and products involves complex legal and factual questions and to
date there has emerged no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims
in biotechnology patents

protracted and costly litigation may be necessary to enforce rights of the
company and defend against claims of infringement of rights of others  see








                              item 2  properties

the company owns the facilities its rd systems subsidiary occupies in
minneapolis minnesota  the rd systems complex currently includes 365000
square feet of administrative research and manufacturing space  the
hematology division manufacturing and shipping operations are located at 640
mckinley place ne 47000 square feet biotechnology division

85000 square feet and 2201 kennedy street 200000 square feet
administrative sales and marketing functions are also located at the 2201
kennedy street building the company also occupies an additional 20000
square feet in space connecting the three buildings  this area houses a
lunchroom a library and warehouse space in addition the company
constructed a 13000 square foot entrance to the facility

in march 2002 the company purchased property adjacent to its minneapolis
facility for approximately 89 million  the company has begun to renovate
this property and when complete planned for fiscal 2004 the building will
add approximately 176000 square feet of space  the company plans to lease
out approximately 70 of the building as retail and office space and use the
remainder as warehouse and storage space  the company has begun construction
on an infill to connect this building to its current facility  the 78000
square foot infill planned to be completed in fiscal 2004 will be used
primarily for laboratory space

the company has entered into an option agreement for additional real estate
adjacent to the current facility  this option is exerciable through january
2005

in december 2002 the company purchased approximately 649 acres of farmland
including buildings in southeast minnesota for 27 million  a portion of
the land and buildings are being leased to third parties as cropland and for
a dairy operation  rental income from the property was 72000 in fiscal
2003  the remaining property will be used by the company to house goats used
for polyclonal antibody production  building construction of approximately
16 million is planned for this site in fiscal 2004

rd europe leases approximately 17000 square feet in a building in abingdon
england  base rent was 405000 in fiscal 2003

rd gmbh leases approximately 2300 square feet as a sales office in
wiesbadennordenstadt germany  base rent was 33000 in fiscal 2003

the company believes the acquired property purchase option and leased
property discussed above are adequate to meet its occupancy needs in the
foreseeable future


                       item 3  legal proceedings

on june 13 2003 the company submitted to the us patent and trademark
office pto a request for interference to initiate an action between the
company and streck laboratories inc regarding certain patents issued to
streck  the streck patents relate to the addition of reticulocytes to
hematology controls  the company has reason to believe that it invented the
inventions claimed in the streck patents before streck and is seeking a
decision by the pto that the company is entitled to a patent covering the
inventions and that the streck patent is invalid

item 3 legal proceedings below

financial impact of expansion strategy

the company engages in an expansion strategy which includes internal
development of new products collaboration with manufacturers of automated
instruments which may use the companys products investment in joint
ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys
business and acquisition of companies for new products or additional customer
base  each of the strategies carries risks that objectives will not be
achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected  during the early
development stage under the equity method of accounting a percentage of the
losses of certain companies in which the company may invest will be reported
as losses of the company as is the case with chemocentryx inc and
discovery genomics inc  the company may not have control of the expense
levels of such companies and their losses may be greater than those
anticipated by the company

government regulation

ongoing research and development activities including preclinical and
clinical testing and the production and marketing of certain of the
companys products are subject to regulation by numerous governmental
authorities in the united states and other countries  some of the companys
products and manufacturing processes and facilities require governmental
approval prior to commercial use  the approval process applicable to
clinical diagnostic products of the type which may be developed by the
company may take a year or more  delays in obtaining regulatory approvals
would adversely affect the marketing of products developed by the company and
the companys ability to receive product revenues or royalties  there can be
no assurance that regulatory approvals for such products will be obtained
without lengthy delays if at all

attraction and retention of key employees

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing is critical
to the companys success  although the company believes it has been and will
be able to attract and retain such personnel there can be no assurance that
the company will be successful  in addition the companys anticipated
growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional
expertise such as clinical testing government approvals production and
marketing will require the addition of new management personnel and the
development of additional expertise by existing management personnel  the
failure to attract and retain such personnel or to develop such expertise
would adversely affect the companys business

          item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial
                   condition and results of operations

company structure

techne corporation the company has two operating subsidiaries research
and diagnostic systems inc rd systems and rd systems europe ltd
rd europe rd systems located in minneapolis minnesota has two
operating segments its biotechnology division and its hematology division
the biotechnology division develops and manufactures purified cytokines
proteins antibodies and assay kits which are sold to biomedical researchers
and clinical research laboratories the hematology division develops and
manufactures whole blood hematology controls and calibrators which are sold
to hospitals and clinical laboratories to check the performance of hematology
instruments to assure the accuracy of hematology test results rd europe the
companys third operating segment located in abingdon england is the
european distributor of rd systems biotechnology products rd europe has a
german sales subsidiary rd systems gmbh the companys foreign sales
corporation techne export inc was dissolved in fiscal 2002


critical accounting policies

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and
results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis
management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are
not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these
estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its
business operations and an understanding of results of operations the
listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting
policies

valuation of accounts receivable  the company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment
history and the customers current creditworthiness as determined by
managements review of their current credit information the company
continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and
maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the companys
historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have
been identified while such credit losses have historically been within the
companys established provisions if the financial condition of the
companys customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their
ability to make payments additional allowances may be required

valuation of inventory  inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin
firstout method or market the company regularly reviews inventories on hand
for slowmoving and obsolete inventory inventory not meeting quality control
standards and inventory subject to expiration the manufacturing process for
proteins and antibodies has and may continue to produce quantities in excess of
forecasted usage individual protein and antibody sales volumes can be volatile
and the company believes that forecasting sales volumes for individual products
beyond a twoyear period is highly

                                  16
page

uncertain as a result the company values its manufactured protein and
antibody inventory based on a twoyear sales forecast any significant
unanticipated changes in product demand or market conditions could have an
impact on the value of inventories and the change in value would be reflected
in cost of sales in the period of the change

income taxes  the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is
subject to audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex
issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve in managements
opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years
presented

assessment of claims or pending litigation  the company is routinely subject to
claims and involved in legal actions which are incidental to the business of the
company although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these
matters management believes that any ultimate liability will not materially
affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
company as additional information becomes available the company will assess
the potential liabilities related to claims or pending litigation and revise
estimates as needed such revisions could materially impact the companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations


results of operations

net sales for fiscal 2003 were 145010900 an increase of 14110505 11
from fiscal 2002 net sales by rd systems biotechnology division for the
period increased 6309833 7 net sales by rd systems hematology division
increased 1095382 7 and net sales by rd europe increased 6705290
22 rd europes net sales for fiscal 2003 were affected by changes in
foreign currency exchange rates in british pounds rd europes net sales
increased 11 from the prior year the increase in consolidated net sales for
the fiscal year was due largely to increased sales of proteins and antibodies

net sales for fiscal 2002 were 130900395 an increase of 15543833 13
from fiscal 2001 net sales by rd systems biotechnology division for the
period increased 10998256 15 net sales by rd systems hematology
division increased 860192 6 and net sales by rd europe increased
3685385 14 the increase in consolidated net sales for the fiscal year
was due largely to increased sales of proteins and antibodies

gross margins as a percentage of net sales increased slightly from 752 in
fiscal 2002 to 756 in fiscal 2003 biotechnology division gross margins
decreased slightly from 792 to 790 hematology division gross margins
increased from 450 to 472 in fiscal 2003 as a result of lower raw material
costs blood costs increased significantly during the prior year as a result of
a decreased blood supply but returned to a more normal level by the end of
fiscal 2002 rd europe gross margins increased from 361 to 418 in fiscal
2003 mainly as a result of favorable exchange rates due to the weakening of
the us dollar to the british pound sterling

gross margins as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly from 754 in
fiscal 2001 to 752 in fiscal 2002 biotechnology division gross margins
increased from 786 to 792 in fiscal 2002 as a result of increased
manufacturing efficiencies hematology division gross margins decreased from
467 to 450 in fiscal 2002 as a result of higher raw material costs as
discussed above rd europe gross margins decreased from 383 to 361 in
fiscal 2002 mainly as a result of changes in exchange rates

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 422683 2 in fiscal
2003 and increased 2438042 14 in fiscal 2002 the decrease in selling
general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2003 was a direct result of a
12 million decrease in profit sharing and stock bonus contributions from the
prior year due to sales and profit targets not being met this decrease was
partially offset by a 751000 increase in wages and benefits the increase in
fiscal 2002 was due to increased wages and benefits 903000 profit sharing
and stock bonus contributions 442000 and legal expenses 373000 from
fiscal 2001

research and development expenses increased 3111076 and 2948034 in fiscal

exclusive of ccx and dgi research and development expenses by the company
increased 1778624 and 1592271 in fiscal 2003 and 2002 respectively
these increases were primarily the result of the development and release of
new cytokines antibodies and assay kits by rd systems biotechnology
division and the development and release of several new hematology division
control products

amortization of intangible assets on july 1 2002 the company adopted
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets under which goodwill is no longer amortized goodwill

systems biotechnology division earnings increased 10714234 rd systems
hematology division earnings increased 843416 and rd europe earnings
increased 3817858 these increases in earnings were due mainly to increased
sales and decreased goodwill amortization of 627 million and were partially
offset by increased losses of 1332425 by ccx and dgi included in the
companys results

earnings before taxes decreased from 47808376 in fiscal 2001 to 37735669
in fiscal 2002 the decrease was the result of the litigation settlement

included in the companys results

income taxes for fiscal 2003 2002 and 2001 were provided at rates of
approximately 35 28 and 29 respectively the increased tax rate in fiscal
2003 was primarily the result of changes in minnesota income tax regulations
which resulted in state tax expense of 666000 1552000 expense offset by
886000 of tax credit carryforwards in fiscal 2003 compared to a credit of
1 million in fiscal 2002 the tax rate in fiscal 2001 includes the effect of
a onetime 12 million credit as a result of the closeout of pending issues
related to a state income tax examination for fiscal years 1996 through 1999
us federal and state taxes have been reduced as a result of taxexempt
interest income the benefit of extraterritorial income in fiscal 2003 and 2002
the benefit of the foreign sales corporation in fiscal 2001 and the federal and
state credit for research and development expenditures foreign income taxes
have been provided at rates which approximate the tax rates in the countries in
which rd europe operates without significant business developments the
company expects income tax rates for fiscal 2004 to be from 35 to 36

forwardlooking information

statements in this annual report and elsewhere that are forwardlooking
involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results of
operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected and in
the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed below

the companys biotechnology products are sold primarily to research scientists
at pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and at university and government
research institutions changes in spending on research by such companies and in
funding of such universities and institutions by government including the
national institutes of health affects the revenues and earnings of the company
the company carries essentially no backlog of orders and changes in the level of
orders received and filled daily can cause fluctuations in quarterly revenues
and earnings

approximately one quarter of the companys sales are made through its european
subsidiary rd systems europe which makes its sales in foreign currencies the
companys revenues and earnings are therefore affected by fluctuations in
currency exchange rates

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change while the hematology controls industry historically has been subject to
less rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by changes
in the automated testing equipment offered by hardware manufacturers
competitors of the company are numerous and include among others specialized
biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument and equipment manufacturers
and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical companies universities and
other research institutions there can be no assurance that the companys
competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are
more effective than any which have been or are being developed by the company or
that would render the companys technologies and products obsolete or
noncompetitive

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the
proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is negotiating
licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products claimed to be
owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement study
for each of its products it is possible that products of the company may
unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may have
to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain
activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing additional
unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse effect on the
company

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of new
products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies developing
new products related to the companys business and the acquisition of companies
for new products and additional customer base carry risks that objectives will
not be achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected during the early
development stage under the equity method of accounting a percentage of the
losses of certain companies in which the company invests will be reported as
losses of the company the company may not have control of the expense levels of
such companies and their losses may be greater than those anticipated by the
company

ongoing research and development activities and the production and marketing of
certain of the companys products are subject to regulation by numerous
governmental authorities in the united states and other countries the approval
process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the type that may be
developed by the company may take a year or more delays in obtaining approvals
could adversely affect the marketing of new products developed by the company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical to
the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will require
the addition of new personnel and the development of additional expertise by
existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such personnel could
adversely affect the companys business

for additional information on risks and uncertainties see the companys
periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission

          item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures
                         about market risk

at the end of fiscal 2003 the company had a professionally managed
investment portfolio of fixed income securities excluding those classified
as cash and cash equivalents of 78130269 see note a of notes to
consolidated financial statements these securities like all fixed income
instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if
market interest rates increase

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially
adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes the company is exposed to
market risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the euro and the
british pound to the us dollar as the financial position and operating
results of the companys uk and german subsidiaries are translated into
us dollars for consolidation the companys exposure to foreign exchange
rate fluctuations also arises from transferring funds from the uk
subsidiary to the us parent and from transferring funds from the german
subsidiary to the uk subsidiary at june 30 2003 and 2002 the company had
358195 and 397349 dollar denominated intercompany debt at its uk
subsidiary and the uk subsidiary had 295242 and 37291 dollar
denominated intercompany debt at its german subsidiary these intercompany
balances are revolving in nature and are not deemed to be longterm balances
the companys uk subsidiary recognized net foreign currency gains of
223938 pounds 356554 and 242614 pounds 351548 for the years ended
june 30 2003 and 2002 respectively the currency gains were primarily the
result of a strong british pound compared to the euro the company does not
enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce its exposure to
foreign currency rate changes on intercompany foreign currency denominated
balance sheet positions

as of june 30 2003 the companys longterm debt consisted of a
mortgage note payable the interest rate on the mortgage was fixed at 7
through november 2002 the terms of the note payable were modified in
december 2002 to include a floating interest rate at the one month london
interbank offered rate libor plus 25 with a floor of 4 the floating
interest rate on the mortgage note payable was below the 4 floor as of june
30 2003

                             item 1  business

overview

techne corporation the company is a holding company which has two wholly
owned operating subsidiaries  research and diagnostic systems inc rd
systems located in minneapolis minnesota and rd systems europe ltd rd
europe located in abingdon england  rd systems is a specialty
manufacturer of biological products  its two major operating segments are
hematology controls which are used in hospital and clinical laboratories to
check the accuracy of blood analysis instruments and biotechnology products
including purified proteins cytokines and antibodies which are sold
exclusively to the research market and assay kits which are sold to the
research and clinical diagnostic markets  rd europe distributes rd
systems biotechnology products in europe  rd europe has a german sales
subsidiary rd systems gmbh rd gmbh  the company also had a foreign
sales corporation techne export inc which was dissolved in fiscal 2002

rd systems was founded and incorporated in 1976 in minneapolis minnesota
and was acquired by the company in 1985  in 1977 rd systems introduced its
first product a plateletrichplasma control  in 1981 rd systems was the
second manufacturer in the world to release a whole blood control with
platelets thereby establishing itself as one of the leaders in the field of
hematology control products manufacturing  subsequently rd systems has
developed several types of hematology controls designed to keep pace with the
technology of the newest models of hematology instruments  these products
are sold throughout the united states directly by rd systems and in many
foreign countries through distributors

in 1985 rd systems entered the research reagent market with its first
cytokine tgfbeta  cytokines are specialized protein molecules that
stimulate or suppress various cell functions in the body  cytokines are in
demand by biomedical researchers who want to learn more about their diverse
effects  encouraged by its success in the cytokine market rd systems
formed a biotechnology division in 1986 with the goal of producing and
marketing a wide range of human cytokines through genetic engineering
recombinant dna technology offers several advantages over extraction of these
proteins from natural sources including lower production cost and
potentially unlimited supply

in fiscal 1992 rd systems purchased amgen incs research reagent and
diagnostic assay kit business  with this purchase rd systems obtained
amgens erythropoietin epo kit the companys first enzymelinked
immunosorbent assay kit for a cytokine that had been cleared by the us food
and drug administration fda for clinical diagnostic use

in fiscal 1994 the company acquired its european biotechnology distributor
british biotechnology products ltd renamed rd systems europe ltd from
british biotechnology group plc  rd europe distributes  biotechnology
products developed and manufactured by rd systems

during fiscal 1998 1999 and 2000 the company made equity investments in
the preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx a technology and drug
development company  the company currently holds approximately 26 of the
outstanding stock of ccx  in addition to the equity investment and joint
research efforts the company obtained research and diagnostic market rights
to all products discovered or developed by ccx

in fiscal 1999 rd systems purchased genzyme corporations research products
business  this acquisition established rd systems as the worlds leading
supplier of research and diagnostic cytokine products

in fiscal 2002 the company made an equity investment of 3 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi  dgi holds licenses from the university of minnesota to develop
technologies used for functional genomics and the discovery of druggable
targets  the company currently holds a 39 equity interest in dgi and also
received the rights to develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins
discovered by dgi and the rights to sell such products to the research
market


the market

the company through its two operating subsidiaries manufactures and sells
products for the clinical diagnostics market hematology controls and
calibrators and the biotechnology research and clinical diagnostics market
cytokines assays and related products  in fiscal 2002 rd systems
hematology division revenues accounted for approximately 12 of consolidated
revenues of 130900395  revenues from rd systems biotechnology division
and rd europe were 65 and 23 of consolidated revenues respectively

                        biotechnology products

rd systems is the worlds leading supplier of cytokines and cytokinerelated
reagents to the biotechnology research community  these valuable proteins
exist in minute amounts in different types of cells and can be extracted from
these cells or made through recombinant dna technology  in 1985 rd systems
introduced its first cytokine and continues to add to this product line  the
first cytokines were extracted from natural sources human and porcine
platelets and bovine brain  currently almost all of cytokines are produced
by recombinant dna technology  rd systems also sells antibodies for
specific cytokines cytokine assay kits clinical diagnostic kits kits for
cytokine receptor binding studies and related research reagents

the growing interest by researchers in cytokines exists because of the
profound effect a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on the cells and tissues
of the body  cytokines are intercellular messengers  they act as signals by
interacting with specific receptors on the effected cells  they carry vital
signals to the cells genetic machinery that can trigger events that can lead
to significant changes in a cell tissue or organism  for example cytokines
can signal a cell to differentiate ie to acquire the features necessary
for it to take on a more specialized task  another example of cytokine
action is the key role they play in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to
grow and divide and to attract migratory cells to the injury site

rd systems biotechnology division was formed in response to a growing need
for highly purified biologically active proteins  rd systems believes that
its cytokines are addressing the growing demand for these products within the
scientific research community

during fiscal 1990 the biotechnology division released its first cytokine
assay kits under the tradename quantikine  these kits are used by
researchers to quantify the level of a specific cytokine in a sample of
blood serum or other biological fluid  in fiscal 1996 the biotechnology
division expanded its quantikine line by introducing a line of assay kits for
mouse cytokines and has subsequently released kits for other animal models
including rat and pig  these kits are used extensively by research
scientists doing cytokine studies using animal models such as those used in
pharmaceutical discovery and development programs

current biotechnology products

cytokines and related antibodies  cytokines extracted from natural
sources or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to
the highest purity  polyclonal antibodies are produced by injecting
purified cytokines into animals primarily goats and rabbits  the
animals immune systems recognize the cytokines as foreign and develop
antibodies to these cytokines  the polyclonal antibodies are then
extracted from the animals blood and purified  monoclonal antibodies are
produced by injecting purified cytokines into mice  the b cells of a
mouses immune system are then isolated and fused with immortalized mouse
cells that will produce the desired antibody  purified cytokines and
antibodies are made available both as research reagents and as parts of
assay kits below

assay kits  this product line includes rd systems human murine mouse
and rat and porcine pig quantikine kits which allow research scientists
to quantify the amount of a specific cytokine in a sample of blood or
tissue  also included in this product line are assay kits developed by
rd europe to quantify adhesion molecules  these kits are used by
research scientists to measure cellular adhesion molecules in serum
plasma or cell culture media  cellular adhesion molecules facilitate the
movement of infection fighting cells out of the blood stream to the site
of infections

clinical diagnostic kits  the epo kit acquired from amgen inc in fiscal
1992 was the first diagnostic assay for which rd systems had fda
marketing clearance  rd systems also has received fda marketing
clearance for its transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin kits

flow cytometry products  this product line includes rd systems
fluorokine kits which are used to measure the presence or absence of
receptors for specific cytokines on the surface of cells

dna and related products  designer genes and designer probes are
synthetic dnas used in the study of gene function


                      hematology controls and calibrators

hematology controls and calibrators manufactured and marketed through the
hematology division of rd systems are products made up of the various
cellular components of blood  proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a
thorough and accurate analysis of the patients blood cells which is usually
done with automatic or semiautomatic hematology instruments  controls and
calibrators ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and
reliably

blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of which is mainly water and
blood cells which are suspended in the plasma  there are three basic types
of blood cells  red cells white cells and platelets   red cells transport
oxygen from the lungs throughout the body which they do by being rich in
hemoglobin  white cells defend the body against foreign invaders  platelets
serve as a plug to stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a
complex series of biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot

the formed elements of blood red cells white cells and platelets differ a
great deal in size and concentration  the white cells are the largest in
size and platelets the smallest  the red cells are the most numerous and
constitute 95 percent of all blood cells  the average adult has from 20 to
30 trillion red cells  for every 500 red cells there are approximately one
white cell and about 20 platelets  as noted above hematology controls are
used in automatic and semiautomatic cell counting analyzers to make sure
these instruments are counting blood cells accurately  one of the most
frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is called a complete
blood count or cbc for short  doctors use this test in disease screening
and diagnosis  more than a billion of these tests are done every year the
great majority with cell counting instruments  in most laboratories the cbc
consists of the white cell count the red cell count the hemoglobin reading
and the hematocrit reading or the percent of red cells in a volume of whole
blood after it has been centrifuged  also included in a cbc test is the
differential which numbers and classifies the different types of white cells

these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be
measured by automatic or semiautomatic cell counters  cell counters can read
the parameters of blood either by impedance in which a cell interrupts an
electrical current and is counted or by a laser in which a cell interrupts
a laser beam and is counted  the number of parameters measurable in a blood
control product depends on the type and sophistication of the instrument for
which the control is designed  ordinarily a hematology control is used once
to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately
some instruments need to be calibrated periodically  hematology calibrators
are similar to controls but go through additional processing and testing to
ensure that the calibration values assigned are extremely accurate and can be
used to adjust the instrument

the hematology division of rd systems offers a complete line of hematology
controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters
rd systems believes its products have improved stability and versatility and
a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors  the hematology
division supplies hematology control products for use as proficiency testing
materials by laboratory certifying authorities of a number of states and
countries  all products are priced competitively and come with an
unconditional money back guarantee  rd systems recognizes that developing
technologies for cell counting instruments will require increasingly
sophisticated and highquality controls and is prepared to meet this
challenge

products under development

rd systems is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its
major product lines  hematology controls and calibrators biotechnology
cytokines antibodies assays and related products  the company believes
that its future success depends to a large extent on the ability to keep
pace with changing technologies and markets  at the same time the company
continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality and
maximum economy

rd systems biotechnology division is planning to release new cytokines
antibodies and cytokine assay kits in the coming year  all of these products
will be for research purposes only and therefore do not require fda
clearance  rd systems hematology division has developed several new
control products in fiscal 2002 and is continuously working on product
improvements and enhancements  however there is no assurance that any of
the products in the research and development phase can be developed or if
developed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

expenditures for research and development activities were 17470267
14522233 and 11198309 for fiscal year 2002 2001 and 2000
respectively


business relationships

during fiscal 1998 1999 and 2000 the company purchased a total of 5
million of convertible preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx which
gave the company a 49 interest in ccx through january 2001  in february
2001 ccx obtained 23 million in financing through the issuance of 8846154
shares of  additional preferred stock  the company currently holds
approximately 26 of the outstanding voting stock of ccx  ccx is a
technology and drug development company working in the area of chemokines
chemokines are cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of
leukocytes the effector cells of the human immune system  in conjunction
with the equity investment and joint research efforts the company obtained
exclusive worldwide research and diagnostic marketing rights to chemokine
proteins antibodies and receptors discovered or developed by ccx or rd
systems  the company accounts for the investment under the equity method of
accounting and through january 2001 recognized 100 of the losses of ccx
due to the limited amount of cash consideration provided by the holders of
the common shares of ccx  subsequent to january 2001 the company is
including ccx operating results in its consolidated financial statements
based on its ownership percentage  the companys net investment in ccx was
5091046 and 6441481 at june 30 2002 and 2001 respectively

on august 2 2001 the company made an equity investment of 3 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi of minneapolis minnesota  dgi holds licenses from the university of
minnesota to develop technologies used for functional genomics and the
discovery of druggable targets  the company acquired a 39 equity interest
in dgi and warrants to acquire additional equity  the company also received
the rights to develop antibodies and immunoassay kits for proteins discovered
by dgi and an exclusive royalty free license to sell such products in the
research market  the companys investment is accounted for under the equity
method of accounting  the companys net investment in dgi was 2494985 at
june 30 2002

original equipment manufacturers oem agreements represent the largest
market for hematology controls and calibrators made by rd systems  in
fiscal 2002 oem contracts accounted for 7609435 or 49 of hematology
division revenues and 6 of total consolidated revenues


government regulation

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under
the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended  all of rd systems
hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products
by the fda  the entire hematology control manufacturing process from
receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their
expiration date is strictly regulated and documented  fda inspectors make
periodic site inspections of the hematology divisions control operations and
facilities  hematology control manufacturing must comply with good
manufacturing practices gmp as set forth in the fdas regulations governing
medical devices

three of rd systems immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin
have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use  rd systems must
comply with gmp for the manufacture of these kits  biotechnology products
manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do
not require fda clearance

some of rd systems research groups use small amounts of radioactive
materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development
activities  thus rd systems is subject to regulation by the us nuclear
regulatory commission nrc and has been granted an nrc license due to expire
in april 2003  the license is renewable annually  rd systems is also
subject to regulation and inspection by the department of health of the state
of minnesota for its use of radioactive materials  it has been granted a
certificate of registration which is renewable annually by the minnesota
department of health  the current certificate expires april 1 2003  rd
systems has had no difficulties in renewing these licenses in prior years and
has no reason to believe they will not be renewed in the future  if
however the licenses were not renewed it would have minimal effect on rd
systems business since there are other technologies the research groups
could use to replace radioisotopes


availability of raw materials

the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole
blood  human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks and porcine and
bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants  after raw
blood is received it is separated into its components processed and
stabilized  although the cost of human blood has increased owing largely to
the requirement that it be tested for hiv aids antibodies and hepatitis
the higher cost of these materials has not had a serious adverse effect on
the companys business  rd systems does not perform its own testing for the
aids antibodies as the supplier tests all human blood purchased  rd
systems biotechnology division develops and manufactures the majority of its
cytokines from synthetic genes developed inhouse thus significantly
reducing its reliance on outside resources  rd systems typically has
several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the
manufacture of products


patents and trademarks

rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls  rd
systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it
manufactures  no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will
be obtained  no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not
infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others
particularly for genetically engineered products rd systems has not
conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products

rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent
holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to patented technology
or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine
and cytokine related products to the research market  for fiscal 2002 total
royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 2143000

rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its
hematology controls and biotechnology product groups  rd systems believes
it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those
which it has registered


seasonality of business

sales of the products manufactured by rd systems and rd europe
particularly rd europe historically experience a slowing of sales or of the
rate of sales growth during the summer months  the company believes this
slowing is a result of vacation schedules in europe and japan and of academic
schedules in the united states


significant customers

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during
fiscal 2002 2001 or 2000


backlog

there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of
the date of this report or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2001


competition

the worldwide market for cytokines and research diagnostic assay kits is
being supplied by a number of biotechnology companies including bd
biosciences biosource international peprotech inc sigma chemical co
amersham pharmacia and cn biosciences  rd systems believes that it is the
leading worldwide supplier of cytokine related products in the research
marketplace  rd systems believes that the expanding line of its products
their recognized quality and the growing demand for these rare and versatile
proteins antibodies and assay kits will allow the company to remain
competitive in the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market

competition is intense in the hematology control business  the first control
products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic
instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell
counting  historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made
controls for use in their own instruments  with rapid expansion of the
instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled non
instrument manufacturers to gain a foothold  today the market is comprised
of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products
and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument
manufacturers  the principal hematology control competitors of rd systems
retail products are beckman coulter inc toa sysmex streck laboratories
abbott diagnostics and hematronix inc  rd systems believes it is the third
largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman
coulter and streck laboratories


employees

rd systems had 460 fulltime and 48 parttime employees as of june 30 2002
rd europe had 49 fulltime and 9 parttime employees as of june 30 2002
including 10 fulltime and 1 parttime at rd europes sales subsidiary in
germany


environment

compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws in the
united states england and germany had no material effect on rd systems or
rd europe in fiscal 2002

cautionary statements

the company wishes to caution investors that the following important factors
among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the
companys actual results of operations and cause such results to differ
materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements made in this
document and elsewhere by or on behalf of the company

risk of technological obsolescence and competition

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change  while the hematology controls industry historically has been subject
to less rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by hardware manufacturers
competitors of the company in the united states and abroad are numerous and
include among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory
instrument and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major
pharmaceutical companies universities and other research institutions
there can be no assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in
developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which
have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the
companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive  many of
these competitors have substantially greater resources and product
development production and marketing capabilities than the company  with
regard to diagnostic kits which constitute a relatively minor portion of the
companys business many of the companys competitors have significantly
greater experience than the company in undertaking preclinical testing and
clinical trials of new or improved diagnostic kits and obtaining fda and
other regulatory approvals of such products

patents and proprietary rights

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others  the company has filed a very limited
number of united states and foreign patent applications for products in which
it believes it has a proprietary interest  the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others  the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products  it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company  the patenting of hematology and biotechnology
processes and products involves complex legal and factual questions and to
date there has emerged no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims
in biotechnology patents  protracted and costly litigation may be necessary
to enforce rights of the company and defend against claims of infringement of
rights of others

financial impact of expansion strategy

the company engages in an expansion strategy which includes internal
development of new products collaboration with manufacturers of automated
instruments which may use the companys products investment in joint
ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys
business and acquisition of companies for new products or additional customer
base  each of the strategies carries risks that objectives will not be
achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected  during the early
development stage under the equity method of accounting a percentage of the
losses of certain companies in which the company may invest will be reported
as losses of the company as is the case with chemocentryx inc and
discovery genomics inc

government regulation

ongoing research and development activities including preclinical and
clinical testing and the production and marketing of the companys products
are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united
states and other countries  some of the companys products and manufacturing
processes and facilities require governmental approval prior to commercial
use  the approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the
type which may be developed by the company usually takes a number of years
and typically requires substantial expenditures  delays in obtaining
regulatory approvals would adversely affect the marketing of products
developed by the company and the companys ability to receive product
revenues or royalties  there can be no assurance that regulatory approvals
for such products will be obtained without lengthy delays if at all

attraction and retention of key employees

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing is critical
to the companys success  although the company believes it has been and will
be able to attract and retain such personnel there can be no assurance that
the company will be successful  in addition the companys anticipated
growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional
expertise such as clinical testing government approvals production and
marketing will require the addition of new management personnel and the
development of additional expertise by existing management personnel  the
failure to attract and retain such personnel or to develop such expertise
would adversely affect the companys business










                          item 2  properties

on july 1 1999 the company purchased for approximately 28 million the
facilities rd systems had been leasing in minneapolis minnesota  the rd

additional 20000 square feet in space connecting the three buildings  this
area houses a lunchroom a library and warehouse space in addition the
company constructed a 13000 square foot entrance to the facility

on march 15 2002 the company purchased property adjacent to its minneapolis
facility for approximately 89 million  the company has begun to renovate
this property and when complete in late fiscal 2003 the building will add
approximately 176000 square feet of space  the company plans to lease out
approximately 70 of the building as retail and office space and use the
remainder as warehouse and storage space  the company has begun construction
on an infill to connect this building to its current facility  the 78000
square foot infill expected to be completed in late fiscal 2002 will be
used primarily for laboratory space

the company has entered into an option agreement for additional real estate
adjacent to the current facility  this option is exerciable through january
2005

rd europe leases approximately 17000 square feet in a building in abingdon
england  base rent was 267000 in fiscal 2002

rd gmbh leases approximately 2300 square feet as a sales office in
wiesbadennordenstadt germany  base rent was 28000 in fiscal 2002

the company believes the acquired property purchase option and leased
property discussed above are adequate to meet its occupancy needs in the
foreseeable future




                       item 3  legal proceedings

on september 19 2000 the company brought a declaratory judgement action in
united states district court for the district of minnesota the court
seeking to have the court declare that no amount is owed by the company to
amgen inc amgen in connection with invoices in the amount of 319
million rendered by amgen in june 2000 for materials provided to the company
in past years  the company also claimed damages for breach of contract and
unfair business practices in violation of applicable statutes  amgen
subsequently acknowledged error and reduced the amount of its invoices by
39 million to 28 million  amgen filed a counterclaim seeking the 28
million plus interest and attorneys fees  on may 30 2002 the parties
agreed to a 175 million full complete and final cash settlement of the
dispute  the settlement was paid prior to june 30 2002

         item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial
                  condition and results of operations

company structure

techne corporation the company has two operating subsidiaries research and
diagnostic systems inc rd systems and rd systems europe ltd rd
europe rd systems located in minneapolis minnesota has two operating
segments its biotechnology division and its hematology division the
biotechnology division develops and manufactures purified cytokines
proteins antibodies and assay kits which are sold to biomedical
researchers and clinical research laboratories the hematology division
develops and manufactures whole blood hematology controls and calibrators
which are sold to hospitals and clinical laboratories to check the
performance of hematology instruments to assure the accuracy of hematology
test results rd europe the companys third operating segment located in
abingdon england is the european distributor of rd systems biotechnology
products rd europe has a german sales subsidiary rd systems gmbh the
company also had a foreign sales corporation techne export inc which was
dissolved in fiscal 2002

critical accounting policies

managements discussion and analysis of the companys financial condition and
results of operations are based upon the companys consolidated financial
statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these
financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses
and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on an ongoing
basis management evaluates its estimates management bases its estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

the company has identified the policies outlined below as critical to its
business operations and an understanding of results of operations the
listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all accounting
policies

valuation of accounts receivable

the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts
credit limits based upon payment history and the customers current
creditworthiness as determined by managements review of their current
credit information the company continuously monitors collections and
payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit
losses based upon the companys historical experience and any specific
customer collection issues that have been identified while such credit
losses have historically been within the companys general expectations and
the provisions established the company cannot guarantee that it will
continue to experience the same credit loss rates that have occurred in the
past

valuation of inventory

inventories are valued at the lower of cost firstin firstout method or
market the company regularly reviews inventories on hand and records a
provision for slowmoving and obsolete inventory inventory not meeting
quality control standards and inventory subject to expiration the provision
for slowmoving and obsolete inventory is based on current estimates of
future product demand market conditions and related management initiatives
any significant unanticipated changes in product demand or market conditions
could have an impact on the value of inventories

income taxes

the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to
audit in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which
may require an extended period of time to resolve in managements opinion
adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented

assessment of claims or pending litigation

the company is routinely subject to claims and involved in legal actions
which are incidental to the business of the company the ultimate outcomes of
these matters by their nature are difficult to predict accordingly
management may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilities
that could result from unfavorable outcomes of any asserted claims or pending
litigation as additional information becomes available the company will
assess the potential liabilities related to claims or pending litigation and

result of increased research spending

earnings before taxes increased from 39411797 in fiscal 2000 to
47808376 in fiscal 2001 the increase in earnings was primarily the result
of a 8543176 increase in rd systems biotechnology division earnings a
573280 increase in rd systems hematology division earnings and a 270873
increase in rd europe earnings the increases in earnings were due mainly to
increased sales and improved biotechnology division gross margins the
increased earnings by the above segments were partially offset by a
1142272 increase in operating losses by ccx as a result of increased
research spending

earnings before taxes increased from 26054010 in fiscal 1999 to
39411797 in fiscal 2000 the increase in earnings was primarily the result
of a 10803845 increase in rd systems biotechnology division earnings a
777379 increase in rd systems hematology division earnings and a 804885
increase in rd europe earnings the increases in earnings were due mainly to
increased sales and improved biotechnology division gross margins in
addition as a result of the research grant money received by ccx in fiscal
2000 ccxs losses decreased 2059224 from fiscal 1999 the above increases
in earnings were partially offset by increased interest expense related to

forwardlooking information

statements in this annual report and elsewhere that are forwardlooking
involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results
of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected
and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed
below

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change while the hematology controls industry historically has been subject
to less rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by hardware manufacturers
competitors of the company are numerous and include among others
specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument and equipment
manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical companies
universities and other research institutions there can be no assurance that
the companys competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and
products that are more effective than any which have been or are being
developed by the company or that would render the companys technologies and
products obsolete or noncompetitive

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is negotiating
licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products claimed to be
owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent infringement
study for each of its products it is possible that products of the company
may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the company may
have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or cease certain
activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby causing
additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material adverse
effect on the company

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of new
products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies
developing new products related to the companys business and the
acquisition of companies for new products and additional customer base carry
risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be
adversely affected

ongoing research and development activities including preclinical and
clinical testing and the production and marketing of the companys products
are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united
states and other countries the approval process applicable to clinical
diagnostic products of the type that may be developed by the company usually
takes a number of years and typically requires substantial expenditures
delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new
products developed by the company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical
to the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will
require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional
expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such
personnel could adversely affect the companys business

for additional information on risks and uncertainties see the companys
periodic reports filed with the securities and exchange commission




            item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures
                             about market risk

at the end of fiscal 2002 the company had a professionally managed
investment portfolio of fixed income securities excluding those classified
as cash and cash equivalents of 70671341 see note a of notes to
consolidated financial statements these securities like all fixed income
instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if
market interest rates increase however the company has the ability to hold
its fixed income investments until maturity and therefore the company would
not expect to recognize an adverse impact in income or cash flows

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially
adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes the company does not
enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce its exposure to
foreign currency rate changes on intercompany foreign currency denominated
balance sheet positions

as of june 30 2002 the companys longterm debt consisted of a mortgage
note payable with a fixed interest rate of 7 through july 2006 and is
thereafter adjusted based on us treasury rates thus during the period
that the interest rate is fixed interest rate fluctuations would not impact
interest expense or cash flows however the mortgage note payable will
increase or decrease in value if market interest rates change as of june 30
2002 the fair market value of the companys mortgage note payable
approximated its carrying value

receptor binding studies and related research reagents

the growing interest by researchers in cytokines exists because of the profound
effect a tiny amount of a cytokine can have on the cells and tissues of the
body  cytokines are intercellular messengers  they act as signals by
interacting with specific receptors on the effected cells  they carry vital
signals to the cells genetic machinery that can trigger events that can lead
to significant changes in a cell tissue or organism  for example cytokines
can signal a cell to differentiate ie to acquire the features necessary for
it to take on a more specialized task  another example of cytokine action is
the key role they play in stimulating cells surrounding a wound to grow and
divide and to attract migratory cells to the injury site

rd systems biotechnology division was formed in response to a growing need
for highly purified biologically active proteins  rd systems believes that
its cytokines are addressing the growing demand for these products within the
scientific research community

during fiscal 1990 the biotechnology division released its first cytokine
assay kits under the tradename quantikine  these kits are used by researchers
to quantify the level of a specific cytokine in a sample of blood serum or
other biological fluid  in fiscal 1996 the biotechnology division expanded
its quantikine line by introducing a line of assay kits for mouse cytokines
these kits are used extensively by research scientists doing cytokine studies
using animal models such as those used in pharmaceutical discovery and
development programs

current biotechnology products

cytokines and related antibodies  cytokines extracted from natural sources
or produced using recombinant dna technology are manufactured to the highest
purity  polyclonal antibodies are produced by injecting purified cytokines
into animals primarily goats and rabbits  the animals immune systems
recognize the cytokines as foreign and develop antibodies to these cytokines
the polyclonal antibodies are then extracted from the animals blood and
purified  monoclonal antibodies are produced by injecting purified cytokines
into mice  the b cells of a mouses immune system are then isolated and fused
with immortalized mouse cells that will produce the desired antibody  purified
cytokines and antibodies are made available both as research reagents and as
parts of assay kits below

assay kits  this product line includes rd systems human and murine
mouse and rat quantikine kits which allow research scientists to
quantify the amount of a specific cytokine in a sample of blood or tissue
also included in this product line are assay kits developed by rd
europe to quantify adhesion molecules  these kits are used by research
scientists to measure cellular adhesion molecules in serum plasma or
cell culture media  cellular adhesion molecules facilitate the movement
of infection fighting cells out of the blood stream to the site of
infections

clinical diagnostic kits  the epo kit acquired from amgen inc in fiscal
1992 was the first diagnostic assay for which rd systems had fda
marketing clearance  rd systems also has received fda marketing
clearance for its transferrin receptor tfr and beta2microglobulin kits

flow cytometry products  this product line includes rd systems fluorokine
kits which are used to measure the presence or absence of receptors for
specific cytokines on the surface of cells

dna and related products  designer genes and designer probes are synthetic
dnas used in the study of gene function


                         hematology controls and calibrators

hematology controls and calibrators manufactured and marketed through the
hematology division of rd systems are products made up of the various
cellular components of blood  proper diagnosis of many illnesses requires a
thorough and accurate analysis of the patients blood cells which is usually
done with automatic or semiautomatic hematology instruments  controls and
calibrators ensure that these instruments are performing accurately and
reliably

blood is composed of plasma the fluid portion of which is mainly water and
blood cells which are suspended in the plasma  there are three basic types
of blood cells  red cells white cells and platelets   red cells transport
oxygen from the lungs throughout the body which they do by being rich in
hemoglobin  white cells defend the body against foreign invaders  platelets
serve as a plug to stem blood flow at the site of an injury by initiating a
complex series of biochemical reactions that lead to the formation of a clot

the formed elements of blood red cells white cells and platelets differ a
great deal in size and concentration  the white cells are the largest in
size and platelets the smallest  the red cells are the most numerous and
constitute 95 percent of all blood cells  the average adult has from 20 to
30 trillion red cells  for every 500 red cells there are approximately one
white cell and about 20 platelets  as noted above hematology controls are
used in automatic and semiautomatic cell counting analyzers to make sure
these instruments are counting blood cells accurately  one of the most
frequently performed laboratory tests on a blood sample is called a complete
blood count or cbc for short  doctors use this test in disease screening
and diagnosis  more than a billion of these tests are done every year the
great majority with cell counting instruments  in most laboratories the cbc
consists of the white cell count the red cell count the hemoglobin reading
and the hematocrit reading or the percent of red cells in a volume of whole
blood after it has been centrifuged  also included in a cbc test is the
differential which numbers and classifies the different types of white cells

these and other characteristics or parameters of a blood sample can be
measured by automatic or semiautomatic cell counters  cell counters can read
the parameters of blood either by impedance in which a cell interrupts an
electrical current and is counted or by a laser in which a cell interrupts
a laser beam and is counted  the number of parameters measurable in a blood
control product depends on the type and sophistication of the instrument for
which the control is designed  ordinarily a hematology control is used once
to several times a day to make sure the instrument is reading accurately
some instruments need to be calibrated periodically  hematology calibrators
are similar to controls but go through additional processing and testing to
ensure that the calibration values assigned are extremely accurate and can be
used to adjust the instrument

the hematology division of rd systems offers a complete line of hematology
controls and calibrators for both impedance and laser type cell counters
rd systems believes its products have improved stability and versatility and
a longer shelf life than most of those of its competitors  the hematology
division supplies hematology control products for use as proficiency testing
materials by laboratory certifying authorities of a number of states and
countries  all products are priced competitively and come with an
unconditional money back guarantee  rd systems recognizes that developing
technologies for cell counting instruments will require increasingly
sophisticated and highquality controls and is prepared to meet this
challenge

products under development

rd systems is engaged in ongoing research and development in all of its
major product lines  hematology controls and calibrators biotechnology
cytokines antibodies assays and related products  the company believes
that its future success depends to a large extent on the ability to keep
pace with changing technologies and markets  at the same time the company
continues to examine its production processes to ensure high quality and
maximum economy

rd systems biotechnology division is planning to release new cytokines
antibodies and cytokine assay kits in the coming year  all of these products
will be for research purposes only and therefore do not require fda
clearance  rd systems hematology division has developed several new
control products in fiscal 2001 and is continuously working on product
improvements and enhancements  however there is no assurance that any of
the products in the research and development phase can be developed or if
developed can be successfully introduced into the marketplace

expenditures for research and development activities were 14522233
11198309 and 12004798 for fiscal years 2001 2000 and 1999
respectively


business relationships

during fiscal 1998 1999 and 2000 the company purchased a total of 5
million of convertible preferred stock of chemocentryx inc ccx which
gave the company a 49 interest in ccx through january 2001  in february
2001 ccx obtained 23 million in financing through the issuance of 8846154
shares of  additional preferred stock  the company currently holds
approximately 26 of the outstanding voting stock of ccx  ccx is a
technology and drug development company working in the area of chemokines
chemokines are cytokines which regulate the trafficking patterns of
leukocytes the effector cells of the human immune system  in conjunction
with the equity investment and joint research efforts the company obtained
exclusive worldwide research and diagnostic marketing rights to chemokine
proteins antibodies and receptors discovered or developed by ccx or rd
systems  the company accounts for the investment under the equity method of
accounting and through january 2001 recognized 100 of the losses of ccx
due to the limited amount of cash consideration provided by the holders of
the common shares of ccx  subsequent to january 2001 the company is
including ccx operating results in its consolidated financial statements
based on its ownership percentage  the companys net investment in ccx was
6441481 and 3553516 at june 30 2001 and 2000 respectively

on august 2 2001 the company made an equity investment of 3 million and
entered into a research and license agreement with discovery genomics inc
dgi of minneapolis minnesota  dgi was recently organized and holds
licenses from the university of minnesota to develop technologies used for
functional genomics and the discovery of druggable targets  the company
acquired a 39 equity interest in dgi and warrants to acquire additional
equity  the company also received the rights to develop antibodies and
immunoassay kits for proteins discovered by dgi and an exclusive royalty
free license to sell such products in the research market  the companys
investment will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting

original equipment manufacturers oem agreements represent the largest
market for hematology controls and calibrators made by rd systems  in
fiscal year 2001 oem contracts accounted for 7096901 or 48 of hematology
division revenues and 6 of total consolidated revenues


government regulation

all manufacturers of hematology controls and calibrators are regulated under
the federal food drug and cosmetic act as amended  all of rd systems
hematology control products are classified as in vitro diagnostic products
by the fda  the entire hematology control manufacturing process from
receipt of raw materials to the monitoring of control products through their
expiration date is strictly regulated and documented  fda inspectors make
periodic site inspections of the hematology divisions control operations and
facilities  hematology control manufacturing must comply with good
manufacturing practices gmp as set forth in the fdas regulations governing
medical devices

three of rd systems immunoassay kits epo tfr and beta2microglobulin
have fda clearance to be sold for clinical diagnostic use  rd systems must
comply with gmp for the manufacture of these kits  biotechnology products
manufactured in the united states and sold for use in the research market do
not require fda clearance

some of rd systems research groups use small amounts of radioactive
materials in the form of radioisotopes in their product development
activities  thus rd systems is subject to regulation by the us nuclear
regulatory commission nrc and has been granted an nrc license due to expire
in april 2002  the license is renewable annually  rd systems is also
subject to regulation and inspection by the department of health of the state
of minnesota for its use of radioactive materials  it has been granted a
certificate of registration which is renewable annually by the minnesota
department of health  the current certificate expires april 1 2002  rd
systems has had no difficulties in renewing these licenses in prior years and
has no reason to believe they will not be renewed in the future  if
however the licenses were not renewed it would have minimal effect on rd
systems business since there are other technologies the research groups
could use to replace radioisotopes


availability of raw materials

the primary raw material for the companys hematology controls is whole
blood  human blood is purchased from commercial blood banks and porcine and
bovine blood is purchased from nearby meat processing plants  after raw
blood is received it is separated into its components processed and
stabilized  although the cost of human blood has increased owing largely to
the requirement that it be tested for hiv aids antibodies and hepatitis
the higher cost of these materials has not had a serious adverse effect on
the companys business  rd systems does not perform its own testing for the
aids antibodies as the supplier tests all human blood purchased  rd
systems biotechnology division develops and manufactures the majority of its
cytokines from synthetic genes developed inhouse thus significantly
reducing its reliance on outside resources  rd systems typically has
several outside sources for all critical raw materials necessary for the
manufacture of products


patents and trademarks

rd systems owns patent protection for certain hematology controls  rd
systems may seek patent protection for new or existing products it
manufactures  no assurance can be given that any such patent protection will
be obtained  no assurance can be given that rd systems products do not
infringe upon patents or proprietary rights owned or claimed by others
particularly for genetically engineered products rd systems has not
conducted a patent infringement study for each of its products

rd systems and rd europe have a number of licensing agreements with patent
holders under which they have the nonexclusive right to patented technology
or the nonexclusive right to manufacture and sell certain patented cytokine
and cytokine related products to the research market  for fiscal 2001 total
royalties expensed under these licenses were approximately 1563000

rd systems has obtained federal trademark registration for certain of its
hematology controls and biotechnology product groups  rd systems believes
it has common law trademark rights to certain marks in addition to those
which it has registered


seasonality of business

sales of the products manufactured by rd systems and rd europe are not
seasonal although rd europe historically experiences a slowing of sales
during the summer months


significant customers

no single customer accounted for more than 10 of total revenues during
fiscal 2001 2000 or 1999


backlog

there was no significant backlog of orders for the companys products as of
the date of this report or as of a comparable date for fiscal 2000


competition

the worldwide market for cytokines and research diagnostic assay kits is
being supplied by a number of biotechnology companies including bd
biosciences biosource international sigma chemical co amersham pharmacia
and cn biosciences  rd systems believes that it is the leading worldwide
supplier of cytokine related products in the research marketplace  rd
systems believes that the expanding line of its products their recognized
quality and the growing demand for these rare and versatile proteins
antibodies and assay kits will allow the company to remain competitive in
the growing biotechnology research and diagnostic market

competition is intense in the hematology control business  the first control
products were developed in response to the rapid advances in electronic
instrumentation used in hospital and clinical laboratories for blood cell
counting  historically most of the instrument manufacturing companies made
controls for use in their own instruments  with rapid expansion of the
instrument market however a need for more versatile controls enabled non
instrument manufacturers to gain a foothold  today the market is comprised
of manufacturers of laboratory reagents chemicals and coagulation products
and independent control manufacturers in addition to instrument
manufacturers  the principal hematology control competitors of rd systems
retail products are beckman coulter inc toa sysmex streck laboratories
abbott diagnostics and hematronix inc  rd systems believes it is the third
largest supplier of hematology controls in the marketplace behind beckman
coulter and streck laboratories

employees

rd systems had 447 fulltime and 47 parttime employees as of june 30 2001
rd europe had 47 fulltime and 10 parttime employees as of june 30 2001
including 9 fulltime and 1 parttime at rd europes sales subsidiary in
germany


environment

compliance with federal state and local environmental protection laws in the
united states england and germany had no material effect on rd systems or
rd europe in fiscal 2001

cautionary statements

the company wishes to caution investors that the following important factors
among others in some cases have affected and in the future could affect the
companys actual results of operations and cause such results to differ
materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements made in this
document and elsewhere by or on behalf of the company

risk of technological obsolescence and competition

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change  while the hematology controls industry historically has been subject
to less rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by hardware manufacturers
competitors of the company in the united states and abroad are numerous and
include among others specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory
instrument and equipment manufacturers and disposables suppliers major
pharmaceutical companies universities and other research institutions
there can be no assurance that the companys competitors will not succeed in
developing technologies and products that are more effective than any which
have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the
companys technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive  many of
these competitors have substantially greater resources and product
development production and marketing capabilities than the company  with
regard to diagnostic kits which constitute a relatively minor portion of the
companys business many of the companys competitors have significantly
greater experience than the company in undertaking preclinical testing and
clinical trials of new or improved diagnostic kits and obtaining fda and
other regulatory approvals of such products

patents and proprietary rights

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain licenses
and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing
the proprietary rights of others  the company has filed a very limited
number of united states and foreign patent applications for products in which
it believes it has a proprietary interest  the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others  the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products  it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company  the patenting of hematology and biotechnology
processes and products involves complex legal and factual questions and to
date there has emerged no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims
in biotechnology patents  protracted and costly litigation may be necessary
to enforce rights of the company and defend against claims of infringement of
rights of others

financial impact of expansion strategy

the company engages in an expansion strategy which includes internal
development of new products collaboration with manufacturers of automated
instruments which may use the companys products investment in joint
ventures and companies developing new products related to the companys
business and acquisition of companies for new products or additional customer
base  each of the strategies carries risks that objectives will not be
achieved and future earnings will be adversely affected  during the early
development stage a percentage of the operating losses of certain companies
in which the company may invest will be reported as losses of the company as
is the case with chemocentryx inc and discovery genomics inc

government regulation

ongoing research and development activities including preclinical and
clinical testing and the production and marketing of the companys products
are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united
states and other countries  some of the companys products and manufacturing
processes and facilities require governmental approval prior to commercial
use  the approval process applicable to clinical diagnostic products of the
type which may be developed by the company usually takes a number of years
and typically requires substantial expenditures  delays in obtaining
regulatory approvals would adversely affect the marketing of products
developed by the company and the companys ability to receive product
revenues or royalties  there can be no assurance that regulatory approvals
for such products will be obtained without lengthy delays if at all

attraction and retention of key employees

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing is critical
to the companys success  although the company believes it has been and will
be able to attract and retain such personnel there can be no assurance that
the company will be successful  in addition the companys anticipated
growth and expansion into areas and activities requiring additional
expertise such as clinical testing government approvals production and
marketing will require the addition of new management personnel and the
development of additional expertise by existing management personnel  the
failure to attract and retain such personnel or to develop such expertise
would adversely affect the companys business

litigation

on september 19 2000 the company brought a declaratory judgement action in
united states district court for the district of minnesota the court
seeking to have the court declare that no amount is owed by the company to
amgen inc amgen in connection with invoices in the amount of 319
million rendered by amgen in june 2000 for materials provided to the company
in past years  the company also claimed damages for breach of contract and
unfair business practices in violation of applicable statutes  amgen
subsequently acknowledged error and reduced the amount of its invoices by
39 million to 28 million  amgen filed a counterclaim seeking the 28
million plus interest and attorneys fees  the company believes that it has
strong defenses to amgens claims and that it owes no material amount  the
ultimate outcome of litigation however cannot be predicted with certainty
an unfavorable outcome to the litigation with amgen would not adversely
impair the operations of the company or its financial condition but would
have a material effect on net income for the period in which realized  see
financial statements note e commitments and contingencies










                            item 2  properties

on july 1 1999 the company purchased for approximately 28 million the
facilities rd systems had been leasing in minneapolis minnesota  the rd

square feet administrative sales and marketing functions are also located
at the 2201 kennnedy street building the company also occupies an additional
20000 square feet in space connecting the three buildings  this area houses
a lunchroom a library and additional warehouse space in addition the
company constructed a 13000 square foot entrance to the facility  the
company has entered into two option agreements for real estate adjacent to
the current facility  the options are exercisable through november 2001 and
january 2005 on the two properties respectively  the company plans to
exercise its option on the first property during fiscal 2002 and plans to
build an infill to connect this property with its current facility

rd europe subleased approximately 12500 square feet in one building in
abingdon england  the lease on the building expired in june 2001 in may
2001 rd europe began leasing approximately 17000 square feet in a building
less than one mile from its previous location  rental rates for the new
facility are expected to be slightly higher than rates under the previous
sublease  base rent was 195000 in fiscal 2001

rd gmbh leases approximately 2300 square feet as a sales office in
wiesbadennordenstadt germany  base rent was 32000 in fiscal 2001

the company believes the acquired property purchase options and leased
property discussed above are adequate to meet its occupancy needs in the
foreseeable future

from fiscal 2000 net sales by rd systems biotechnology division for the
period increased 9426085 15 net sales by rd systems hematology
division increased 1135001 8 and net sales by rd europe increased
957321 4 the increase in consolidated net sales for the fiscal year was
due largely to increased sales of proteins and antibodies rd europes net
sales for fiscal 2001 were affected by changes in foreign currency exchange
rates in british pounds rd europes net sales increased 14 from the prior
year and adjusted for all changes in exchange rates rd europes net sales
for fiscal 2001 would have been approximately 29 million higher than
reported

14 from fiscal 1999 net sales by rd systems biotechnology division for
the period increased 9269504 17 net sales by rd systems hematology
division increased 901919 7 and net sales by rd europe increased
2766035 12 the increase in consolidated net sales for the fiscal year

period increased 17247069 46 net sales by rd systems hematology
division increased 889451 8 and net sales by rd europe increased
5472739 31 the increase in consolidated net sales for the fiscal year
was due in part to the acquisition of genzyme corporations research
products business on july 1 1998 in addition the increase in consolidated
net sales was due to increased sales of rd systems products to both rd
systems customers and to former genzyme customers as they were converted from
genzyme products to rd systems products

gross margins as a percentage of sales increased from 742 in fiscal 2000
to 754 in fiscal 2001 biotechnology division gross margins increased from
769 in fiscal 2000 to 786 in fiscal 2001 margins in the first half of
fiscal 2000 were affected by higher cost inventory acquired from genzyme rd
europe gross margins decreased from 419 in fiscal 2000 to 383 in fiscal
2001 mainly as a result of changes in exchange rates hematology division
gross margins decreased from 484 in fiscal 2000 to 467 in fiscal 2001 as

fiscal 1998 to 699 in fiscal 1999 biotechnology division gross margins
decreased from 729 in fiscal 1998 to 708 in fiscal 1999 as a result of
lower gross profit levels on inventory acquired from genzyme and the write
off of obsolete genzyme packaging and kit components due to conversion of
customers to rd systems labeled product rd europe and hematology division
gross margins did not change significantly from the prior year

selling general and administrative expenses increased 399084 2 in
fiscal 2001 the increase was the result of increased wages and benefits
partially offset by exchange rate changes

selling general and administrative expenses increased 452914 3 in
fiscal 2000 the increase was the result of increased wages and benefits and
exchange rate losses partially offset by decreased rent expense due to the
purchase of rd systems minneapolis facilities on july 1 1999

selling general and administrative expenses increased 1494457 10 in
fiscal 1999 the majority of the increase in consolidated selling general
and administrative expenses was due to additional sales personnel added in
the us and europe as a result of the genzyme acquisition and associated
advertising and promotion activities

research and development expenses increased 3323924 in fiscal 2001
decreased 806489 in fiscal 2000 and increased 1366994 in fiscal 1999
the decrease in consolidated research and development expenses in fiscal 2000
was a result of research grant money received in fiscal 2000 by chemocentryx
inc ccx which offset ccxs research expenses ccx is a technology and
drug development company in which the company has invested research and
development expenses by rd systems increased 24 16 and 6 million in
fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 respectively these increases were primarily the
result of the development and release of new cytokines antibodies and assay
kits by rd systems biotechnology division and the development and release
of several new hematology division control products management of the
company believes that rd systems will continue to develop new products

earnings before taxes increased from 39411797 in fiscal 2000 to
47808376 in fiscal 2001 the increase in earnings was primarily the result
of a 8543176 increase in rd systems biotechnology division earnings a
573280 increase in rd systems hematology division earnings and a 270873
increase in rd europe earnings the increases were due mainly to increased
sales and improved biotechnology division gross margins the increases in
consolidated earnings were partially offset by a 1142272 increase in
operating losses by ccx as a result of increased research spending

earnings before taxes increased from 26054010 in fiscal 1999 to
39411797 in fiscal 2000 the increase in earnings was primarily the result
of a 10803845 increase in rd systems biotechnology division earnings a
777379 increase in rd systems hematology division earnings and a 804885
increase in rd europe earnings the increases were due mainly to increased
sales and improved biotechnology division gross margins in addition as a
result of the research grant money received by ccx in fiscal 2000 ccxs
losses decreased 2059224 from fiscal 1999 the above were partially offset
by increased interest expense related to financing of the building
acquisition

earnings before taxes increased from 22410961 in fiscal 1998 to
26054010 in fiscal 1999 despite 954 million in intangible asset
amortization in fiscal 1999 related to the genzyme acquisition the increase
in earnings was primarily the result of a 3073439 increase in rd systems
biotechnology division earnings a 583237 increase in rd systems
hematology division earnings and a 942983 increase in rd europe earnings
all as a result of increased sales these increases were offset by increased
net losses by ccx of 744209

income taxes for fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 were provided at rates of
approximately 29 33 and 36 respectively the decrease in the tax rate in
fiscal 2001 is due primarily to increased tax exempt interest income and a
onetime 12 million credit as a result of the closeout of pending issues
related to a state income tax examination for fiscal years 1996 through 1999
in fiscal 2000 ccx losses were offset by grant money received resulting in
a decrease in the tax rate from fiscal 1999 the higher tax rate in fiscal
1999 was due to the net losses of ccx for which no tax benefit was provided
us federal and state taxes have been reduced as a result of taxexempt
interest income the benefit of the foreign sales corporation and the
federal and state credit for research and development expenditures foreign
income taxes have been provided at rates which approximate the tax rates in
the united kingdom and germany

new accounting pronouncements

in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission issued staff
accounting bulletin sab no 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements which provides guidance in applying generally accepted
accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements the
application of this sab did not have a material impact on the companys
operating results or financial position

on july 1 2000 the company adopted statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities as amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative
instruments and certain hedging activities sfas no 133 establishes
accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and for hedging
activities it requires that all derivatives including those embedded in
other contracts be recognized as either assets or liabilities and that those
financial instruments be measured at fair value the accounting for changes
in the fair value of derivatives depends on their intended use and
designation  management has reviewed the requirements of sfas no 133 and
has determined that they have no freestanding or embedded derivatives all
contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also
meet the requirements of and have been designated as normal purchases or
sales the companys policy is to not use freestanding derivatives and to
not enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal
purchases or sales

in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
141 business combinations and sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible
assets sfas no 141 applies to all business combinations initiated after
june 30 2001 and prohibits the use of the poolingofinterests method of
accounting there are also transition provisions provided that apply to
business combinations completed before july 1 2001 that were accounted for
using the purchase method under sfas no 142 goodwill as well as other
intangibles determined to have an infinite life will no longer be amortized
however these assets will be reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis
sfas no 142 also includes provisions for the reclassification of certain
existing recognized intangibles as goodwill reclassification of certain
intangibles out of previously reported goodwill and the identification of
reporting units for purposes of assessing potential future impairments of
goodwill the company plans to adopt sfas no 142 on july 1 2002 the
company is currently assessing but has not yet determined the impact of
these statements on its financial position and results of operations as of
june 30 2001 the company had net goodwill and other intangibles assets of
approximately 188 million and 86 million respectively amortization
expense recorded during fiscal 2001 2000 and 1999 was approximately 89
million 92 million and 96 million respectively


forwardlooking information

statements in this annual report and elsewhere that are forwardlooking
involve risks and uncertainties which may affect the companys actual results
of operations certain of these risks and uncertainties which have affected
and in the future could affect the companys actual results are discussed
below

the biotechnology industry is subject to rapid and significant technological
change while the hematology controls industry historically has been subject
to less rapid change it too is evolving and is impacted significantly by
changes in the automated testing equipment offered by hardware manufacturers
competitors of the company are numerous and include among others
specialized biotechnology firms medical laboratory instrument and equipment
manufacturers and disposables suppliers major pharmaceutical companies
universities and other research institutions there can be no assurance that
the companys competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and
products that are more effective than any which have been or are being
developed by the company or that would render the companys technologies and
products obsolete or noncompetitive

the companys success will depend in part on its ability to obtain
licenses and patents maintain trade secret protection and operate without
infringing the proprietary rights of others the company has obtained and is
negotiating licenses to produce a number of cytokines and related products
claimed to be owned by others since the company has not conducted a patent
infringement study for each of its products it is possible that products of
the company may unintentionally infringe patents of third parties or that the
company may have to alter its products or processes pay licensing fees or
cease certain activities because of patent rights of third parties thereby
causing additional unexpected costs and delays which may have a material
adverse effect on the company

the companys expansion strategies which include internal development of
new products collaborations investments in joint ventures and companies
developing new products related to the companys business and the
acquisition of companies for new products and additional customer base carry
risks that objectives will not be achieved and future earnings will be
adversely affected

ongoing research and development activities including preclinical and
clinical testing and the production and marketing of the companys products
are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the united
states and other countries the approval process applicable to clinical
diagnostic products of the type that may be developed by the company usually
takes a number of years and typically requires substantial expenditures
delays in obtaining approvals could adversely affect the marketing of new
products developed by the company

recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and production personnel to
perform research and development work and product manufacturing are critical
to the companys success the companys anticipated growth and its expected
expansion into areas and activities requiring additional expertise will
require the addition of new personnel and the development of additional
expertise by existing personnel the failure to attract and retain such
personnel could adversely affect the companys business

on september 19 2000 the company brought a declaratory judgement action
in united states district court for the district of minnesota the court
seeking to have the court declare that no amount is owed by the company to
amgen inc amgen in connection with invoices in the amount of 319
million rendered by amgen in june 2000 for materials provided to the company
in past years the company also claimed damages for breach of contract and
unfair business practices in violation of applicable statutes amgen
subsequently acknowledged error and reduced the amount of its invoices by
39 million to 28 million  amgen filed a counterclaim seeking the 28
million plus interest and attorneys fees the company believes that it has
strong defenses to amgens claims and that it owes no material amount the
ultimate outcome of litigation however cannot be predicted with certainty
an unfavorable outcome to the litigation with amgen would not adversely
impair the operations of the company or its financial condition but would
have a material effect on net income for the period in which realized see

               item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures
                                about market risk

at the end of fiscal 2001 the company had an investment portfolio of fixed
income securities excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents
of 75804077 see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements
these securities like all fixed income instruments are subject to interest
rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase
however the company has the ability to hold its fixed income investments
until maturity and therefore the company would not expect to recognize an
adverse impact in income or cash flows

the company operates internationally and thus is subject to potentially
adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes the company does not
enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce its exposure to
foreign currency rate changes on intercompany foreign currency denominated
balance sheet positions
