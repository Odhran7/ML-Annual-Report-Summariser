the company’s australian operating businesses are subject to other parts of the broadcasting services act that may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities 

benchmark regulation 

certain benchmarks provided by the company’s opis business are subject to regulation in the uk and may become subject to similar evolving regulations in other jurisdictions if for example such benchmarks are used by supervised entities such as trading venues in the applicable jurisdiction these regulations generally require among other things that benchmarks be provided by an authorized benchmark administrator while the company currently uses a thirdparty administrator the company intends to establish its own benchmark administrator which will need to comply with a wideranging set of requirements regulating among other things conflicts of interest complaints handling input data benchmark methodologies and other matters a benchmark administrator must also publish a benchmark statement as well as a procedure concerning the actions to be taken in the event of changes to or the cessation of a benchmark which may be used in the applicable market the opis business has also aligned its oil and commodities price reporting with the international organisation of securities commission’s “iosco’s” principles for oil reporting agencies which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil and commodity price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by iosco members 

data privacy and security regulation 

the company’s business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us certain of the company’s websites mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits the collection of personal information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent in addition the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements more state and local governments are also expanding enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and in some cases afford private rights of action to individuals for failure to comply and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” and california privacy rights act “cpra” which will amend the ccpa in january 2023 establish certain transparency rules put greater restrictions on how the company can collect use and share personal information of california residents and provide california residents with certain rights regarding their personal information the ccpa and forthcoming cpra provide for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches similar legislation in virginia colorado utah and connecticut all of which will go into effect in 2023 impose transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of their respective residents and provide residents with similar rights with the exception of a private right of action 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union the uk and australia for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which provides a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and the uk adopted the data protection act of 2018 the “uk dpa” as well as the uk general data protection regulation “uk gdpr”  the gdpr uk dpa and uk gdpr expand the regulation of the collection processing use sharing and security of personal data contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthen the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continue to restrict the transborder flow of such data require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals require mandatory data breach reporting and notification significantly increase maximum penalties for noncompliance up to 20 million euros or 17 million pounds as applicable or 4 of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year whichever is higher and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities the 

european union also plans to replace its existing eprivacy directive with a new eprivacy regulation that will complement the gdpr and amend certain rules including with respect to cookies and other similar technologies that the company utilizes to obtain information from visitors to the company’s various digital offerings the uk data protection framework is also expected to be reformed through the introduction of a data reform bill 

the company and some of its service providers rely on certain mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses to address the european and uk data protection requirements for transfers of data that continue to evolve and are often subject to uncertainty and legal challenges in june 2021 the european commission adopted two new sets of european union standard contractual clauses which regulate the relationship between controller and processor in accordance with the gdpr and international data transfers to a third country in the absence of an adequacy decision under the gdpr the european data protection board also adopted recommendations on measures that supplement data transfer tools to ensure compliance with the level of personal data protection required in europe including requirements for data exporters to assess the risks related to the transfer of personal data outside the european economic area and to implement if necessary additional contractual organizational and technical measures such as encryption and pseudonymization for data transfers subject to the uk gdpr the international data transfer agreement and the international data transfer addendum to the european union standard contractual clauses have also been adopted such evolving frameworks could cause the company to incur additional costs require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services 

in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain and evolving in the united states and internationally moreover data privacy and security laws vary between local state federal and international jurisdictions and may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press a press recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established once approved by the press recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers in addition to the press recognition panel certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is commenced the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances 

press regulator impress was recognized as an approved regulator by the press recognition panel on october 25 2016 however publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso in september 2014 ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code of practice and levy fines of up to £1 million the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members including the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance 

uk radio and television broadcasting regulation 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland and its recently launched talktv are subject to regulation by the office of communications ofcom the regulatory body for broadcasting in the uk in accordance with ofcom’s regulations the 

company is required among other things to obtain and maintain licenses to operate these radio stations and talktv although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of ofcom could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by among other means preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions the company also seeks to limit such threat to its intellectual property by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws however effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock 

risks relating to the company’s businesses and operations 

the company operates in a highly competitive business environment and its success depends on its ability to compete effectively including by responding to evolving technologies and changes in consumer and customer behavior 

the company faces significant competition from other providers of news information entertainment and real estaterelated products and services see “business overview” for more information regarding competition within each of the company’s segments this competition continues to intensify as a result of changes in technologies platforms and business models and corresponding changes in consumer and customer behavior for example enhanced internet capabilities developments in content distribution platforms and the emergence of new media channels have increased the choices available to consumers for content consumption and adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact demand for the company’s newspapers television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay consumption of the company’s content on thirdparty delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and monetization control loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates while the company has multiyear agreements with several large platforms pursuant to which the company licenses its content for use on such platforms in exchange for significant payments there is no guarantee that these content license agreements will be renewed on terms favorable to the company or at all these trends and developments have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect both the company’s circulation and subscription revenue and in turn advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from the company as well as increase subscriber acquisition retention and other costs 

technological developments have also increased competition in other ways for example digital video content is becoming more prevalent and attractive for many consumers via directtoconsumer offerings as internet streaming capabilities have enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated content platforms and selfpublishing tools combined in some cases with widespread availability of sophisticated search engines and public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information and solutions have also reduced the effort and expense of locating gathering and disseminating data and producing and distributing certain types of content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company often at a lower cost and potentially diminishing the perceived value of the company’s offerings additional digital distribution channels such as online retailers and digital marketplaces have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s business models including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

in order to compete effectively the company must differentiate its brands and their associated products and services respond to new technologies distribution channels and platforms develop new products and services and consistently anticipate and respond to changes in consumer and customer needs and preferences which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on brand awareness reputation and acceptance of its highquality differentiated content and other products and services the breadth depth and accuracy of information provided by its digital real estate services and professional information businesses as well as its wide array of digital offerings in order to retain and grow its audiences consumers and subscribers however consumer preferences change frequently and are difficult to predict and when faced with a 

multitude of choices consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source quality or reliability online traffic and product and service purchases are also driven by internet search results referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that are changed frequently and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users the company has limited control over these changes and any failure to successfully manage and adapt to them could impede the company’s ability to compete effectively by significantly decreasing traffic to its digital offerings lowering advertiser interest in those offerings increasing costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lowering product sales and subscriptions 

the company expects to continue to pursue new strategic initiatives and develop new and enhanced products and services in order to remain competitive such as additional streaming features and new content aggregation offerings innovative digital news products and experiences its recently launched talktv in the uk and the continued expansion into various adjacencies at its digital real estate services businesses the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in order to implement these strategies and develop these new and improved products and services including costs relating to the initiatives referenced above as well as other costs to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies and attract and retain employees with the necessary knowledge and skills there can be no assurance any strategic initiatives products and services will be successful in the manner or time period or at the cost the company expects or that it will realize the anticipated benefits it expects the failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors have greater resources fewer regulatory burdens better competitive positions in certain areas greater operating capabilities greater access to sources of content data technology or other services or strategic relationships andor easier access to financing which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology consumer and customer needs and preferences and market conditions continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the company operates may increase these advantages including through greater scale financial leverage andor access to content data technology and other offerings if the company is unable to compete successfully its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures could cause the company’s revenues and operating results to decline significantly 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising and its ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors including 1 demand for the company’s products and services 2 audience fragmentation 3 digital advertising trends 4 its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers 5 general economic and business conditions 6 demographics of the customer base 7 advertising rates 8 advertising effectiveness and 9 maintaining its brand strength and reputation 

demand for the company’s products and services is evaluated based on a variety of metrics which are used by advertisers to determine the amount of advertising to purchase from the company and advertising rates for the company’s digital offerings advertisers evaluate demand based on metrics such as the number of visits number of users and user engagement other metrics include circulation levels for the company’s newspapers ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand particularly demand generated through new platforms may lead to undermeasurement and in turn lower advertising pricing and spending 

the popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news entertainment information and other content and the ability of digital advertising to deliver targeted measurable impressions promptly has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms and materially and adversely impacted the company’s print advertising revenues large digital platforms in particular such as facebook google and amazon which have extensive audience reach data and targeting capabilities continue to command an increasing share of the digital advertising market new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media platforms such as online and mobile social networking have also increased the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising particularly mobile advertising than for print advertising consequently despite continued growth in the company’s digital advertising revenues such revenues may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure and the loss of a direct relationship with marketers  thirdparty delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and monetization control loss of a direct relationship with consumers and adversely affect the company’s ability to understand its audience andor collect and apply data for targeted advertising the company’s digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies such as google’s ad manager which if interrupted or meaningfully changed or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure could adversely impact advertising revenues andor operating costs in addition evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising as well as the development and implementation of technology regulations policies and practices that adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of its advertising including blocking the display of advertising browsing incognito blocking or deleting cookies and ip addresses the phaseout of support for third party cookies and mobile identifiers as well as optin requirements and new privacy regulations may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage and grow digital audiences collect and leverage better user data develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content and video and mobile advertising and demonstrate the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings 

the company’s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions which tend to be cyclical as well as election and other news cycles natural disasters including extreme weather pandemics including the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic and other widespread health crises inflation including higher labor costs supply chain disruptions war or acts of terrorism have led and could continue to lead to greater economic uncertainty and reduced spending by advertisers the company experienced a shortterm decline in advertising during the third quarter of fiscal 2022 due to the war in ukraine while that decline was immaterial continued economic disruption from the war has broadened inflationary pressures and may lead to decreased spending by advertisers in addition certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company’s advertising revenues including retail technology and finance some of these sectors such as retail are more sensitive to weakness in economic conditions as well as increased online competition a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer reduced demand for the company’s offerings a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the inability to obtain and retain sports entertainment and other programming rights and content could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company’s operating businesses and costs could also increase upon renewal 

competition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense and the success of certain of the company’s operating businesses including its subscription television business depends on among other things their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof such as music rights that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices the company’s subscription television business has experienced higher programming costs due to among other things 1 increases imposed by sports entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts 2 incremental investment requirements for new services 3 increased ability for other digital media companies including streaming services to obtain rights to popular or exclusive content and 4 reduced content supply in the previous two years due to the covid19 pandemic certain of the company’s operating businesses including its subscription television business are party to contracts for a substantial amount of sports entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties including professional sports leagues and teams television and motion picture producers and other content providers these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms and as they expire renewals on favorable terms may be difficult to obtain in the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire the financial and other terms such as exclusivity rights under these contracts may change unfavorably as a result of various reasons beyond the company’s control such as changes in the company’s ability to secure these rights in order to retain or extend such rights the company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs and third parties may outbid the company for those rights andor for any new programming offerings in addition as other content providers develop their own competing

macroeconomic and market risks 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies and markets have weakened recently and are experiencing uncertainty and volatility due to among other things higher inflation changes in monetary policy increased interest rates supply chain disruptions volatile foreign currency exchange rates the war in ukraine the ongoing recovery from the covid19 pandemic and trade disputes and other geopolitical events these conditions increased the company’s costs in fiscal 2022 and higher home prices and interest rates in particular contributed to recent declines in real estate lead and transaction volumes and adjacent businesses at its digital real estate services business these and other similar conditions have in the past also resulted in and could in the future lead to among other things a tightening of and in some cases more limited access to the credit and capital markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a decline in the real estate and energy and commodities markets such weakness and uncertainty and associated market disruptions have often led to broader prolonged economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures lower demand for the company’s products and services unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased pricing pressures higher borrowing costs and decreased ability of third parties to satisfy their obligations to the company and have adversely affected the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity any continued or recurring economic weakness is likely to have a similar impact on the company’s business and reduce its circulation and subscription advertising real estate consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses the company is particularly exposed to 1 certain australian business risks because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 40 of its fiscal 2022 revenues from australia and 2 to a lesser extent business risks relating to the uk where it generated approximately 13 of its fiscal 2022 revenues as a result the company’s business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian and uk markets

while restrictions related to the covid19 pandemic have eased the extent to which it and any similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises may impact the company in the future will depend on among other things the severity duration spread and any reoccurrence of such crises including due to the emergence of new variants the impact of governmental actions and business consumer and customer behavior in response the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate outbreaks and prevent or limit any reoccurrence including the development availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in addition the covid19 pandemic and other similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises may amplify many of the other risk factors disclosed elsewhere in this “item 1a risk factors” 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company is primarily exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt that is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt as of june 30 2022 the foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 345 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the company’s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable however there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company’s reporting currency primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for inclusion in the company’s consolidated financial statements which could in turn have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

risks related to information technology cybersecurity and data protection 

a breach failure or misuse of the company’s network and information systems or other technologies could cause a disruption of services or loss corruption improper access to or disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs loss of revenue reputational damage or other harm to the company’s business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s cdns and network management are important to its business activities and contain the company’s proprietary confidential and sensitive business information including personal data of its customers and personnel the company also relies on third party providers for certain software technology and “cloudbased” systems and services including aws that support a variety of critical business operations in january 2022 the company discovered that one of these systems was the target of persistent cyberattack activity together with an outside cybersecurity firm the company conducted an investigation into the circumstances of the activity to determine its nature scope duration and impacts the company’s analysis indicates that foreign government involvement may be associated with this activity and that data was taken to the company’s knowledge its systems housing customer and financial data were not affected the company has contained the discovered attack continues to conduct its analysis and remediate the issue and to date has not experienced any related interruptions to its business operations or systems at this time the company does not believe the expenses it will incur in connection with its investigation and remediation efforts will be material 

events affecting the company’s systems or other technologies or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies such as computer compromises cyber threats and attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns ransomware and denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or statesponsored or other groups or any combination of the foregoing as well as power and internet outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity terrorist activities war human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems could result in disruption of the company’s services and business andor loss corruption improper access to or disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the company’s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the company’s systems facilities or data or those of third parties with whom the company does business in addition any “bugs” errors or other defects in or the improper implementation of hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the company’s network and information systems or other technologies or compromise information security system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events or other disruptions 

in recent years there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against geopolitical tensions or conflicts such as russia’s invasion of ukraine may further heighten the risk of cybersecurity attacks greater levels of remote work and access to the company’s systems may also adversely impact the effectiveness of the company’s security measures consequently the risks associated with cyberattacks continue to increase particularly as the company’s digital businesses expand the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and activity there is no assurance that cybersecurity threats or activity such as that discovered in january 2022 will not have a material adverse effect in the future countermeasures that the company and its vendors have developed and implemented to protect personal data business information including intellectual property and other confidential information to prevent system disruption data loss or corruption and to prevent or detect security breaches may not be successful in preventing these events particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems have become more sophisticated and change frequently additionally it may be difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time any events affecting the company’s network and information systems or other technologies could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any breaches of the company’s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future threats or activity cyber risk insurance has also become more difficult and expensive to obtain and the company cannot be certain that its current level of insurance or the breadth of its terms and conditions will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems or other technologies or those of third parties upon which its business relies could result in a disruption of its operations including degradation or disruption of service equipment and data damage customer audience or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations and enforcement actions lawsuits remediation costs a loss of or inability to attract new customers audience advertisers or business partners or loss of revenues and other financial losses if any such failure compromise breach interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal and credit card data as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy as well as private individual or class action lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions the company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies andor regulators including the appropriate eu supervisory authority about any actual or perceived data security breach as well as the individuals who are affected by any such breach within strict time periods in addition media or other reports of actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact the company’s brand and reputation and materially affect its business results of operations and financial condition

the indebtedness of the company and certain of its subsidiaries may affect their ability to operate their businesses and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described herein 

as of june 30 2022 news corp had 291 billion of total outstanding indebtedness excluding related party debt with maturities ranging from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2032 including 652 million and 281 million respectively of indebtedness held by its nonwholly owned subsidiaries foxtel and rea group collectively with news corp the “debtors” the indebtedness of the debtors and the terms of their financing arrangements could 1 limit their ability to obtain additional financing in the future 2 make it more difficult for them to satisfy their obligations under the terms of their financing arrangements including the provisions of any relevant debt instruments credit agreements indentures and similar or associated documents collectively the “debt documents” 3 limit their ability to refinance their indebtedness on terms acceptable to them or at all 4 limit their flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which they operate and increase their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 5 require them to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to make interest and principal payments on their debt thereby limiting the availability of their cash flow to fund future investments capital expenditures working capital business activities acquisitions and other general corporate requirements 6 subject them to higher levels of indebtedness than their competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce their flexibility in responding to increased competition and 7 in the case of the company’s fixed rate indebtedness which includes prepayment penalties diminish the company’s ability to benefit from any future decrease in interest rates 

the ability of the debtors to satisfy their debt service obligations including any repurchase obligations and to fund other cash needs will depend on the debtors’ future performance and other factors such as changes in interest rates which have been increasing affecting the debtors’ variable rate indebtedness although the company hedges a portion of this interest rate exposure there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties if the debtors do not generate enough cash to pay their debt service obligations and fund their other cash requirements they may be required to restructure or refinance all or part of their existing debt sell assets borrow more money or raise additional equity any or all of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all the company and its subsidiaries including the debtors may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could exacerbate the effects described elsewhere in this “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition the debtors’ outstanding debt documents contain financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility these covenants include compliance with or maintenance of certain financial tests and ratios and may depending on the applicable debtor and subject to certain exceptions restrict or prohibit such debtor andor its subsidiaries from among other things incurring or guaranteeing debt undertaking certain transactions including certain investments and acquisitions disposing of certain properties or assets including subsidiary stock merging or consolidating with any other person making financial accommodation available entering into certain other financing arrangements creating or permitting certain liens engaging in transactions with affiliates making repayments of certain other loans undergoing fundamental business changes andor paying dividends or making other restricted payments and investments various risks uncertainties and events beyond the debtors’ control could affect their ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any debt documents the lenders or noteholders as applicable may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable debt documents which could result in a crossdefault under other outstanding debt documents and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operation and financial condition

risks related to intellectual property 

theft of the company’s content including digital piracy and signal theft may decrease revenue and adversely affect the company’s business and profitability 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to maintain enforce and monetize the intellectual property rights in its original and acquired content and theft of its brands programming digital content books and other intellectual property affects the value of its content developments in technology including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream duplicate and widely distribute pirated material including from lessregulated countries into the company’s primary markets the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by among other means preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions however piracy is difficult to monitor and prevent and these efforts may be costly and are not always successful particularly as infringers continue to develop tools that undermine security features and enable them to disguise their identities online the proliferation of unauthorized use of the company’s content undermines lawful distribution channels and reduces the revenue that the company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed or not effectively enforced the company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase in addition the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated could make it more difficult for the company to adequately protect its intellectual property which could in turn negatively impact its value and further increase the company’s enforcement costs 

failure by the company to protect certain intellectual property and brands or infringement claims by third parties could adversely impact the company’s business results of operation and financial condition 

the company’s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks trade names copyrights patents domain names trade secrets and other proprietary rights as well as licenses confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to establish obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses the company believes its proprietary trademarks trade names copyrights patents domain names trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position however the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors including licenses relating to sports programming rights settop box technology and related systems the nar license and the fox licenses and suppliers will be enforced or upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the company operates or where its products and services are available efforts to protect and enforce the company’s intellectual property rights may be costly and any failure by the company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect and enforce its or their intellectual property or brands or any infringement claims by third parties could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations or financial condition claims of intellectual property infringement could require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms if such agreements are available at all require the company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property which could in turn require the company to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively even if the company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from its business in addition the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or the addition or loss of significant customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates 12 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 13 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders 14 overall market fluctuations general economic conditions such as inflationary pressures or a general economic slowdown or recession and other external factors including pandemics war such as the war in ukraine and terrorism and 15 changes in the amounts and frequency of dividends or share repurchases if any 

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in fox corporation “fox” andor because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of fox which may result in the diversion of certain corporate opportunities to fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and chair of fox and lachlan k murdoch who serves as the company’s cochairman and executive chair and chief executive officer of fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and fox may agree to implement the company and fox agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s amended and restated bylaws acknowledge that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and fox each of which is referred 

to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s amended and restated bylaws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s amended and restated bylaws to fox instead of the company this could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to fox instead of the company 

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

• a dual class common equity capital structure 

• a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting 

• special stockholders’ meeting to be called only by the board of directors the chairman or a vice or deputy chairman of the board of directors or the holders of not less than 20 of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock 

• the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders’ meeting 

• the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65 of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its bylaws 

• vacancies on the board of directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office 

• certain restrictions on the transfer of the company’s shares and 

• the board of directors to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 

these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust mft which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 389 of the company’s class b common stock as of june 30 2022 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the mft k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional less than one percent of each of the company’s class b common stock and class a common stock as of june 30 2022 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 395 of the company’s class b common stock as of june 30 2022 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the mft increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the mft will be adopted and proposals that the mft does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock 

the company’s board of directors has approved a 1 billion stock repurchase program for the company’s class a and class b common stock which could increase the percentage of class b common stock held by the mft the company has entered into a stockholders agreement with the mft pursuant to which the company and the mft have agreed not to take actions that would result in the mft and murdoch family members together owning more than 44 of the outstanding voting power of the shares of class b common stock or would increase the mft’s voting power by more than 175 in any rolling 12month period the 

mft would forfeit votes to the extent necessary to ensure that the mft and the murdoch family collectively do not exceed 44 of the outstanding voting power of the shares of class b common stock except where a murdoch family member votes their own shares differently from the mft on any matter

 not meaningful 

revenues —revenues increased 1027 million or 11 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 primarily driven by the increase at the digital real estate services segment primarily due to higher real estate revenues and the acquisition of mortgage choice at the dow jones segment primarily due to the increase in circulation and subscription revenues which includes the impacts from the acquisitions of ibd and opis and higher advertising revenues at the news media segment primarily due to higher advertising and circulation and subscription revenues and at the book publishing segment primarily due to the acquisition of hmh books and media the increases were partially offset by the decrease at the subscription video services segment due to the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations as higher streaming and advertising revenues more than offset lower residential subscription revenues the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2022 resulted in a revenue increase of approximately 110 million

operating expenses —operating expenses increased 293 million or 6 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the increase was primarily driven by higher expenses at the book publishing segment due to the acquisition of hmh books and media and higher manufacturing and freight costs related to increased sales volumes the mix of titles and the impact of ongoing supply chain and inflationary pressures the increase was also driven by the dow jones segment due to higher employee costs and the impact from recent acquisitions higher costs at the news media segment primarily due to higher costs associated with talktv and higher print production costs in the uk as well as at the digital real estate services segment due to higher employee costs the company has generally observed a very competitive labor market which has led to higher compensation and hiring costs for attracting and retaining highly qualified employees at some of its businesses and is expected to continue to impact the company’s cost base in the near term the increases were partially offset by lower expenses at the subscription video services segment primarily due to the absence of 57 million of additional sports programming rights and production costs recognized in the prior year that were deferred from fiscal 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic “covid19” 

and the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations partially offset by higher sports and entertainment programming rights costs due to increased content availability the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of 76 million or 2 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 

selling general and administrative —selling general and administrative increased 338 million or 10 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021 the increase in selling general and administrative for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 was primarily due to increased expenses at the digital real estate services segment driven by the acquisitions of mortgage choice and rea india higher employee costs at both move and rea group and increased marketing expenses at move the increase was also driven by higher costs at the dow jones segment due to the impact of recent acquisitions including a 25 million impact from opis and cmarelated transaction costs increased employee costs and increased sales and marketing costs the increase was partially offset by lower costs of 67 million in the other segment primarily driven by lower equitybased compensation costs largely related to stock price performance and lower onetime legal settlement costs the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against local currencies resulted in a selling general and administrative decrease of 61 million or 2 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 as compared to fiscal 2021

management assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of available evidence it has been determined that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions may not be realized and therefore a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets 

net income —net income was 760 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 as compared to 389 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 an improvement of 371 million or 95 primarily driven by higher total segment ebitda lower impairment and restructuring charges and lower losses from equity affiliates partially offset by lower other net and higher interest expense

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation 

free cash flow available to news corporation is a nongaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures “free cash flow” less rea group free cash flow plus cash dividends received from rea group free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow 

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions dividend payouts and repurchasing stock the company believes excluding rea group’s free cash flow and including dividends received from rea group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group’s cash balance the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group which has generally been lower than the company’s unadjusted free cash flow 

a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow available to news corporation 



free cash flow available to news corporation decreased 68 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 to 663 million from 731 million in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher capital expenditures and higher rea group free cash flow partially offset by higher net cash provided by operating activities as discussed above and higher dividends received from rea group

the table also excludes the company’s pension obligations other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 29 million and 35 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 12 million in fiscal 2023 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s returns in fiscal 2022 and those expected beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 8 million in fiscal 2023 see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

other significant ongoing expenses or cash requirements for each of the company’s segments are discussed above in “overview of the company’s businesses” the company generally expects to fund these short and longterm cash requirements with internallygenerated funds and cash and cash equivalents on hand 

contingencies 

the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations including those discussed in note 16—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters fees expenses fines penalties judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable see note 16—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid however these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress or as settlements or litigations occur 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

the company’s longlived assets include goodwill finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring a business and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

under asc 350 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill 

for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates longterm growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

the performance of the company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in no impairments to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2022 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 80 to 190 longterm growth rates ranging from 10 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 025 to 70 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 50 to 100 significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement see note 8—goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding changes in these inputs and assumptions compared to prior fiscal years 

as of june 30 2022 there were no reporting units with goodwill atrisk for future impairment the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment 

programming costs 

costs incurred in acquiring programming rights are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” programming rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program which requires significant judgment the pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors if initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership an accelerated method of amortization is used the company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be recognized prospectively the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect fair value changes in circumstances may result in a writedown of the asset to fair value the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired for sports contracts with dedicated channels the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes its current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in 

the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax expense benefit

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income are calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the weighted average expected longterm rate of return of 43 for fiscal 2023 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 17 equities 76 fixedincome securities and 7 cash and other investments 

the company recorded nil and 1 million in net periodic benefit income costs in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 respectively the company utilizes the full yieldcurve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 41 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2023 net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2022 and 2021 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 



the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 43 for fiscal 2023 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2022 were approximately 459 million which decreased from approximately 542 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2021 this net decrease of 83 million was primarily due to currency movements and unrecognized losses amortized during fiscal 2022 lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans 

the company made contributions of 29 million and 35 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2022 and 2021 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2022 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 12 million in fiscal 2023 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 18—other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 



recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency exchange rates interest rates stock prices and credit 

when deemed appropriate the company uses derivative financial instruments such as crosscurrency interest rate swaps interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures the primary market risks managed by the company through the use of derivative instruments include 

• foreign currency exchange rate risk arising primarily through foxtel debt group borrowings denominated in us dollars payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights and 

• interest rate risk arising from fixed and floating rate foxtel debt group and news corporation borrowings the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and other relevant market risks the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings generally reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital 

requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation risk on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from their functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2022 and 2021 



based on the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 59 million and 11 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 13 million and 1 million respectively on an annual basis 

derivatives and hedging 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2022 the company entered into an interest rate swap derivative with a 500 million notional amount to exchange the floating rate interest component of its term a loans for a fixed rate of 2083 this interest rate swap derivative is accounted for as a cash flow hedge under asc 815 “derivatives and hedging” “asc 815” 

as of june 30 2022 the foxtel group operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 345 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars the foxtel group utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the exchange rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt a portion of the swaps are designated as fair value hedges while the remaining swaps are accounted for as cash flow derivatives under asc 815 as of june 30 2022 the total notional value of these crosscurrency interest rate swaps was 350 million with approximately 280 million accounted for as cash flow derivatives and 70 million designated as fair value hedges foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange rate risk related to us dollar payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was 21 million as of june 30 2022 

some of the derivative instruments in place may create volatility during the fiscal year as they are markedtomarket according to accounting rules which may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impacts on the underlying transactions are realized 

the table below provides further details of the sensitivity of the company’s derivative financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk as of june 30 2022 in millions 



any resulting changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions primarily us dollar denominated liabilities impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates the ability to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle 

interest rate risk 

the company’s current financing arrangements and facilities include 2063 million of outstanding fixedrate debt and 939 million of outstanding variablerate bank facilities before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements fixed and variablerate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates a change in the market interest rate or yield of fixedrate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt while a change in the market interest rate of variablerate debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt in connection with these borrowings news corporation has entered into an interest rate swap cash flow hedge to fix the floating rate interest component of its term a loans and the foxtel group has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap us dollar denominated fixed rate interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate payments as discussed above the foxtel group utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the foxtel group has also utilized certain derivative instruments to swap australian dollar denominated variable interest rate payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rate payments as of june 30 2022 the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately a350 million and 500 million for foxtel group and news corporation borrowings respectively refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk refer to note 11—financial instruments and fair value measurements for further detail 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 109 million as of june 30 2022 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in income of approximately 11 million before tax 

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2022 or june 30 2021 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2022 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

governmental regulation 

general

australian media regulation 

the company’s subscription television interests are subject to australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry including the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth the “broadcasting services act” and the telecommunications act 1997 cth the “telecommunications act” and associated codes the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority 

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the broadcasting services act subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50 of the australian population or the rights are held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters and b other parts of the broadcasting services act that may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities foxtel is also subject to various consumer protection regimes under the telecommunications act and associated codes which apply to foxtel as a telecommunications service provider 

data privacy and security 

the company’s business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us certain of the company’s websites mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits the collection of personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent in addition the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements more state and local governments are also expanding enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach for example the california consumer privacy act “ccpa” and california privacy rights act “cpra” which will amend the ccpa in january 2023 establish certain transparency rules put greater restrictions on how the company can collect use and share personal information of california residents and provide california residents with certain rights regarding their personal information the ccpa and forthcoming cpra provide for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches similarly the recentlyenacted virginia consumer data protection act “cdpa” imposes transparency and other obligations with respect to personal data of virginia consumers and provides virginia residents with similar rights with the exception of a private right of action 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union the uk and australia for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which provides a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and the uk adopted the data protection act of 2018 the “uk dpa” implementing the gdpr  the gdpr and the uk dpa expand the regulation of the collection processing use sharing and security of personal data contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthen the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continue to restrict the transborder flow of such data require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals require mandatory data breach reporting and notification significantly increase maximum penalties for noncompliance up to 20 million euros or 17 million pounds as applicable or 4 of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year whichever is higher and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities the european union also plans to replace its existing eprivacy directive with a new eprivacy regulation that will complement the gdpr and amend certain rules including with respect to cookies and other similar technologies that the company utilizes to obtain information from visitors to the company’s various digital 

properties it is not yet clear whether the uk will make corresponding changes to its existing privacy and electronic communications regulations which implemented the eprivacy directive in the uk 

the company and some of its service providers rely on certain mechanisms to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data such as the european union standard contractual clauses that are evolving and often subject to uncertainty and legal challenges in june 2021 the european commission adopted new sets of european union standard contractual clauses which regulate the relationship between controller and processor in accordance with the gdpr and international data transfers to a third country in the absence of an adequacy decision under the gdpr the european data protection board also adopted recommendations on measures that supplement data transfer tools to ensure compliance with the level of personal data protection required in europe including requirements for data exporters to assess the risks related to the transfer of personal data outside the european economic area and to implement if necessary additional contractual organizational and technical measures such as encryption and pseudonymization such evolving frameworks could cause the company to incur additional costs require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services 

in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain in flux and evolving in the united states and internationally moreover data privacy and security laws vary between local state federal and international jurisdictions and may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press a press recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established once approved by the press recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers in addition to the press recognition panel certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is commenced the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances 

press regulator impress was recognized as an approved regulator by the press recognition panel on october 25 2016 however publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso in september 2014 ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code of practice and levy fines of up to £1 million ipso has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members including the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by among other means preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions the company also seeks to limit such threat to its intellectual property by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws however effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock 

risks relating to the company’s businesses and operations 

the company operates in a highly competitive business environment and its success depends on its ability to compete effectively including by responding to evolving technologies and changes in consumer and customer behavior 

the company faces significant competition from other providers of news information entertainment and real estaterelated services including both traditional and new providers see “business overview” for more information regarding competition within each of the company’s segments this competition continues to intensify as a result of changes in technologies platforms and business models and corresponding changes in consumer and customer behavior and the company may be adversely affected if consumers or customers migrate to other alternatives for example enhanced internet capabilities developments in content distribution platforms and the emergence of new media channels have led to alternative methods for the delivery storage and consumption of content which have increased the number of choices available to consumers for content consumption and have in turn adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact demand for the company’s newspapers television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay consumption of the company’s content on thirdparty delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates these trends and developments have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect both the company’s circulation and subscription revenue and in turn advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from the company as well as increase subscriber acquisition retention and other costs 

technological developments have in some cases also increased competition by lowering barriers to entry for example content providers are now able to compete more easily with the company’s paytv business via directtoconsumer offerings as internet streaming capabilities have enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated content platforms and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing certain types of content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company often at a lower cost additional digital distribution channels such as online retailers and digital marketplaces have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s business models including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

in order to compete effectively the company must differentiate and distinguish its brands and their associated products and services respond to and develop new technologies distribution channels and platforms products and services and anticipate and consistently respond to changes in consumer and customer needs tastes and behavior which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on brand awareness reputation and acceptance of its highquality differentiated content and other products and services the breadth depth and accuracy of information provided by its digital real estate services and professional information businesses as well as its wide array of digital offerings in order to retain and grow its audiences consumers and subscribers however consumer tastes change frequently and are difficult to predict and when faced with a multitude of choices consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source quality or reliability online traffic and product and service purchases are also driven by internet search results referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that are changed frequently and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the company’s businesses including those affecting how the company’s content apps products and services are discovered prioritized displayed and monetized could impede the company’s ability to compete effectively by significantly decreasing traffic to the company’s digital properties lowering advertiser interest in those properties increasing costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lowering product sales and subscriptions a shortfall in the expected popularity or discoverability of the company’s content or other products and services could have an adverse effect on its business financial condition or results of operations 

the company expects to continue to pursue new strategic initiatives and develop new and enhanced products and services in order to remain competitive such as its streaming services its recently launched transformation initiative and the continued expansion into various adjacencies at its digital real estate services businesses the company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in order to implement these strategies and develop these new products and services including 

costs to continue developing and improving its streaming services and costs related to its transformation initiative as well as other costs to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies and attract and retain employees with the necessary knowledge and skills there can be no assurance any strategic initiatives products and services will be successful in the manner or time period or at the cost the company expects or that it will realize the anticipated benefits it expects to achieve the failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources fewer regulatory burdens better competitive positions in certain areas greater operating capabilities greater access to sources of content data technology or other services or strategic relationships andor easier access to financing which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology consumer and customer needs preferences and behavior and market conditions continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the company operates may increase these advantages including through greater scale financial leverage andor access to content data technology and other offerings if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising and its ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors including 1 demand for the company’s products and services 2 audience fragmentation 3 digital advertising trends 4 its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers 5 general economic and business conditions 6 demographics of the customer base 7 advertising rates 8 advertising effectiveness and 9 maintaining its brand strength and reputation 

demand for the company’s products and services is evaluated based on a variety of metrics for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits number of users and user engagement any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand particularly demand generated through new platforms may lead to undermeasurement and in turn lower advertising pricing and spending 

the popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news entertainment and other content and the ability of digital advertising offerings to deliver targeted advertising promptly has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms large digital platforms in particular such as facebook google and amazon which have extensive audience reach audience data and targeting capabilities have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market in recent years and the company expects this trend to continue the shift to digital media has significantly impacted the company’s print advertising revenues which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media platforms such as online and mobile social networking have also increased the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising in addition in the past rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising as a result increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices has added and may continue to add additional pricing pressure consequently despite continued growth in the company’s digital advertising revenues such revenues may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure new thirdparty delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control loss of a direct relationship with consumers and adversely affect the company’s ability to understand its audience andor collect and apply data for targeted advertising the company’s digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies such as google’s ad manager which if interrupted or meaningfully changed or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure could adversely impact advertising revenues in addition evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising as well as the development and implementation of technology regulations policies and practices that adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of its advertising including blocking changing the location of or obscuring the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices browsing incognito blocking or deleting cookies and ip addresses the phaseout of browser 

support for third party cookies and mobile operating system identifiers used for advertising purposes as well as optin requirements may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage and grow digital audiences collect and leverage better user data develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content and video and mobile advertising and demonstrate the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings 

the company’s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions which tend to be cyclical as well as election and other news cycles natural disasters including extreme weather pandemics including the novel coronavirus “covid19” pandemic and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism have led and could continue to lead to greater economic uncertainty and reduced spending by advertisers the company experienced a material negative impact on advertising revenues primarily in the first half of fiscal 2021 because of weakness in the advertising market due to covid19 in addition certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company’s advertising revenues including retail technology and finance some of these sectors such as retail are more sensitive to weakness in economic conditions as well as increased online competition a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer reduced demand for the company’s offerings a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the inability to obtain and retain sports entertainment and other programming rights and content could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company’s operating businesses and costs could also increase upon renewal 

competition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense and the success of certain of the company’s operating businesses including its subscription television business depends on among other things their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof such as music rights that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices the subscription television industry including the company’s subscription television business has experienced higher programming costs due to among other things 1 increases imposed by sports entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts 2 the carriage of incremental programming including new services and svod programming and 3 increased competition from other digital media companies including streaming services for the rights to popular or exclusive content certain of the company’s operating businesses including its subscription television business are party to contracts for sports entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties including professional sports leagues and teams television and motion picture producers and other content providers these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms and as they expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought in the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire the financial and other terms such as exclusivity rights under these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the company’s control such as changes in the company’s bargaining power or in the industry and in order to retain or extend such rights the company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs furthermore third parties may outbid the company for those rights andor for any new programming offerings in addition as other content providers develop their own competing services they may be unwilling to provide the company with access to certain content for example professional sports leagues or teams as well as programmers and distributors such as viacomcbs and disney have created and may continue to create their own directtoconsumer offerings further consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the company andor increase the scale and bargaining power of those providers the loss of rights or any adverse changes to existing rights including loss of exclusivity may adversely affect the company’s ability to differentiate its services and the breadth or quality of the company’s content offerings including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or in some cases loss of customers or audiences which could in turn adversely affect its revenues in addition the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates the longterm nature of some of the company’s content commitments may also limit its flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and economic conditions and the market segments in which it operates 

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions investments and divestitures that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses operations and systems including financial reporting internal controls and information technology in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees customers and suppliers 4 with respect to investments risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business 5 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 6 in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of specific economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries 7 expenses and liabilities both known and unknown associated with the acquired businesses or investments 8 in some cases increased regulation and 9 in some cases lower liquidity as a result of the use of cash or incurrence of debt to fund such acquisition or investment if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing businesses the company’s business results of operations financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected and the company may be required to record noncash impairment charges for the writedown of certain acquired assets and investments the company’s ability to continue to make acquisitions depends on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices and whether restrictions are imposed by regulations and competition for certain types of acquisitions is significant 

the company has also divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition these include among others the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms disruption to its business andor diversion of management attention from other business concerns loss of key employees difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business and indemnification or other postclosing claims

macroeconomic and market risks 

the covid19 pandemic and other similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial position

the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic and other similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises will depend on among other things the severity duration spread and any reoccurrence of such crises the impact of governmental actions and business and consumer behavior in response the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate outbreaks and prevent or limit any reoccurrence including the development availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in addition the covid19 pandemic and other similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises may amplify many of the other risk factors disclosed elsewhere in this “item 1a risk factors” 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone and may in the future experience periods of economic and market weakness and uncertainty including as a result of the covid19 pandemic trade disputes between a number of countries and higher inflation these conditions have resulted in among other things a tightening of and in some cases more limited access to the credit and capital markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a decline in the real estate market such weakness and uncertainty and associated market disruptions have often led to broader prolonged economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures lower demand for the company’s products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity any continued or recurring economic weakness is likely to have a similar impact on the company’s business and reduce its circulation and subscription advertising real estate consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 42 of its fiscal 2021 revenues from australia as a result the company’s business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market including for example weakness in the australian residential real estate market which has led and may in the future lead to lower listing volumes at rea group the company also generated approximately 14 of its fiscal 2021 revenues from the uk which continues to experience political regulatory economic and market uncertainty following its exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” while the uk and the european union have entered into a trade and cooperation agreement 

which provides a framework for the uk’s future relationship with the european union significant political and economic uncertainty remains as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation the impact on the company’s business of any treaties laws and regulations that replace the existing european union counterparts or other governmental or regulatory actions taken by the uk or the european union in connection with or subsequent to brexit cannot be predicted including whether or not regulators will continue to approve or impose material conditions on the company’s business activities in addition brexit may lead to a downturn in the uk or other european economies and could lead to lower access to european markets in general any of these effects and others the company cannot anticipate could have a material adverse effect on its businesses in the uk and elsewhere 

in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms although the company believes that its cash on hand operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for at least the next 12 months there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt as of june 30 2021 the foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 354 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the company’s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable however there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company’s reporting currency primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for inclusion in the company’s consolidated financial statements which could in turn have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

risks related to information technology cybersecurity and data protection 

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss improper access to or disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs loss of revenue reputational damage or other harm to the company’s business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s content delivery networks and network management are important to its business activities and contain the company’s proprietary confidential and sensitive business information including personal data of its customers and personnel the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and “cloudbased” systems and services that support a variety of business operations network and information systemsrelated events affecting the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies such as computer compromises cyber threats and attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns ransomware and denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or statesponsored or other groups or any combination of the foregoing as well as power and internet outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather which may occur with increasing frequency and intensity terrorist activities war human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems could result in disruption of the company’s services and business andor loss corruption improper access to or disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the company’s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the company’s systems facilities or data or those of third parties with whom the company does business in addition any design or manufacturing defects in or the improper implementation of hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the company’s network and information systems or compromise information security system redundancy may be 

ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events or other disruptions 

in recent years there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against as a result of the covid19 pandemic remote work and remote access to the company’s systems has increased significantly which may adversely impact the effectiveness of the company’s security measures consequently the risks associated with such an event continue to increase particularly as the company’s digital businesses expand the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date individually or in the aggregate however there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity threat or incident that has a material adverse effect in the future while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data business information including intellectual property and other confidential information to prevent system disruption data loss or corruption and to prevent or detect security breaches such measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently additionally it may be difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the company’s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents cyber risk insurance has also become more difficult and expensive to obtain and the company cannot be certain that its current level of insurance or the breadth of its terms and conditions will continue to be available on economically reasonable terms 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies could result in a disruption of its operations including degradation or disruption of service equipment damage customer audience or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations and enforcement actions lawsuits remediation costs a loss of or inability to attract new customers audience advertisers or business partners or loss of revenues and other financial losses if any such failure compromise breach interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal and credit card data as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy as well as private individual or class action lawsuits the company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies andor regulators including the appropriate eu supervisory authority about any actual or perceived data security breach as well as the individuals who are affected by any such incident within strict time periods in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact the company’s brand and reputation and materially affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

failure to comply with complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data use and data protection could have an adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition and results of operations 

the company’s business activities are subject to various and increasing laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which have implications for how such data is managed many of these laws and regulations are increasingly complex and continue to evolve and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application moreover data privacy and security laws may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with these laws and regulations could be costly and resourceintensive require the company to change its business practices or limit or restrict aspects of the company’s business in a manner adverse to its business operations including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted datadriven advertising offerings the company’s failure to comply even if inadvertent or in good faith or as a result of a compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems by a third party could result in exposure to enforcement by us federal state or local or foreign governments or private parties as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage examples of such laws include the european union’s gdpr and the uk dpa each of which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and the uk respectively and significantly increases maximum penalties for noncompliance california’s ccpa and forthcoming cpra and virginia’s cdpa which establish certain transparency rules put greater restrictions on the collection use and sharing of personal information of their respective state residents and provide such 

residents with certain rights regarding their personal information see “governmental regulation—data privacy and security” for more information 

risks related to financial results and position 

the indebtedness of the company and certain of its subsidiaries may affect their ability to operate their businesses and may have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial condition and results of operations the company and its subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt which could further exacerbate the risks described herein 

as of june 30 2021 news corp had 215 billion of total outstanding indebtedness excluding related party debt with maturities ranging from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2029 including 854 million and 314 million respectively of indebtedness held by its nonwholly owned subsidiaries foxtel and rea group collectively with news corp the “debtors” the indebtedness of the debtors and the terms of their financing arrangements could 1 limit their ability to obtain additional financing in the future 2 make it more difficult for them to satisfy their obligations under the terms of their financing arrangements including the provisions of any relevant debt instruments credit agreements indentures and similar or associated documents collectively the “debt documents” 3 limit their ability to refinance their indebtedness on terms acceptable to them or at all 4 limit their flexibility to plan for and adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which they operate and increase their vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 5 require them to dedicate a substantial portion of their cash flow to make interest and principal payments on their debt thereby limiting the availability of their cash flow to fund future investments capital expenditures working capital business activities acquisitions and other general corporate requirements 6 subject them to higher levels of indebtedness than their competitors which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce their flexibility in responding to increased competition and 7 in the case of the company’s fixed rate indebtedness which includes prepayment penalties diminish the company’s ability to benefit from any future decrease in interest rates 

the ability of the debtors to satisfy their debt service obligations including any repurchase obligations and to fund other cash needs will depend on the debtors’ future performance and other factors such as changes in interest rates affecting the debtors’ variable rate indebtedness although the company hedges a portion of this interest rate exposure there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties if the debtors do not generate enough cash to pay their debt service obligations and fund their other cash requirements they may be required to restructure or refinance all or part of their existing debt sell assets borrow more money or raise additional equity any or all of which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all the company and its subsidiaries including the debtors may also be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future which could exacerbate the effects described elsewhere in this “item 1a risk factors” 

in addition the debtors’ outstanding debt documents contain financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility these covenants include compliance with or maintenance of certain financial tests and ratios and may depending on the applicable debtor and subject to certain exceptions restrict or prohibit such debtor andor its subsidiaries from among other things incurring or guaranteeing debt undertaking certain transactions including certain investments and acquisitions disposing of certain properties or assets including subsidiary stock merging or consolidating with any other person making financial accommodation available entering into certain other financing arrangements creating or permitting certain liens engaging in transactions with affiliates making repayments of certain other loans undergoing fundamental business changes andor paying dividends or making other restricted payments and investments various risks uncertainties and events beyond the debtors’ control could affect their ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any debt documents the lenders or noteholders as applicable may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable debt documents which could result in a crossdefault under other outstanding debt documents and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operation and financial condition 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of changes in the company’s industry and market conditions the company has recognized and may in the future recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill intangible assets investments and other longlived assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s results of operations and in the case of cash restructuring charges its financial condition impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the company’s taxes including its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and deduct certain interest costs the company’s management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company’s cash flows in order to determine whether based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an 

impairment in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the business environment credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions for example any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue or subscribers the expected popularity of the content for which the company has acquired rights andor consumer acceptance of its products could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or other longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required and any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxation in us federal state and local jurisdictions and various nonus jurisdictions including australia and the uk the company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws regulations practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on among other things the geographic mix of the company’s profits and losses changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company’s deferred tax assets new proposals at the us federal level to increase the us corporate tax rate and minimum taxes on nonus income could if enacted have an adverse impact on the company’s future tax rate and increase its tax provision the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances if among other things adverse economic conditions negatively impact the company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets evaluating and estimating the company’s tax provision current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

the company’s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns or positions taken by the company and as a result taxrelated settlements or litigation may occur resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or its taxes in the future could increase which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition 

the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd continues to develop a framework of globally coordinated reforms to address the tax challenges arising from globalization and the digitalization of the economy including expanded taxing rights for countries and the adoption of a global minimum taxation regime the scope and application of the framework continues to evolve and its outcome may alter aspects of how the company’s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business several jurisdictions have separately enacted new digital services taxes which have had limited impact on the company’s overall tax obligations however the company continues to monitor proposals as they are introduced if new taxes on digital services are imposed on the company it could have an adverse impact on its business and financial performance 

risks related to legal and regulatory matters 

adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company’s business practices and operating results 

from time to time the company is party to litigation as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies including with respect to antitrust tax data privacy and security intellectual property employment and other matters see note 16 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm andor significant monetary damages injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition as well as the company’s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted in addition regardless of merit or outcome such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in law governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests for example the company’s australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy regulation or legislation or the application or enforcement thereof applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general see “governmental regulation—australian media regulation” for more information in addition the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press and the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities see “governmental regulation—uk press regulation” and “—uk radio broadcasting regulation” respectively for more information laws and regulations may vary between local state federal and international jurisdictions and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply 

risks related to intellectual property 

theft of the company’s content including digital piracy and signal theft may decrease revenue and adversely affect the company’s business and profitability 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content and theft of its brands programming digital content books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content developments in technology including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream duplicate and widely distribute pirated material including from other lessregulated countries into the company’s primary markets the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by among other means preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions however these efforts may be costly and are not always successful particularly as infringers continue to develop tools that undermine security features and enable them to disguise their identities online the proliferation of unauthorized use of the company’s content undermines lawful distribution channels and reduces the revenue that the company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed or not effectively enforced the company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase in addition the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated could make it more difficult for the company to adequately protect its intellectual property which could in turn negatively impact its value and further increase the company’s enforcement costs 

failure by the company to protect certain intellectual property and brands or infringement claims by third parties could adversely impact the company’s business results of operation and financial condition 

the company’s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks trade names copyrights patents domain names trade secrets and other proprietary rights as well as licenses confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements to establish obtain and protect the intellectual property and brand names used in their businesses the company believes its proprietary trademarks trade names copyrights patents domain names trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position however the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights or those of its licensors including licenses relating to sports programming rights settop box technology and related systems the nar license and the fox licenses and suppliers will be enforced or upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the company operates or where its products and services are available efforts to protect and enforce the company’s intellectual property rights may be costly and any failure by the company or its licensors and suppliers to effectively protect and enforce its or their intellectual property or brands or any infringement claims by third parties could adversely impact the company’s business results of operations or financial condition claims of intellectual property infringement could require the company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms if such agreements are available at all require the company to spend substantial sums to defend against or settle such claims or to satisfy any judgment rendered against it or cease any further use of the applicable intellectual property which could in turn require the 

company to change its business practices or offerings and limit its ability to compete effectively even if the company believes any such challenges or claims are without merit they can be timeconsuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from its business in addition the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims 

risks related to the company’s common stock 

the market price of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or the addition or loss of significant customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates 12 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 13 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders 14 overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions and 15 changes in the amounts and frequency of dividends or share repurchases if any 

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in fox corporation “fox” andor because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of fox which may result in the diversion of certain corporate opportunities to fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and chairman of fox and lachlan k murdoch who serves as the company’s cochairman and executive chairman and chief executive officer of fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and fox may agree to implement the company and fox agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s amended and restated bylaws acknowledge that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s amended and restated bylaws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s amended and restated bylaws to fox instead of the company this could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to fox instead of the company 

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws the company’s fourth amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

• a dual class common equity capital structure 

• a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting 

• special stockholders’ meeting to be called only by the board of directors the chairman or a vice or deputy chairman of the board of directors or the holders of not less than 20 of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock 

• the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders’ meeting 

• the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65 of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its bylaws 

• vacancies on the board of directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office 

• certain restrictions on the transfer of the company’s shares and 

• the board of directors to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 

these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 june 2015 june 2018 and again in june 2021 pursuant to the fourth amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2022 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of june 30 2021 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of june 30 2021 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of june 30 2021 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the fourth amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions dividend payouts and repurchasing stock the company believes excluding rea group’s free cash flow and including dividends received from rea group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group’s cash balance the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group which has generally been lower than the company’s unadjusted free cash flow 

a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period

d the company leases office facilities warehouse facilities printing plants satellite services and equipment these leases which are classified as operating leases are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2048 amounts reflected represent only the company’s lease obligations for which it has firm commitments 

e the company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services the company’s satellite transponder services arrangements extend through fiscal 2032 and are accounted for as operating or finance leases based on the underlying terms of those arrangements 

f see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

g reflects the company’s expected future interest payments on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at june 30 2021 such rates are subject to change in future periods see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

the table also excludes the company’s pension obligations other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 35 million and 30 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 15 million in fiscal 2022 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2021 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 8 million in fiscal 2022 see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

contingencies 

the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations including those discussed in note 16—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the 

outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters fees expenses fines penalties judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable see note 16—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid however these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress or as settlements or litigations occur 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

the company’s longlived assets include goodwill finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring a business and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological changes or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

under asc 350 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates longterm growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

the performance of the company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in no impairments to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2021 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 80 to 220 longterm growth rates ranging from 00 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 025 to 60 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 50 to 100 significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

as of june 30 2021 there were no reporting units with goodwill atrisk for future impairment the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

programming costs 

costs incurred in acquiring programming rights are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” programming rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program the pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors if initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership an accelerated method of amortization is used the company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be recognized prospectively the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect fair value changes in circumstances may result in a writedown of the asset to fair value the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired for sports contracts with dedicated channels the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes its current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax expense benefit 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the weighted average expected longterm rate of return of 37 for fiscal 2022 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 20 equities 73 fixedincome securities and 7 cash and other investments 

the company recorded 1 million and 7 million in net periodic benefit income costs in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the company utilizes the full yieldcurve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 21 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2022 net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2021 and 2020 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 



the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 37 for fiscal 2022 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2021 were approximately 542 million which increased from approximately 529 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2020 this increase of 13 million was primarily due to currency movements partially offset by unrecognized losses amortized during fiscal 2021 lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and have a minimal impact on benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans 

the company made contributions of 35 million and 30 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2021 and 2020 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2021 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 15 million in fiscal 2022 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 18—other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 



recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates interest rates stock prices and credit 

when deemed appropriate the company uses derivative financial instruments such as crosscurrency interest rate swaps interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures the primary market risks managed by the company through the use of derivative instruments include 

• foreign currency exchange rate risk arising primarily through foxtel debt group borrowings denominated in us dollars payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights and 

• interest rate risk arising from fixed and floating rate foxtel debt group borrowings the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk interest rate risk and other relevant market risks the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation risk on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2021 and 2020 



based on the fiscal year ended june 30 2021 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 53 million and 11 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 11 million and 1 million respectively on an annual basis 

derivatives and hedging 

as of june 30 2021 the foxtel group operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 354 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars the foxtel group utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as both cash flow derivatives and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the exchange rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the total notional value of these crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow derivatives and fair value hedges were approximately 280 million and 70 million respectively as of june 30 2021 foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange rate risk related to us dollar payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was 18 million as of june 30 2021 

some of the derivative instruments in place may create volatility during the fiscal year as they are markedtomarket according to accounting rules which may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impact on the underlying transactions are realized 

the table below provides further details of the sensitivity of the company’s derivative financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk as of june 30 2021 in millions 



any resulting changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions primarily us dollar denominated liabilities impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates the ability to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle 

interest rate risk 

the company’s current financing arrangements and facilities include 1607 million of outstanding fixedrate debt and 606 million of outstanding variablerate bank facilities before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements fixed and variablerate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates a change in the market interest rate or yield of fixedrate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt while a change in the market interest rate of variablerate debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt in connection with these borrowings the foxtel group has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap us dollar denominated fixed rate interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate payments as discussed above the foxtel group utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as both cash flow derivatives and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to swap australian dollar denominated variable interest rate payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rate payments as of june 30 2021 the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately a300 million refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 164 million as of june 30 2021 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in income of approximately 16 million before tax 

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2021 or june 30 2020 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2021 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union the uk and australia for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and the uk adopted the data protection act of 2018 the “uk dpa” implementing the gdpr  fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25 2018 the gdpr and the uk dpa expand the regulation of the collection processing use sharing and security of personal data contain stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthen the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continue to restrict the transborder flow of such data require companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals require mandatory data breach reporting and notification significantly increase maximum penalties for noncompliance up to 20 million euros or 17 million pounds as applicable or 4 of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year whichever is higher and increase the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication eprivacy directive with a regulation to among other things amend the current directive’s rules on the use of cookies and enduser consent 

in july 2020 the european court of justice invalidated the privacy shield one of the legal mechanisms for the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states the company relies on the privacy shield framework for one business unit operating an advertising exchange and certain of the company’s service providers also rely on the privacy shield as a result the company will need to put in place and work with some of its third party service providers to implement alternative legal mechanisms for the affected crossborder personal data transfers the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data including the european union standard contractual clauses are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted could cause the company to incur additional costs require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services 

in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain in flux and evolving in the united states and internationally moreover data privacy and security laws vary between local state federal and international jurisdictions and may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press a press recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established once approved by 

the press recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers in addition to the press recognition panel certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is commenced the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances 

press regulator impress was recognized as an approved regulator by the press recognition panel on october 25 2016 however publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso in september 2014 ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code of practice and levy fines of up to £1 million ipso has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members including the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance 

uk radio broadcasting regulation 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions the company also seeks to limit such threat by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws however effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock 

the ongoing novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic and other similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial position 

the ongoing covid19 outbreak and other similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises and the resulting responses of governments businesses and consumers could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial position the covid19 pandemic has led to the implementation of unprecedented and wideranging measures by international federal state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus including quarantines shelterinplace and other social distancing orders event cancellations travel restrictions school shutdowns and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations the impact of the covid19 pandemic and measures to prevent its spread have in turn created significant economic volatility uncertainty and disruption and have subjected the company’s businesses to a number of risks including but not limited to the following 

• lower revenue and profitability  advertising revenues have been and are expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the recent economic downturn resulting from the covid19 pandemic and reduced spending by advertisers particularly in the travel retail entertainment and real estate industries business curtailments closures and other operational changes and shelterinplace orders have also caused and may continue to cause a decline in among other things new listing and other real estate revenues sales of print books and newspapers live journalism event revenues and commercial subscription revenues and new subscriber acquisitions at the subscription video services segment subscription revenues from broadcast and kayo subscribers in the subscription video services segment have also been and may continue to be adversely affected by the cancellation or postponement of sports events for which the company has broadcast rights and other disruptions in the creation and availability of film and television programming caused by covid19 in addition profitability in future periods may be adversely impacted even though some previously postponed events have restarted as the company has resumed recognizing programming amortization expense for those events but may not generate sufficient incremental subscription and advertising revenues to offset these costs and compensate for prior losses it is possible in some cases that revenue andor profitability may not return to prepandemic levels 

while the company has seen growth in some areas of its business during the covid19 pandemic including digital subscribers at its newspaper businesses and ebook sales at its book publishing segment driven in part by the current news environment and other pandemicrelated circumstances this growth may not be sustainable particularly in the event of a prolonged economic downturn 

• disruptions in the company’s supply chain  the company’s supply chain including its printing facilities as well as the printing manufacturing and other facilities and operations of its thirdparty suppliers and vendors may be disrupted by facility closures reductions in operating hours labor shortages and changes in operating procedures similarly the covid19 pandemic may negatively affect the company’s distribution and logistics providers’ ability to operate or increase their operating costs economic disruption and uncertainty may also cause the company’s suppliers vendors and distribution and logistics providers to experience financial difficulties and result in volatility in paper and other input 

costs these supply chain effects may have an adverse effect on the company’s ability to meet consumer demand and could result in an increase in its costs of production and distribution 

• efforts to address and mitigate the adverse impacts of covid19 may not be successful and may result in the incurrence of costs andor negatively impact the company’s revenues  the company is devoting substantial time and resources to addressing and mitigating the effect of covid19 these efforts including operational changes measures to reduce variable costs and the implementation of costsavings initiatives across its businesses may divert resources and the attention of the company’s senior management from other aspects of the company’s operations including previously planned initiatives operational changes and cost containment measures such as workforce reductions and the shift to digitalonly editions for certain local australian newspapers have caused and may continue to cause the company to incur restructuring and other costs while business support measures including relist and reupgrade offers for new listings and price concessions at the digital real estate services segment have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect revenues there can be no assurance that any efforts taken by the company to address andor mitigate the impact of covid19 will be successful or substantially offset declines in revenues 

• adverse workforce impacts  the company’s operations may be adversely affected if a substantial number of employees or key personnel become ill or are quarantined as a result of covid19 the company has instituted remote working arrangements for a substantial majority of its employees in order to protect their wellbeing and comply with applicable regulations and guidance however there is no certainty that such measures will mitigate the risks posed by covid19 and an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain the company’s business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks or risks to the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls and adversely affect the company’s productivity and ability to manage its business and perform critical functions 

the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic including the extent of adverse impacts on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on among other things the severity duration spread and any reoccurrence of the pandemic the impact of governmental actions and business and consumer behavior in response to the pandemic the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak and prevent or limit any reoccurrence the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted the evolving and uncertain nature of this situation makes it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of the company’s business including the supply and demand for the company’s products and services its cash flows its advertising revenues the impact on the delivery of programming and associated payments and the collectability of receivables however the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the company’s business and results of operations as described above and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition particularly over the near to medium term any such adverse impact or any continued weakness in economic conditions andor further disruptions in the global financial and capital markets could in turn make it more difficult for certain of the company’s operating subsidiaries to comply with the financial and other covenants relating to their existing indebtedness impact the availability and cost of additional financing lead to significant and adverse exchange rate fluctuations result in additional impairments in the value of the company’s assets and additional valuation allowances on the company’s deferred tax assets or cause further declines in the company’s stock price in addition the covid19 pandemic will amplify many of the other risk factors disclosed elsewhere in this “item 1a risk factors” 

the company operates in a highly competitive business environment and its success depends on its ability to compete effectively 

the company faces significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment including both traditional and new content providers this competition continues to intensify as a result of rapid changes in technologies platforms and business models and the company may be adversely affected if consumers or customers migrate to other alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues at the company’s newspaper businesses may continue to decline reflecting consumers’ increasing reliance on a variety of content providers and platforms including search engines news aggregation websites social media networks and customized news feeds for the delivery of news and information often without charge in addition due to the increased availability of highspeed internet access and developments in content distribution platforms that enable streaming and downloading of programming consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content through an increasing variety of providers these providers include iptv and svod services such as fetch tv netflix stan and amazon prime video streaming services offered through digital media providers such as youtube and facebook as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs disney and the fta networks that provide content including smaller lowercost or free programming packages directly to consumers over the internet the increasing number of choices available to consumers for 

video content many of which provide original or exclusive content has caused some of the subscribers to the company’s paytv services to disconnect their services downgrade to smaller less expensive programming packages or purchase certain services from other providers and this may continue this trend has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect both the company’s subscription revenue and in turn advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company as well as increase subscriber acquisition retention and other costs 

in order to compete effectively the company must differentiate and distinguish its brands and their associated products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer and customer needs tastes and behaviors which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on brand awareness and acceptance of the highquality differentiated content in its newspapers book titles paytv programming and radio stations as well as its wide array of digital products and services in order to retain and grow its audiences consumers and subscribers however consumer tastes change frequently and are difficult to predict and when faced with a multitude of choices consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source quality or reliability online traffic and product purchases are also driven by internet search results referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that are changed frequently by the owner or operator and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the company’s businesses including those affecting how the company’s content apps and products are prioritized displayed and monetized could impede the company’s ability to compete effectively by significantly decreasing traffic to the company’s digital properties lowering advertiser interest in those properties increasing costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lowering product sales and subscriptions or otherwise adversely affecting the company’s business 

the company expects to continue to pursue new strategic initiatives and develop new products and services in order to remain competitive such as its ott strategy and the migration of subscribers from cable to satellite or internet delivery at its paytv business and its referralbased model for its us digital real estate business the company has incurred and may in the future be required to incur significant capital expenditures marketing and other costs in order to implement these strategies and develop these new products and services which may be dilutive to its earnings there can be no assurance these strategic initiatives products and services will be successful in the manner or time period the company expects or that it will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits it expects to achieve the failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition for example the company is targeting a different demographic with its streaming services which are offered at a lower price point than its traditional broadcast subscription packages however if instead those streaming offerings cause broadcast subscribers to disconnect their services or downgrade to smaller less expensive programming packages the company’s revenues may be materially and adversely affected 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources fewer regulatory burdens better competitive positions in certain areas greater operating capabilities greater access to sources of content data technology or other services or strategic relationships andor easier access to financing which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology consumer and customer needs and preferences and market conditions continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the company operates may increase these advantages including through greater scale financial leverage andor access to content data technology and other offerings if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company must respond to evolving technologies and changes in consumer and customer needs and behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products and services in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly and the resulting changes in consumer and customer needs behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company’s products and services less valuable for example enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels have led to alternative methods for the delivery storage and consumption of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices often without charge distribution of video content to televisions computers tablets and mobile and other devices via streaming and downloading and digital distribution models for books these developments have driven consumers to expect more control over the convenience and price of content consumption and may in turn continue to reduce the demand for the company’s newspapers television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay for such products and services consumption of the company’s content on new thirdparty delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates in addition other technological developments such as those allowing consumers to browse incognito or skip fast forward through or block advertisements or otherwise timeshift viewing may cause changes in consumer 

behavior that reduce the company’s ability to serve advertising based on user data and behaviors or at all which would adversely affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers 

technological developments have in many cases also increased competition by significantly lowering barriers to entry for example content providers are now able to compete with the company’s paytv business via directtoconsumer offerings as internet streaming capabilities have enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers and customers are willing to spend on the company’s products and services additional digital distribution channels such as online retailers and digital marketplaces have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s business models including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

the company must continue to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to ensure its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers are delivered in the manner in which consumers and customers wish to consume them and are offered at competitive prices the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer and customer needs and behavior and to attract and retain employees with the necessary skill sets and knowledge base for example the company has made and expects to continue to make investments and incur costs in its paytv business as it continues to develop and improve its ott services including its kayo sports streaming service foxtel now and its recentlylaunched binge entertainment streaming service the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process and there is a risk the company may not be able to develop and market these opportunities in a timely or costeffective manner and its responses and strategies to remain competitive including new product and service offerings may not be accepted by consumers and customers generate sufficient revenues to be profitable or be as profitable as existing product and service offerings the company’s failure to respond to and develop new technologies distribution channels and platforms products and services to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer and customer needs and preferences could cause its customer audience andor user base or its advertisers to decline in some cases precipitously and could have a significant adverse effect on its business asset values results of operations and financial condition 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers digital media properties cable channels and other paytv programming and radio stations the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors including 1 demand for the company’s products and services 2 audience fragmentation 3 digital advertising trends 4 its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers 5 general economic and business conditions 6 demographics of the customer base 7 advertising rates 8 advertising effectiveness and 9 maintaining its brand strength and reputation 

demand for the company’s products and services depends upon the company’s ability to differentiate those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behaviors and is evaluated based on a variety of metrics for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits number of users and user engagement any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand particularly demand generated through new platforms may lead to undermeasurement and in turn lower advertising pricing and spending 

the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content and the ability of digital advertising offerings to deliver targeted advertising promptly has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms large digital platforms in particular such as facebook google and amazon which have extensive audience reach audience data and targeting capabilities have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market in recent years and the company expects this trend to continue the shift to digital media has significantly impacted the company’s print advertising revenues which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are also increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising in 

addition in the past rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising as a result increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues digital advertising networks and exchanges realtime bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale play a significant role in the advertising marketplace and have caused and may continue to cause further downward pricing pressure new thirdparty delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers the company’s digital advertising operations also rely on a small number of significant technologies such as google’s ad manager which if interrupted or meaningfully changed or if the providers leverage their power to alter the economic structure could adversely impact advertising revenues in addition evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising as well as the development and implementation of technology and policies that adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of its advertising including blocking changing the location of or obscuring the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices browsing incognito blocking or deleting cookies andor the phaseout of browser support for third party cookies may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage and grow digital audiences collect and leverage better user data develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content and video and mobile advertising and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings 

the company’s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions including consumer spending housing sales auto sales unemployment rates and job creation advertisers’ budgeting and buying patterns which tend to be cyclical as well as federal state and local election and other news cycles natural disasters epidemics pandemics including covid19 and other widespread health crises or acts of terrorism have led and could continue to lead to greater economic uncertainty and reduced spending by advertisers in addition certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company’s advertising revenues including retail technology and finance some of these sectors such as retail are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from business curtailments and closures and other measures implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic as well as increased online competition a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer reduced demand for the company’s offerings a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets results of operations and financial condition 

the inability to obtain and retain sports entertainment and other programming rights and content could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company’s operating businesses and costs could also increase upon renewal 

competition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense and the success of certain of the company’s operating businesses including its paytv business depends on among other things their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof such as music rights that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices the paytv industry including the company’s paytv business has experienced higher programming costs due to among other things 1 increases imposed by sports entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts 2 the carriage of incremental programming including new services and svod programming and 3 increased competition from other digital media companies including svod providers for the rights to popular or exclusive content certain of the company’s operating businesses including its paytv business are party to contracts for sports entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties including professional sports leagues and teams television and motion picture producers and other content providers these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms and as they expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought in the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire the financial and other terms of these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the company’s control such as changes in the company’s bargaining power or in the industry and in order to retain or extend such rights the company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs furthermore third parties may 

outbid the company for those rights andor for any new programming offerings in addition as other content providers develop their own competing services they may be unwilling to provide the company with access to certain content for example professional sports leagues or teams as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs and disney have created and may continue to create their own directtoconsumer offerings further consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the company the loss of rights may adversely affect the breadth or quality of the company’s content offerings including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or in some cases loss of customers or audiences which could in turn adversely affect its revenues in addition the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates the longterm nature of some of the company’s content commitments may also limit its flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in business and economic conditions including covid19 and the market segments in which it operates 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies are experiencing economic and market weakness and uncertainty as a result of the ongoing covid19 pandemic as well as trade disputes between a number of countries these conditions have resulted in among other things a tightening of and in some cases more limited access to the credit and capital markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a decline in the real estate market such weakness and uncertainty and associated market disruptions have often led to broader prolonged economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures lower demand for the company’s products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity any continued or recurring economic weakness is likely to have a similar impact on the company’s business and reduce its circulation and subscription advertising real estate consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 39 of its fiscal 2020 revenues from australia as a result the company’s business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market including for example weakness in the australian residential real estate market which has led and may continue to lead to lower listing volumes at rea group the company also generated approximately 13 of its fiscal 2020 revenues from the uk which continues to experience political regulatory economic and market uncertainty following its exit from the european union in january 2020 commonly referred to as “brexit” the uk is now in a transition period until december 31 2020 during which the eu and the uk will negotiate future arrangements regarding trade finance and other key matters while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict it could significantly affect the fiscal monetary political and regulatory landscape lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union result in the diminishment or elimination of barrierfree access between the uk and other european union member states and additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company’s businesses in the uk and elsewhere 

in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms although the company believes that its cash on hand operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for at least the next 12 months there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions investments and divestitures that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees customers and suppliers 4 with respect to investments risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business 5 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 6 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 7 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 8 in the case of foreign acquisitions 

and investments the impact of specific economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries 9 liabilities both known and unknown associated with the acquired businesses or investments 10 in some cases increased regulation and 11 in some cases lower liquidity as a result of the use of cash or incurrence of debt to fund such acquisition or investment if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing businesses the company’s business results of operations financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected and the company may be required to record noncash impairment charges for the writedown of certain acquired assets 

the company has also divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition these include among others the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms disruption to its business andor diversion of management attention from other business concerns loss of key employees difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business and retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt as of june 30 2020 the foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 350 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the company’s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable however there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company’s reporting currency primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for inclusion in the company’s consolidated financial statements which could in turn have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets the economic volatility and uncertainty caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic has led to significant and adverse exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and both the australian dollar and the british pound sterling in recent periods in addition exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to continued economic and political uncertainty in the uk as a result of its failure to secure agreements with the european union regarding trade finance and other key matters prior to brexit 

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss improper access to or disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs loss of revenue reputational damage or other harm to the company’s business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s network management are important to its business activities and contain the company’s proprietary confidential and sensitive business information including personal data of its customers and personnel the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and “cloudbased” systems and services that support a variety of business operations network and information systemsrelated events affecting the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies such as computer compromises cyber threats and attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities by individuals or statesponsored or other groups or any combination of the foregoing as well as power and internet outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities war human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems could result in disruption of the company’s business andor loss corruption improper access to or disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the company’s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the company’s systems facilities or data or those of third parties with whom the company does business in addition any design or manufacturing defects in or the improper implementation of hardware or 

software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly disrupt the company’s network and information systems or compromise information security 

in recent years there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks have become more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against activities of this nature may also increase during times of instability including during the covid19 pandemic as online activity increases andor operational changes such as remote working are implemented in response as a result the risks associated with such an event continue to increase particularly as the company’s digital businesses expand the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date individually or in the aggregate however there is no assurance that there will not be a cybersecurity threat or incident that has a material adverse effect in the future while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data business information including intellectual property and other confidential information to prevent data loss or corruption and to prevent or detect security breaches such measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently additionally it may be difficult to detect and defend against certain threats and vulnerabilities that can persist over extended periods of time any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the company’s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies could result in a disruption of its operations including degradation or disruption of service equipment damage customer audience or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations and enforcement actions lawsuits remediation costs a loss of customers audience advertisers business partners or revenues and other financial losses if any such failure compromise breach interruption or similar event results in improper access to or disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal and credit card data as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy as well as private individual or class action lawsuits the company may also be required to notify certain governmental agencies andor regulators including the appropriate eu supervisory authority about any actual or perceived data security breach as well as the individuals who are affected by any such incident within strict time periods in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities in the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact the company’s brand and reputation and materially affect its business results of operations and financial condition 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of adverse developments in the company’s industry and challenging market conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic the company has recognized and may in the future recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill intangible assets investments and other longlived assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s results of operations and in the case of cash restructuring charges its financial condition impairments and restructuring charges may also negatively impact the company’s taxes including its ability to deduct certain interest costs the company’s management must regularly evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company’s cash flows in order to determine whether based on projected discounted future cash flows and other market assumptions the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including newspaper mastheads publishing imprints radio broadcast licenses trademarks and trade names publishing rights and customer relationships during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the business environment credit and capital markets or the economy generally including as a result of the covid19 pandemic and actual or projected operating results require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions for example the adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic or any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue or subscribers the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights andor consumer acceptance of new products including the company’s new svod services could lead to a downward revision in the 

fair value of certain reporting units any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or other longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required and any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations for example in fiscal 2020 the company recognized noncash impairment charges of 1690 million primarily due to a 931 million writedown of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets at its foxtel reporting unit as a result of lower expected broadcast subscribers and the expected negative impact of covid19 on advertising ott and commercial subscriber revenues in the near term 410 million of writedowns related to news america marketing including 175 million related to the reclassification to assets held for sale and 292 million in impairments of property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets identified during the companys annual impairment assessment in addition as of june 30 2020 the company had approximately 908 million of goodwill that is at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the corresponding reporting units equaled their respective carrying values the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it and the leverage of its foxtel operating subsidiaries could limit the ability of those subsidiaries to access the credit and capital markets and have other adverse effects 

from time to time the company expects to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing or refinance existing indebtedness although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place including the company’s revolving credit facility will permit the company to finance its operations for at least the next 12 months on acceptable terms and conditions the company’s access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including the ongoing covid19 pandemic the company’s foxtel operating subsidiaries have outstanding indebtedness that could limit or prevent them from incurring additional debt or refinancing or otherwise extending the maturities of their existing debt and reduce their flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions including those arising from the pandemic as of june 30 2020 the foxtel operating subsidiaries’ total outstanding indebtedness was 965 million excluding related party debt with maturities ranging from fiscal 2023 through fiscal 2025 factors impacting the company’s ability to access the credit and capital markets include but are not limited to the following a number of which have been adversely impacted by the ongoing covid19 pandemic as disclosed elsewhere in this “item 1a risk factors” 1 the financial and operational performance of the company andor its operating subsidiaries as applicable 2 the company’s credit ratings andor the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries as applicable 3 the provisions of any relevant debt instruments credit agreements indentures and similar or associated documents collectively the “debt documents” 4 the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets and 5 the state of the economy there can be no assurance that the company will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

the company’s consolidated debt could also have other adverse effects a portion of the outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates which exposes the company to the risk of interest rate fluctuations if interest rates increase the applicable debt service obligations will increase which could reduce available cash flow and make it more difficult to make scheduled debt payments andor limit the amount of cash available for operations including investments and capital expenditures although the company hedges a portion of the exposure to these interest rate movements there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements in addition the foxtel operating subsidiaries’ outstanding debt documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility subject to certain exceptions these covenants restrict or prohibit these operating subsidiaries from among other things undertaking certain transactions disposing of certain properties or assets including subsidiary stock merging or consolidating with any other person making financial accommodation available giving guarantees entering into certain other financing arrangements creating or permitting certain liens engaging in transactions with affiliates making repayments of certain other loans and undergoing fundamental business changes 

these instruments also generally include financial covenants requiring the foxtel operating subsidiaries to maintain specified net debt to ebitda and net interest coverage ratios in the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any of the foxtel operating subsidiaries’ debt documents the lenders or noteholders as applicable may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable debt documents which could result in a default under other outstanding debt documents and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operation and financial condition 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and 

changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests in addition laws and regulations vary between local state federal and international jurisdictions and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply 

the company’s australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy regulation or legislation or the application or enforcement thereof applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general this includes 

• antisiphoning legislation which currently prevents paytv providers such as foxtel from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless 

– national or commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event 

– the rights are held by commercial television licensees whose television broadcasting services cover more than 50 of the australian population or 

– the rights are held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters 

• other parts of the broadcasting services act that regulate ownership interests and control of australian media organizations such legislation may have an impact on the company’s ownership structure and operations and may restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities and 

• the telecommunications act and associated codes which apply various consumer protection regimes to foxtel as a telecommunications service provider 

the company’s business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which have implications for how such data is managed many of these laws and regulations are increasingly complex and continue to evolve and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application moreover data privacy and security laws may potentially conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with these laws and regulations could be costly and resourceintensive require the company to change its business practices or limit or restrict aspects of the company’s business in a manner adverse to its business operations including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted datadriven advertising offerings the company’s failure to comply even if inadvertent or in good faith or as a result of a compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems by a third party could result in exposure to enforcement by us federal state or local or foreign governments or private parties as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage examples of such laws include the european union’s gdpr and the uk dpa each of which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and the uk respectively and significantly increases maximum penalties for noncompliance and california’s ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 and established certain transparency rules and puts greater restrictions on the collection use and sharing of personal information of california residents see “governmental regulation—data privacy and security” for more information finally because some of the company’s products and services are available on the internet it may be subject to laws or regulations exposing it to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence 

in addition the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press following the inquiry the uk government established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body publishers who are not members of an approved regulator including the company may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is commenced the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances the majority of the uk press including news uk has established an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso ipso which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the uk these powers which include the ability to impose fines of up to £1 million for systemic breaches of ipso’s editor’s code of practice may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions 

adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company’s business practices and operating results 

from time to time the company is party to litigation as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies including with respect to antitrust tax data privacy and security intellectual property employment and other matters see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 17 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm andor significant monetary damages injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition as well as the company’s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted in addition regardless of merit or outcome such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors 

the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxation in us federal state and local jurisdictions and various nonus jurisdictions including australia and the uk the company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws regulations practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on among other things the geographic mix of the company’s profits and losses changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company’s deferred tax assets the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances if among other things adverse economic conditions including those caused by covid19 negatively impact the company’s ability to realize its deferred tax assets evaluating and estimating the company’s tax provision current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

the company’s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns or positions taken by the company and as a result taxrelated settlements or litigation may occur resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or its taxes in the future could increase which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition 

the organization for economic cooperation and development continues its program of work to develop a consensus solution in relation to its base erosion and profit shifting action 1 addressing the tax challenges of the digitalization of the economy the outcome of this program may change various aspects of the existing framework under which the company’s tax obligations are determined in countries in which it does business several foreign jurisdictions have separately introduced new digital services taxes on revenue of companies that provide certain digital services while the unilateral digital services taxes in force in countries to date including the uk have had limited impact on the company’s overall tax obligations the company continues to monitor proposals for new digital services taxes in various countries there is limited guidance about the applicability of these new taxes to the company’s businesses and significant uncertainty as to what type of digital services will be deemed in scope if these new taxes are applied to the company’s revenue in these foreign jurisdictions it could have an adverse impact on its business and financial performance 

theft of the company’s content including digital piracy and signal theft may decrease revenue and adversely affect the company’s business and profitability 

the company’s success depends in part on its ability to maintain and monetize the intellectual property rights in its content and theft of its brands programming digital content books and other copyrighted material affects the value of its content developments in technology including the wide availability of higher internet bandwidth and reduced storage costs increase the 

threat of content piracy by making it easier to stream duplicate and widely distribute pirated material including from other lessregulated countries into the company’s primary markets covid19 may increase incentives and opportunities to access content in unauthorized ways if the resulting economic weakness persists andor as consumers spend more time at home the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions both individually and in some instances together with industry associations however these efforts may be costly and are not always successful particularly as infringers continue to develop tools that undermine security features and enable the cloaking of online identities and the company cannot ensure that it will be able to reduce or control theft of its content the proliferation of unauthorized use of the company’s content may have an adverse effect on its business and profitability by reducing the revenue that the company could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content moreover protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed and enforced if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed or not effectively enforced the company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase in addition the failure of legal and technological protections to evolve as piracy and associated technological tools become more sophisticated could make it more difficult for the company to adequately protect its intellectual property which could in turn negatively impact its value and further increase the company’s enforcement costs 

the company’s paytv business depends on a single or limited number of suppliers for certain key products and services and any reduction or interruption in the supply of these products and services or a significant increase in price could have an adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition

the company’s paytv business uses satellite systems to transmit its programming to its subscribers andor authorized sublicensees the company’s distribution facilities include uplinks communications satellites and downlinks and the company also uses studio and transmitter facilities transmissions may be disrupted or degraded as a result of local disasters including extreme weather power outages terrorist attacks cyberattacks or other similar events that damage or destroy onground uplinks or downlinks or studio and transmitter facilities or as a result of damage to a satellite satellites are subject to significant operational and environmental risks while in orbit including anomalies resulting from various factors such as manufacturing defects and problems with power or control systems as well as environmental hazards such as meteoroid events electrostatic storms and collisions with space debris these events may result in the loss of one or more transponders on a satellite or the entire satellite andor reduce the useful life of the satellite which could in turn lead to a disruption or loss of video services to the company’s customers the company does not carry commercial insurance for business disruptions or losses resulting from the foregoing events as it believes the cost of insurance premiums is uneconomical relative to the risk instead the company seeks to mitigate this risk through the maintenance of backup satellite capacity and other contingency plans however these steps may not be sufficient and if the company is unable to secure alternate distribution studio andor transmission facilities in a timely manner any such disruption or loss could have an adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

the company is subject to payment processing risk which could lead to adverse effects on the company’s business and results of operations 

the company’s customers pay for its products and services using a variety of different payment methods including credit and debit cards prepaid cards direct debit online wallets and through direct carrier and partner billing the company relies on internal systems as well as those of third parties to process payment acceptance and processing of these payment methods are subject to certain rules and regulations and require payment of interchange and other fees to the extent there are increases in payment processing fees material changes in the payment ecosystem delays in receiving payments from payment processors any failures to comply with or changes to rules or regulations concerning payments loss of payment or billing partners andor disruptions or failures in or fraudulent use of or access to payment processing systems or payment products the company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted and it could suffer reputational harm furthermore if the company is unable to maintain its fraud and chargeback rates at acceptable levels card networks may impose fines and its card approval rate may be impacted the termination of the company’s ability to process payments on any major payment method would adversely affect its business and results of operations 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

in a variety of the company’s businesses it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins 

the market price of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the 

company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or the addition or loss of significant customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates 12 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 13 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders 14 overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions and 15 changes in the amounts and frequency of dividends or share repurchases if any the ongoing covid19 pandemic has amplified many of the foregoing factors and resulted in additional volatility in the company’s stock price 

certain fcc rules and regulations and the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the us 

the federal communications commission “fcc” has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the common ownership of radio and television broadcast stations and the common ownership of broadcast stations and newspapers the “broadcast ownership rules” and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest the “program access rules” in november 2017 the fcc voted to eliminate the broadcast ownership rules and the order became effective in february 2018 however in september 2019 a panel of the us court of appeals for the third circuit the “third circuit” issued an order vacating the fcc’s order and reinstating the broadcast ownership rules the fcc’s petition for en banc review was denied in november 2019 following which a mandate reinstating the broadcast ownership rules was issued the fcc and certain other parties filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the us supreme court appealing the third circuit’s decision in april 2020 and are awaiting a ruling 

under the fcc’s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above the murdoch family trust’s ownership interest in both the company and fox would generally result in each company’s businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules consequently the company may be restricted from taking advantage of certain acquisition or investment opportunities including for example the acquisition of a newspaper in the same local market in which fox owns or operates a television station in addition the company agreed in the separation and distribution agreement as amended that if it acquires newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede fox’s business under the broadcast ownership rules or any other federal statute or fcc rule that limits directly or indirectly the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations television broadcast stations newspapers andor television broadcast networks including fox’s ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with such rules or statutes then the company will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules or statutes the company also agreed not to acquire an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor including a cable television operator if such acquisition would subject fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules or any other federal statute or fcc rule that limits directly or indirectly the ownership or control of radio broadcast stations television broadcast stations newspapers andor television broadcast networks and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede fox’s business 

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in fox corporation “fox” andor because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of fox which may result in the diversion of certain corporate opportunities to fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and cochairman of fox and lachlan k murdoch who serves as the company’s cochairman and chairman and chief executive officer of fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and fox may agree to implement the company and fox agreed that 

officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s amended and restated bylaws acknowledge that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s amended and restated bylaws further provide that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s amended and restated bylaws to fox instead of the company this could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to fox instead of the company 

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws and delaware law the company’s third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

• a dual class common equity capital structure 

• a prohibition on stockholders taking any action by written consent without a meeting 

• special stockholders’ meeting to be called only by the chief executive officer the board of directors or the holders of not less than 20 of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock 

• the requirement that stockholders give the company advance notice to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to make stockholder proposals at a stockholders’ meeting 

• the requirement of an affirmative vote of at least 65 of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock to amend or repeal its bylaws 

• vacancies on the board of directors to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office 

• certain restrictions on the transfer of the company’s shares and 

• the board of directors to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock and series common stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine 

these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 june 2015 and again in june 2018 pursuant to the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2021 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of 

august 3 2020 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 3 2020 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 3 2020 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

covid19 impact 

covid19 is believed to have been first identified in china in late 2019 and has spread globally the rapid spread has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus including quarantines shelterinplace and other social distancing orders event cancellations travel restrictions school shutdowns and orders for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations the impact of covid19 and measures to prevent its spread have created significant economic volatility uncertainty and disruption and have affected and are continuing to affect the company’s businesses in a number of ways these impacts began to materialize toward the end of the third fiscal quarter continued into the fourth fiscal quarter and had a material impact on the company’s results of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 while the company expects the impacts to continue into fiscal 2021 the rate and magnitude are expected to slow to the extent containment measures in its primary operating geographies become more relaxed over time however recent spikes in infections in a number of jurisdictions have caused governments to reassess the easing of social distancing measures and business curtailments and closures and may cause governmental agencies to impose previous restrictions which could in turn delay expected improvements in the economy and the company’s business as of the date of this filing the company has observed the following effects on its businesses 

digital real estate services  the real estate markets in australia asia and the us have been and may continue to be negatively impacted as a result of social distancing measures business closures and economic uncertainty resulting from covid19 weakness in new listing volumes lower transaction volume and other adverse effects as well as measures the company has taken to support its customers including relist and reupgrade offers for new listings and price concessions have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect revenues although residential real estate activity has increased in recent months including higher listing volumes in australia and improved lead volume in the us real estate markets are expected to remain volatile while covid19 is ongoing particularly as governments in australia and the us have reimposed various restrictions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 the company continued to see strong user traffic at its primary online properties 

subscription video services  the cancellation or postponement of sports events for which the company has broadcast rights resulted in fewer subscribers to its sports services beginning in march 2020 including kayo which in turn has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect subscription revenue from broadcast and kayo subscribers and together with adverse economic conditions have negatively impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact advertising revenue however the company began to see subscribers return to its sports services during the fourth quarter as a number of live sports resumed across australia including a significant increase in kayo subscribers the company has resumed recognizing programming amortization expense for those events that have restarted and expects to recognize approximately 55 million of additional sports programming rights costs in fiscal 2021 that were deferred from fiscal 2020 profitability in future periods may be adversely impacted if the company does not generate sufficient incremental subscription and advertising revenues to offset these costs and compensate for prior losses in addition the closures of pubs and clubs and lower occupancy at hotels throughout australia have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact commercial subscription revenues however 

the company has seen the gradual recovery of commercial subscribers which remains dependent on the easing of government restrictions and social distancing measures 

as a result of the cancellation or postponement of sports events the company renegotiated its existing agreements with certain affected sports leagues to reflect the modified scheduling of sports events and cost concessions and expects to save an estimated a180 million in sports programming costs over the next three fiscal years as a result while a number of sports have resumed play any future postponement of sports events for which the company has broadcast rights will cause a deferral of the recognition of the associated programming amortization expense for the period in which no live games are being played

book publishing  sales have been adversely affected by shipping restrictions and delays imposed by online retailers as well as closures of and operational restrictions on brickandmortar retail stores the impact of such restrictions has diminished in recent months as governmental restrictions and shelter in place orders have been gradually reduced the company has also seen an increase in sales of digital formats of its titles which remain readily available from online retailers

the company has taken various steps to mitigate the impact of covid19 including reducing variable costs and implementing costsavings initiatives across its businesses such as significant reductions andor deferrals in discretionary spending nonessential capital expenditures and headcount and permanently transitioning certain newspaper operations to digitalonly the company expects to benefit from these costsavings initiatives in future periods including an estimated 100 million of cost reductions at foxtel in fiscal 2021 net of the 55 million increase in sports rights costs described above the company is also implementing a shared services program to centralize a number of its functional areas while it is still evaluating the cost savings opportunity from this program and the upfront investment required the company expects to recognize annualized cost savings of at least 100 million beginning in fiscal 2022 

the ultimate impact of covid19 including the extent of adverse impacts on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on among other things the severity duration spread and any reoccurrence of covid19 the impact of governmental actions and business and consumer behavior in response to covid19 the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak and prevent or limit any reoccurrence the resulting global economic conditions and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted the evolving and uncertain nature of this situation makes it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of the company’s businesses including the supply and demand for the company’s products and services its cash flows its advertising revenues the impact on the delivery of programming and associated payments and the collectability of receivables for additional information regarding risks related to covid19 please see “ the ongoing novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic and other similar epidemics pandemics or widespread health crises could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations cash flows and financial position ” in part i item 1a of this form 10k

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2019 the company recorded income tax expense of 126 million on pretax income of 354 million resulting in an effective tax rate that was higher than the us statutory tax rate the higher tax rate was primarily due to lower tax benefits on impairments valuation allowances being recorded against tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions with operating losses and the impact from foreign operations which are subject to higher tax rates 

management assesses available evidence to determine whether sufficient future taxable income will be generated to permit the use of existing deferred tax assets based on management’s assessment of available evidence it has been determined that it is more likely than not that certain deferred tax assets in us federal state and foreign jurisdictions may not be realized and therefore a valuation allowance has been established against those tax assets

in response to covid19 many governments have enacted measures to provide aid and economic stimulus to companies these measures include deferring the due dates of tax payments favorable changes in estimated payment calculations or other changes to their income and nonincomebased tax laws the “covid19 measures” on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the “cares act” was enacted in the us in response to covid19 the cares act contains several income tax provisions such as relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and the use of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 there were no material impacts to the company’s income tax provision as it relates to covid19 measures the company continues to monitor developments in relation to covid19 measures and their applicability to its business in the jurisdictions where it operates 

net loss income —net loss was 1545 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 a decline of 1773 million as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily driven by the increase in noncash impairment and restructuring charges discussed above 

net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests —net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests was 276 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 a decline of 349 million as compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to the impact of the noncash impairment charges recognized at the company’s foxtel reporting unit

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation 

free cash flow available to news corporation is a nongaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures “free cash flow” less rea group free cash flow plus cash dividends received from rea group free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow 

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions dividend payouts and repurchasing stock the company believes excluding rea group’s free cash flow and including dividends received from rea group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group’s cash balance the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group which has generally been lower than the company’s unadjusted free cash flow 

a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period

commitments 

the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements “firm commitments” to make future payments these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations 

the following table summarizes the company’s material firm commitments as of june 30 2020 



 

a the company has commitments under purchase obligations related to minimum subscriber guarantees for license fees printing contracts capital projects marketing agreements production services and other legally binding commitments 

b the company has sports programming rights commitments with the national rugby league australian football league cricket australia domestic football league and australian rugby union as well as certain other broadcast rights which are payable through fiscal 2028 during june 2020 the company amended and extended its sports programming rights agreement with the national rugby league to license certain media rights through fiscal 2028 for approximately a15 billion 

c the company has programming rights commitments with various suppliers for programming content 

d the company leases office facilities warehouse facilities printing plants satellite services and equipment these leases which are classified as operating leases are expected to be paid at certain dates through fiscal 2048 this amount includes approximately 13 million of office facilities that have been subleased from fox corporation amounts reflected represent only the company’s lease obligations for which it has firm commitments 

e the company has contractual commitments for satellite transmission services the company’s satellite transponder services arrangements extend through fiscal 2032 and are accounted for as operating or finance leases based on the underlying terms of those arrangements 

f see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

g reflects the company’s expected future interest payments on borrowings outstanding and interest rates applicable at june 30 2020 such rates are subject to change in future periods see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

the table also excludes the company’s pension obligations other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 30 million and 16 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 22 million in fiscal 2021 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2020 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 9 million in fiscal 2021 see note 18—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

contingencies 

the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations including those discussed in note 17—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters fees expenses fines penalties judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable see note 17—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid however these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress or as settlements or litigations occur 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results of operations and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

the company’s longlived assets include goodwill finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

under asc 350 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill 

for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates longterm growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

the performance of the company’s annual impairment analysis in fiscal 2020 resulted in 89 million of impairments to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets within the news media segment the fair values of the company’s reporting units in fiscal 2020 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 00 to 530 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 90 to 225 longterm growth rates ranging from 00 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 02560 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 50100 significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

as of june 30 2020 the subscription video services and news media segments had reporting units with goodwill of approximately 908 million that is atrisk for future impairment of which 807 million relates to the subscription video services segment and 101 million relates to the news media segment after the writedown of goodwill resulting from the fiscal 2020 annual and interim impairment tests the fair values of these reporting units with goodwill at risk equaled their respective carrying values significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method for atrisk reporting units were discount rates ranging from 105 to 130 and longterm growth rates ranging from 00 to 25 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method for atrisk reporting units were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and a control premium of 50 to 100 any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in further impairment in certain reporting units of the subscription video services and news media segments the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results as a result of the long range planning process and the short term impact of covid19 the company recorded noncash impairment charges to its property plant and equipment of 148 million and 55 million at its uk newspapers and australian newspapers reporting units respectively in fiscal 2020 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method for news uk were a discount rate of 95 and a longterm growth rate of 10 and for news corp australia were a discount rate of 115 and a 00 long term growth rate refer to note 7—property plant and equipment 

programming costs 

costs incurred in acquiring program rights are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program the pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors if initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership an accelerated method of amortization is used the company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be recognized prospectively the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect net realizable value changes in circumstances may result in a writedown of the asset to fair value the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired for sports contracts with dedicated channels the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months 

while the company has concluded discussions with various sports leagues regarding the scheduling of sports events and cost concessions and a number of sports have resumed play any future postponement of sports events for which the company has broadcast rights will cause a deferral of the recognition of the associated programming amortization expense for the period in which no live games are being played 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax expense benefit 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 18—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the weighted average expected longterm rate of return of 37 for fiscal 2021 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 20 equities 71 fixedincome securities and 9 cash and other investments 

the company recorded 7 million and 2 million in net periodic benefit costs income in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 respectively the company utilizes the full yieldcurve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 20 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2021 net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2020 and 2019 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 



the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 37 for fiscal 2021 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2020 were approximately 529 million which increased from approximately 484 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2019 this increase of 45 million was primarily due to decreased discount rates lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and have a minimal impact on benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans 

the company made contributions of 30 million and 16 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2020 and 2019 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2020 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 22 million in fiscal 2021 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 19—other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 



recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates interest rates stock prices and credit 

when deemed appropriate the company uses derivative financial instruments such as crosscurrency interest rate swaps interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures the primary market risks managed by the company through the use of derivative instruments include 

• foreign currency exchange rate risk arising primarily through foxtel debt group borrowings denominated in us dollars payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights and 

• interest rate risk arising from fixed and floating rate foxtel debt group borrowings the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk interest rate risk and other relevant market risks the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2020 and 2019 



based on the fiscal year ended june 30 2020 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 53 million and 11 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 10 million and 1 million respectively on an annual basis 

derivatives and hedging 

as a result of the transaction the company consolidated foxtel’s portfolio of debt and derivative instruments as of june 30 2020 the foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 350 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars foxtel utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the total notional value of these crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were approximately a280 million and a70 million respectively as of june 30 2020 foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to us dollar payments for customer premise equipment and certain programming rights the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was 53 million as of june 30 2020 

some of the derivative instruments in place may create volatility during the fiscal year as they are markedtomarket according to accounting rules and may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impact on the underlying transactions are realized 

the table below provides further details of the sensitivity of the company’s derivative financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk as of june 30 2020 in millions 



any resulting changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions primarily us dollar denominated liabilities impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates the ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle 

interest rate risk 

the company’s current financing arrangements and facilities include 594 million of outstanding fixedrate debt and 547 million of outstanding variablerate bank facilities before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements fixed and variablerate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates a change in the market interest rate or yield of fixedrate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt while a change in the market interest rate of variablerate debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt in connection with these borrowings foxtel has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap us dollar denominated fixed rate interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate payments as discussed above foxtel utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to swap australian dollar denominated variable interest rate payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rate payments as of june 30 2020 the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately a300 million refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility upon adoption of asu 201601 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 any changes in fair value of the company’s common stock 

investments are recognized in the statement of operations these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 54 million as of june 30 2020 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in income of approximately 5 million before tax 

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2020 or june 30 2019 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2020 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union and australia for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive directive 9546ec fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25 2018 the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection processing use and security of personal data contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthens the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continues to restrict the transborder flow of such data requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification significantly increases maximum penalties for noncompliance up to 20 million euros or approximately 23 million us dollars or 4 of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year whichever is higher and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication eprivacy directive with a regulation to among other things amend the current directive’s rules on the use of cookies and optouts 

in 2016 the european commission adopted a new mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield other than for one business unit operating an advertising exchange the company has not certified to and does not rely on the privacy shield framework for data transfers among the company’s businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms however certain of the company’s service providers do rely on the privacy shield the privacy shield is subject to significant uncertainty including an annual review procedure by us and eu authorities and a legal challenge scheduled to be heard by the general court of the eu in july 2019 that could affect the company’s or its service providers’ obligations thereunder the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data including the european union 

 

standard contractual clauses are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted could cause the company to incur additional costs require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services 

in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain in flux and evolving in the united states and internationally the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press a press recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established once approved by the press recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers in addition to the press recognition panel certain legislation provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances 

press regulator impress was recognized as an approved regulator by the press recognition panel on october 25 2016 however publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso in september 2014 ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code of practice and levy fines of up to £1 million ipso has also introduced an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members including the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance 

uk radio broadcasting regulation 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit the threat of piracy by preventing unauthorized access to its content through the use of programming content encryption signal encryption and other security access devices and digital rights management software as well as by obtaining site blocking orders against pirate streaming and torrent sites and a variety of other actions the company also seeks to limit such threat by pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws however effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company also engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock 

the company’s businesses operate in a highly competitive business environment and the company’s success depends on its ability to compete effectively 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment including both traditional and new content providers this competition continues to intensify as a result of rapid changes in technologies and platforms and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting consumers’ increasing reliance on a variety of content providers and platforms including search engines news aggregation websites social media networks and customized news feeds for the delivery of news and information often without charge in addition due to the increased availability of highspeed internet access and innovations in content distribution platforms that enable streaming and downloading of programming consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content through an increasing variety of providers these providers include iptv and svod services such as fetch tv netflix stan and amazon prime video streaming services offered through digital media providers such as youtube and facebook as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs disney and the fta networks that have begun providing content including smaller lowercost or free programming packages directly to consumers over the internet the increasing number of choices available to consumers for video content has caused some of the subscribers to the company’s paytv services to disconnect their services downgrade to smaller less expensive programming packages or purchase certain services from other providers and this may continue this trend has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect both the company’s subscription revenue and in turn advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company 

in order to compete effectively the company must differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on acceptance of the highquality differentiated content in its newspapers book titles paytv programming and radio stations as well as its wide array of digital and mobile products and services in order to retain and grow its audiences consumers and subscribers however when faced with a multitude of choices consumers may place greater value on the convenience and price of content and other products and services than they do on their source quality or reliability online traffic and product purchases are also driven by internet search results referrals from social media and other platforms and visibility on digital marketplace platforms and in mobile app stores search engine results and digital marketplace and mobile app store rankings are based on algorithms that change frequently and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the company’s businesses including those affecting how the company’s content apps and products are prioritized displayed and monetized could result in significant decreases in traffic to the company’s digital properties lower advertiser interest in those properties increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic and lower product sales and subscriptions or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business 

from time to time the company may pursue new strategic initiatives in order to remain competitive such as its ott strategy and its planned migration of subscribers from cable to satellite or internet delivery at its paytv business and its new concierge model for its us digital real estate business the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures marketing and other costs in order to implement these strategies which may be dilutive to its earnings there can be no assurance these initiatives will be successful in the manner or 

 

time period the company expects or that it will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits it expects such strategy to achieve the failure to realize those benefits could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition for example the company is targeting a different demographic with its new streaming services which are offered at a lower price point than its traditional broadcast subscription packages however if instead those streaming offerings cause broadcast subscribers to disconnect their services or downgrade to smaller less expensive programming packages the company’s revenues may be materially and adversely affected 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources fewer regulatory burdens better competitive positions in certain areas greater operating capabilities greater access to sources of content or other services andor easier access to financing which may allow them to respond more effectively to changes in technology consumer preferences and market conditions continued consolidation among competitors in certain industries in which the company’s businesses operate may increase these advantages including through greater scale financial leverage andor access to content and other offerings if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company’s products and services less valuable for example alternative methods for the delivery storage and consumption of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices often without charge internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading and digital distribution models for books have empowered consumers to seek more control over the convenience and price of content consumption enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the company’s newspapers television programs and other products and services and the price consumers are willing to pay for such products and services consumption of the company’s content on new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control loss of a direct relationship with consumers and lower engagement and subscription rates in addition other technological developments such as those allowing consumers to skip fast forward through or block advertisements or otherwise timeshift viewing may cause changes in consumer behavior that adversely affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers 

technological developments have in many cases also increased competition by significantly lowering barriers to entry for example content providers are now able to compete with our paytv business via directtoconsumer offerings as internet streaming capabilities enabled the disaggregation of content delivery from the ownership of network infrastructure other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content additional digital distribution channels such as online retailers and digital marketplaces have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s business models including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

the company must continue to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to ensure its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers are delivered in the manner in which consumers and customers wish to consume them and are offered at competitive prices the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior and to attract 

 

and retain employees with the necessary skill sets and knowledge base for example the company has made and expects to continue to makes investments and incur costs in its paytv business as it continues to develop and improve its ott services including its recentlylaunched kayo sports streaming service foxtel now and other potential new ott services the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process and there is a risk the company may not be able to develop and market these opportunities in a timely or costeffective manner and its responses and strategies to remain competitive including new product offerings may not be accepted by consumers or generate sufficient revenues to be profitable the company’s failure to respond to and develop new technologies distribution channels and platforms products and services to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer audience andor user base or its advertisers to decline in some cases precipitously and could have a significant adverse effect on its business asset values results of operations and financial condition 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers integrated marketing services digital media properties cable channels and other paytv programming and radio stations the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors including 1 demand for the company’s products and services 2 audience fragmentation 3 digital advertising trends 4 its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers 5 general economic and business conditions 6 demographics of the customer base 7 advertising rates and 8 advertising effectiveness 

demand for the company’s products and services depends upon the company’s ability to differentiate those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behaviors and is evaluated based on a variety of metrics for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits number of users and user engagement any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand particularly demand generated through new platforms may lead to undermeasurement and in turn lower advertising pricing and spending 

the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms this shift has significantly impacted the company’s print advertising revenues in particular which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years the development of new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising in addition in the past rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising as a result increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues digital advertising networks and exchanges realtime bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers in addition evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising as well as the development and implementation of technology and policies that adversely affect the company’s ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness 

 

of its advertising such as blocking changing the location of or obscuring the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices andor blocking or deleting cookies may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage and grow digital audiences collect and leverage better user data develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content and video and mobile advertising and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings in recent years large digital platforms such as facebook google and amazon which have extensive audience reach and targeting capabilities have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market and the company expects this trend may continue 

the company’s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions including consumer spending housing sales auto sales unemployment rates and job creation advertisers’ budgeting and buying patterns which tend to be cyclical as well as federal state and local election cycles in addition certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company’s advertising revenues including retail technology and finance some of these sectors such as retail are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer reduced demand for the company’s offerings a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets results of operations and financial condition 

the inability to obtain and retain sports entertainment and other programming rights and content could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company’s operating businesses and costs could also increase upon renewal 

competition for popular programming licensed from third parties is intense and the success of certain of the company’s operating businesses including its paytv business depends on among other things their ability to obtain and retain rights to desirable programming and certain related elements thereof such as music rights that enable them to deliver content to subscribers and audiences in the manner in which they wish to consume it and at competitive prices the paytv industry including the company’s paytv business has experienced higher programming costs due to among other things 1 increases imposed by sports entertainment and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts 2 the carriage of incremental programming including new services and svod programming and 3 increased competition from other digital media companies including svod providers for the rights to popular or exclusive content certain of the company’s operating businesses including its paytv business are party to contracts for sports entertainment and other programming rights with various third parties including professional sports leagues and teams television and motion picture producers and other content providers these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms and as they expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought in the course of renegotiating these and other agreements as they expire the financial and other terms of these contracts may change as a result of various reasons beyond the company’s control such as changes in the company’s bargaining power or in the industry and in order to retain or extend such rights the company may be required to increase the value of its offer to amounts that substantially exceed the existing contract costs furthermore third parties may outbid the company for those rights andor for any new programming offerings in addition as other content providers develop their own competing services they may be unwilling to provide the company with 

 

access to certain content for example professional sports leagues or teams as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs and disney have created and may continue to create their own directtoconsumer offerings further consolidation among content providers may increase the amount of content that could become unavailable to the company the loss of rights may adversely affect the breadth or quality of the company’s content offerings including the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or in some cases loss of customers or audiences which could in turn adversely affect its revenues in addition the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if upon renewal escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates 

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions investments and divestitures that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 4 with respect to investments risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business 5 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 6 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 7 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 8 in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of specific economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries 9 liabilities both known and unknown associated with the acquired businesses or investments and 10 in some cases increased regulation if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing businesses the company’s business results of operations financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected and the company may be required to record noncash impairment charges for the writedown of certain acquired assets 

in addition the company has divested and may in the future divest certain assets or businesses that no longer fit with its strategic direction or growth targets divestitures involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition these include among others the inability to find potential buyers on favorable terms disruption to its business andor diversion of management attention from other business concerns loss of key employees difficulties in separating the operations of the divested business and possible retention of certain liabilities related to the divested business 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt as of june 30 2019 the foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the company’s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable however there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company’s reporting currency primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the 

 

company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for inclusion in the company’s consolidated financial statements which could in turn have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets in particular exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to continued political uncertainty in the uk and the negotiation of its exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone and continue to experience periods of economic and market weakness or uncertainty including as a result of recent trade disputes between a number of countries these conditions have in the past resulted in among other things a general tightening in the credit and capital markets limited access to the credit and capital markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market such market disruptions have often led to broader economic downturns that have historically resulted in lower advertising expenditures lower demand for the company’s products and services and unfavorable changes in the mix of products and services purchased and have adversely affected the company’s business results of operations financial condition and liquidity any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company’s business and reduce its circulation and subscription advertising real estate consumer and other revenues and otherwise negatively impact the performance of its businesses the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 40 of its fiscal 2019 revenues from australia as a result the company’s business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market including for example recent weakness in the australian residential real estate market which has led and may continue to lead to lower listing volumes at rea group the company also generated approximately 13 of its fiscal 2019 revenues from the uk which continues to experience political regulatory economic and market uncertainty as it negotiates the terms of brexit while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict it could significantly affect the fiscal monetary political and regulatory landscape lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union result in the diminishment or elimination of barrierfree access between the uk and other european union member states and additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company’s businesses in the uk and elsewhere 

in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing or refinance its existing indebtedness these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms although the company believes that its capitalization operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss improper access to or disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs loss of revenue reputational damage or other harm to the company’s business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s network management are important to its business activities and contain the company’s proprietary confidential and

in recent years there has been a significant rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks have become more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against as a result the risks associated with such an event continue to increase particularly as the company’s digital businesses expand the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date individually or in the aggregate while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data business information including intellectual property and other confidential information to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the company’s systems and does not extend to reputational damage or costs incurred to improve or strengthen systems against future incidents

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 june 2015 and again in june 2018 pursuant to the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2021 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 5 2019 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 5 2019 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 5 2019 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation 

free cash flow available to news corporation is a nongaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures “free cash flow” less rea group free cash flow plus cash dividends received from rea group free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for cash flows from operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow 

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions dividend payouts and repurchasing stock the company believes excluding rea group’s free cash flow and including dividends received from rea group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group’s cash balance the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group which has generally been lower than the company’s unadjusted free cash flow 

a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period

       the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

the table also excludes the company’s pension obligations other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to 

 

reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 16 million and 29 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 20 million in fiscal 2020 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 9 million in fiscal 2020 see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

contingencies 

the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations including those discussed in note 16—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters fees expenses fines penalties judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable see note 16—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid however these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress or as settlements or litigations occur 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

the company’s longlived assets include goodwill finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

under asc 350 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using both a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates longterm growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

the performance of the company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in 87 million of impairments to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2019 primarily related to goodwill at a reporting unit within the news and information services segment the fair values of the company’s reporting units in fiscal 2019 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0 to 54 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 90 to 250 longterm growth rates ranging from 00 to 30 and royalty rates ranging from 0560 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 510 significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

as of june 30 2019 the news and information services and subscription video services segments had reporting units with goodwill of approximately 20 billion that is atrisk for future impairment of which 01 billion relates to the news and information services segment and 19 billion relates to the subscription video services segment the fair values of these reporting units with goodwill at risk exceeded their respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0 to 5 significant unobservable inputs 

 

utilized in the income approach valuation method for atrisk reporting units were discount rates ranging from 1025 to 20 and longterm growth rates ranging from 11 to 20 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method for atrisk reporting units were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and a control premium of 10 any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment and the subscription video services segment failing the fiscal 2019 impairment analysis which would have required the company to record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

programming costs 

costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing programming costs are amortized based on the expected pattern of consumption over the license period or expected useful life of each program the pattern of consumption is based primarily on consumer viewership information as well as other factors if initial airings are expected to generate higher viewership an accelerated method of amortization is used the company monitors its programming amortization policy on an ongoing basis and any impact arising from changes to the policy would be recognized prospectively the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect net realizable value changes in circumstances may result in a writedown of the asset to fair value the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired for sports contracts with dedicated channels the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are 

 

complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax expense benefit 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations an expected rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the weighted average expected longterm rate of return of 46 for fiscal 2020 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 23 equities 68 fixedincome securities and 9 cash and other investments 

the company recorded 2 million and 3 million in net periodic benefit income costs in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019 and 2018 respectively the company utilizes the full yieldcurve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans 

although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 27 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2020 net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be 

 

effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2019 and 2018 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 

 

 the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 46 for fiscal 2020 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2019 were approximately 484 million which increased from approximately 442 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2018 this increase of 42 million was primarily due to decreased discount rates lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans 

the company made contributions of 16 million and 29 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 20 million in fiscal 2020 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 18—other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates interest rates stock prices and credit 

when deemed appropriate the company uses derivative financial instruments such as crosscurrency interest rate swaps interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures the primary market risks managed by the company through the use of derivative instruments include 

 

  

 the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk interest rate risk and other relevant market risks the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2019 and 2018 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2019 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 58 million and 12 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 12 million and 1 million respectively on an annual basis 

 

derivatives and hedging 

as a result of the transaction the company consolidated foxtel’s portfolio of debt and derivative instruments as of june 30 2019 the foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had approximately 575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars foxtel utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the total notional value of these crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were approximately a400 million and a100 million respectively as of june 30 2019 foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to us dollar payments for license fees the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was 9 million as of june 30 2019 

in addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting the company also uses certain derivatives not designated as accounting hedges to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk these are referred to as economic hedges the total notional value of these crosscurrency interest rate derivatives classified as economic hedges was 75 million as of june 30 2019 

some of the derivative instruments in place may create volatility during the fiscal year as they are markedtomarket according to accounting rules and may result in revaluation gains or losses in different periods from when the currency impact on the underlying transactions are realized 

the table below provides further details of the sensitivity of the company’s derivative financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange rate risk and interest rate risk as of june 30 2019 in millions 

 

 any resulting changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments may be partially offset by changes in the fair value of certain balance sheet positions primarily us dollar denominated liabilities impacted by the change in the foreign exchange rates the ability to reduce the exposure of currencies on earnings depends on the magnitude of the derivatives compared to the balance sheet positions during each reporting cycle 

interest rate risk 

the company’s current financing arrangements and facilities include approximately 650 million of outstanding fixedrate debt and approximately 800 million of outstanding variablerate bank facilities before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs see note 9 —borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements fixed and variablerate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates a change in the market interest rate or yield of fixedrate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt while a change in the market interest rate of variablerate debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt in connection with these borrowings foxtel has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap us dollar denominated fixed rate interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate payments as discussed above foxtel utilizes crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to 

 

swap australian dollar denominated variable interest rate payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rate payments as of june 30 2019 the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was approximately a700 million refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility upon adoption of asu 201601 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 any changes in fair value of the company’s common stock investments are recognized in the statement of operations these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 74 million as of june 30 2019 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in income of approximately 7 million before tax 

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2019 or june 30 2018 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2019 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

governmental regulation 

general 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on the company’s interests 

australian media regulation 

the company’s subscription television interests are subject to australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry including the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth the “broadcasting services act” and the telecommunications act 1997 cth the “telecommunications act” and associated codes the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority 

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the broadcasting services act subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 26 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50 of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters b other parts of the broadcasting services act that may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities and c various consumer protection regimes under the telecommunications act and associated codes which apply to new foxtel as a telecommunications service provider 

data privacy and security 

the company’s business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us certain of the company’s websites mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent in addition the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements more state and local governments are also expanding enacting or proposing data privacy laws that govern the collection and use of personal data of their residents and increase penalties and afford private rights of action to individuals in certain circumstances for failure to comply and most states have enacted legislation requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union and australia for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive directive 9546ec fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25 2018 the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection processing use and security of personal data contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthens the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continues to restrict the transborder flow of such data requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and 

  

freedoms of individuals requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification significantly increases maximum penalties for noncompliance up to 20 million euros or approximately 23 million us dollars or 4 of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year whichever is higher and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication eprivacy directive with a regulation to among other things amend the current directive’s rules on the use of cookies and optouts 

in 2016 the european commission adopted a new mechanism for the transfer of personal data from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield the company has not certified to and does not rely on the privacy shield framework for data transfers among the company’s businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms however certain of the company’s service providers do rely on the privacy shield the privacy shield is subject to significant uncertainty including an annual review procedure by us and eu authorities that could affect the company’s or its service providers’ obligations thereunder the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data including the european union standard contractual clauses are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted could cause the company to incur additional costs require it to change business practices or affect the manner in which it provides its services 

in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain in flux and evolving in the united states and internationally the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press a press recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies was established once approved by the press recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers in addition to the new press recognition panel legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances 

publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead the independent press standards organisation or ipso ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections 

  

and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code of practice and levy fines of up to £1 million ipso has also introduced a pilot arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications the burdens ipso imposes on its print media members including the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance 

uk radio broadcasting regulation 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions 

intellectual property 

the company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in newspapers books television programming and other content and technologies trademarks in names and logos trade names domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights these licenses include 1 the sports programming rights licenses for the national rugby league australian football league cricket australia football federation australia and australian rugby union described in note 16 to the financial statements 2 licenses from various third parties including arris of patents and other technology for the settop boxes and related operating and conditional access systems used in the company’s paytv business 3 the trademark license from nar for the realtorcom ® trademark and website address as well as the realtor ® trademark the “nar license” and 4 the trademark licenses from twentieth century fox film corporation and fox international channels us inc for the use of fox formative trademarks used in the company’s paytv and sports programming businesses in australia the “fox licenses” in addition its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products business methods andor services none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations the company derives value and revenue from these assets through among other things print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales subscriptions to its paytv services and distribution andor licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services the sale distribution andor licensing of print and digital books the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services and the operation of websites and other digital properties 

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of content and its success depends on its ability to compete effectively 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content including both traditional and new content providers this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers’ increasing reliance on a variety of content providers including news aggregation websites social media platforms and customized news feeds for the delivery of news and information through the internet often without charge in addition due to the increased availability of highspeed internet access and innovations in content distribution platforms that enable streaming and downloading of programming consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content on smart tvs computers tablets streaming devices and mobile devices through a variety of providers these include iptv providers and svod services such as fetch tv netflix stan amazon prime video hayu and mubi as well as programmers and distributors such as cbs disney and the fta networks that have begun providing content including smaller lowercost programming packages directly to consumers over the internet in some cases also without charge the increasing number of choices available to consumers for video content may cause subscribers to the company’s paytv services to disconnect their services downgrade to smaller less expensive programming packages or purchase certain services from other providers that they would have historically purchased from the company this may in turn adversely affect both the company’s subscription revenue and advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company 

  

the company’s ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on audience acceptance of the highquality differentiated content in its newspapers book titles paytv programming and radio stations in order to retain and grow their audiences consumers and subscribers similarly the success of the company’s digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors which the company generally obtains through shortterm arrangements with mlss real estate brokers real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed andor may be terminated with limited or no notice however when faced with a multitude of media choices consumers may place greater value on when where how and at what price they consume content than they do on the source quality or reliability of such content online traffic is also driven by internet search results and referrals from social media and other platforms search engine results are based on algorithms that change frequently and social media and other platforms may also vary their emphasis on what content to highlight for users any failure to successfully manage and adapt to these changes across the company’s businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to the company’s digital properties lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company’s products and services less valuable for example alternative methods for the delivery storage and consumption of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices often without charge internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading and digital distribution models for books have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where how and at what price they consume content enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the company’s newspapers television programs and other products and the price consumers are willing to pay for such products in addition other technological developments such as those allowing consumers to skip fast forward through or block advertisements may cause changes in consumer behavior that could adversely affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers 

other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with the company often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internetbased products and services additional digital distribution channels such as the internet and online retailers have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s businesses including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

the company must continue to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technologies to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers and are delivered in the manner in which consumers and customers wish to consume them the company may be required to incur 

  

significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior and to attract and retain employees with the skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate its digital and other businesses for example the company expects to make significant investments in its paytv business as it continues to develop and improve the capabilities of its services including potential new svod services the development of new strategies and technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process and there is a risk that the company may not be able to develop and market these opportunities in a timely or costeffective manner and that its responses and strategies to remain competitive including new product offerings and the distribution of its content on a “pay” basis may not be accepted by consumers the company’s failure to respond to and develop new technologies distribution channels and platforms products services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer audience andor user base or its advertisers to decline in some cases precipitously and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses asset values financial condition and results of operations 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers integrated marketing services digital media properties cable channels and other paytv programming and radio stations the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is dependent on a number of factors including 1 demand for the company’s products and services 2 audience fragmentation 3 digital advertising trends 4 its ability to offer advertising products and formats sought by advertisers 5 general economic and business conditions 6 demographics of the customer base 7 advertising rates and 8 advertising effectiveness 

demand for the company’s products and services depends upon the company’s ability to differentiate those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer behaviors and is evaluated based on a variety of metrics for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors advertisers consider when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties including its digital real estate services sites advertisers evaluate consumer demand using metrics such as the number of visits number of users and user engagement any difficulty or failure in accurately measuring demand particularly demand generated through new platforms may lead to undermeasurement and in turn lower advertising pricing and spending 

the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content has driven a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional channels to digital platforms this shift has significantly impacted the company’s print advertising revenues in particular which have declined in each of its last three fiscal years the development of new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising in addition in the past rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising as a result increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues digital advertising networks and exchanges realtime bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers in addition 

  

evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block change the location of or obscure the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices andor block or delete cookies may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage and grow digital audiences derive better demographic and other information about its users develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded and other custom content and video and mobile advertising and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings in recent years large digital platforms such as facebook and google which have extensive audience reach and targeting capabilities have commanded an increasing share of the digital advertising market and the company expects this trend may continue 

the company’s print and digital advertising revenue is also affected generally by overall national and local economic and business conditions including consumer spending housing sales auto sales unemployment rates and job creation advertisers’ budgeting and buying patterns which tend to be cyclical as well as federal state and local election cycles in addition certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company’s advertising revenues including retail technology and finance some of these sectors such as retail are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer reduced demand for the company’s offerings a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets results of operations and financial condition 

the inability to obtain and retain sports and other programming rights could adversely affect the revenue of certain of the company’s operating businesses and programming costs could also increase upon renewal 

competition for popular programming that is licensed from third parties is intense and the success of certain of the company’s operating businesses including its paytv business will depend on among other things their ability to obtain and retain desirable programming and deliver it to subscribers and audiences at competitive prices the paytv industry in particular has continued to experience higher programming costs due to among other things 1 increases imposed by sports and other programmers when offering new programming or upon the expiration of existing contracts 2 the carriage of incremental programming including new services and svod programming and 3 increased competition from other digital media companies including svod providers for the rights to popular or exclusive content certain of the company’s operating businesses including its paytv business are party to contracts for sports and other programming rights with various third parties including professional sports leagues and teams television and motion picture producers and other suppliers these contracts have varying durations and renewal terms and as they expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought however third parties may outbid the company for those rights andor for any new programming offerings in addition professional sports leagues or teams may create their own directtoconsumer sports offerings or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage and the availability of other popular entertainment programming offered by the company and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or in some cases loss of customers or audiences which could in turn adversely affect its revenues in addition the company’s results could be adversely affected if upon renewal escalations in programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates 

  

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 4 with respect to investments risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business 5 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 6 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 7 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 8 in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of specific economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries 9 liabilities both known and unknown associated with the acquired businesses or investments and 10 in some cases increased regulation 

if any acquired business or investment including the recent combination of foxtel and fox sports australia fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing businesses the company’s business results of operations financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected and the company may be required to record noncash impairment charges for the writedown of certain acquired assets 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to its consolidated debt when the debt is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the operations whose cash flows support the ability to repay or refinance such debt as of june 30 2018 the new foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had 575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the company’s policy is to hedge against the risk of foreign currency exchange rate movements with respect to this exposure where commercially reasonable however there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements 

in addition the company is exposed to foreign currency translation risk because it has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in currencies other than the company’s reporting currency primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings when the results of those operations that are reported in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars for inclusion in the company’s consolidated financial statements which could in turn have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets in particular exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to continued political uncertainty in the uk and the negotiation of its exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone and continue to experience periods of economic and market uncertainty including as a result of recent trade disputes between a number of countries these conditions have in the past resulted in among other things a general tightening in the credit and capital markets limited access to 

  

the credit and capital markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition and liquidity including advertising revenues any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company’s business reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers television operations books digital real estate services business radio stations and other consumer products and services in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 32 of its fiscal 2018 revenues from australia as a result the company’s results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market the company also generated approximately 16 of its fiscal 2018 revenues from the uk which continues to experience political regulatory economic and market uncertainty as it negotiates the terms of brexit while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict it could significantly affect the fiscal monetary political and regulatory landscape lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union result in the diminishment or elimination of barrierfree access between the uk and other european union member states and additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company’s businesses in the uk and elsewhere although the company believes that its capitalization operating cash flow and current access to credit and capital markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global credit and capital markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs loss of revenue reputational damage or other harm to the company’s business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s network management are important to its business activities and contain the company’s proprietary confidential and sensitive business information including personal data of its customers and personnel the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and “cloudbased” systems and services that support a variety of business operations network and information systemsrelated events affecting the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies such as computer compromises cyber threats and attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing as well as power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities war human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems could result in disruption of the company’s business andor loss corruption or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and the company’s disaster recovery and business continuity planning may not be sufficient to address all potential cyber events unauthorized parties may also fraudulently induce the company’s employees or other agents to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to the company’s systems facilities or data or those of third parties with whom the company does business in addition any design or manufacturing defects in or the improper implementation of hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security 

  

in recent years there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks have become more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against as a result the risks associated with such an event continue to increase particularly as the company’s digital businesses expand the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date individually or in the aggregate while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data business information including intellectual property and other confidential information to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of the company’s systems 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies could result in a disruption of its operations including degradation or disruption of service equipment damage customer audience or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations and enforcement actions lawsuits remediation costs a loss of customers audience advertisers or revenues and other financial losses if any such failure interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal and credit card data as well as confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact the company’s brand and reputation and materially affect its business 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of adverse developments in the company’s industry and challenging economic and market conditions the company may recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill intangible assets investments and other longlived assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s financial results when the company acquires a business it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities including intangible assets as of the acquisition date the company’s management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company’s cash flows in order to determine whether based on projected discounted future cash flows the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including newspaper mastheads distribution networks publishing imprints radio broadcast licenses trademarks and trade names publishing rights and customer relationships during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the business environment credit and capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions for example any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights andor consumer acceptance of new products including new svod services could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets 

  

investments or other longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations for example in fiscal 2018 the company recognized noncash impairment charges of 280 million primarily related to news america marketing and fox sports australia and a 957 million noncash writedown of its investment in foxtel in addition as of june 30 2018 the company had approximately 170 million of goodwill that is at risk for future impairment because the fair value of the corresponding reporting unit was equal to its carrying value the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it and the significant leverage of its new foxtel operating subsidiaries could limit the ability of those subsidiaries to access the credit and capital markets and have other adverse effects 

from time to time the company may need or desire to access the credit and capital markets to obtain financing although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place including the company’s revolving credit facility will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions the company’s access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors in addition as a result of the transaction the company now consolidates the debt of its new foxtel operating subsidiaries those subsidiaries have significant leverage that could limit or prevent them from incurring additional debt or refinancing or otherwise extending the maturities of their existing debt as of june 30 2018 the new foxtel operating subsidiaries’ total outstanding indebtedness was 16 billion including 370 million due in fiscal 2019 with the remainder having various maturities through fiscal 2025 factors impacting the company’s ability to access the credit and capital markets include but are not limited to 1 the financial performance of the company andor its operating subsidiaries as applicable 2 the company’s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating andor the credit rating of its operating subsidiaries as applicable 3 the provisions of any relevant debt instruments credit agreements indentures and similar or associated documents collectively the “debt documents” 4 the liquidity of the overall credit and capital markets and 5 the state of the economy there can be no assurance that the company particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating will continue to have access to the credit and capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

the company’s consolidated debt could also have other adverse effects a portion of the outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates which exposes the company to the risk of interest rate fluctuations if interest rates increase the applicable debt service obligations will increase which could reduce available cash flow and make it more difficult to make scheduled debt payments andor limit the amount of cash available for operations including investments and capital expenditures although the company hedges a portion of the exposure to these interest rate movements there can be no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so at a reasonable cost or at all or that there will not be a default by any of the counterparties to those arrangements in addition the new foxtel operating subsidiaries’ outstanding debt documents contain significant financial and operating covenants that may limit their operational and financial flexibility subject to certain exceptions these covenants restrict or prohibit these operating subsidiaries from among other things undertaking certain transactions disposing of properties or assets including subsidiary stock merging or consolidating with any other person making financial accommodation available giving guarantees entering into certain other financing arrangements creating or permitting certain liens engaging in transactions with affiliates making repayments of other loans and undergoing fundamental business changes these instruments also generally include financial covenants requiring the new foxtel operating subsidiaries to maintain specified total debt to ebitda and interest coverage ratios in the event any of these covenants are breached and such breach results in a default under any of the new foxtel operating subsidiaries’ debt documents the lenders or noteholders as applicable may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the applicable debt documents which could result in a default under other outstanding debt documents and could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business results of operation and financial condition 

  

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests in addition laws and regulations in some international jurisdictions differ from those in the united states and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply 

the company’s australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy regulation or legislation or the application or enforcement thereof applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general this includes 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 the company’s business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which have implications for how such data is managed many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application complying with these laws and regulations could be costly require the company to change its business practices or limit or restrict aspects of the company’s business in a manner adverse to its business operations including by inhibiting or preventing the collection of information that would enable it to provide more targeted datadriven advertising offerings the company’s failure to comply even if inadvertent or in good faith or as a result of a compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems by a third party could result in exposure to enforcement by us federal or state or foreign governments or private actors as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage an example of such a law is the european union’s gdpr which recently went into effect and expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increases maximum penalties for noncompliance see “governmental regulation—data privacy and security” for more information finally because some of the company’s products and services are available on the internet it may be subject to laws or regulations exposing it to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence 

in addition the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press following the inquiry the uk government established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body publishers who are not members of an approved regulator including the 

  

company may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances the majority of the uk press including news uk has established an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso ipso which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the uk these powers which include the ability to impose fines of up to £1 million for systemic breaches of ipso’s editor’s code of practice may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance depending on the political environment the second phase of the leveson inquiry may be commenced investigating the relationship between the press and the police 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions 

adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company’s business practices and operating results 

from time to time the company is party to litigation as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies including with respect to antitrust tax data privacy and security intellectual property and other matters see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 16 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm andor significant monetary damages injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition as well as the company’s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted in addition regardless of merit or outcome such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors 

the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition 

the company is subject to taxation in us federal state and local jurisdictions and various nonus jurisdictions including australia and the uk the company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws regulations practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly from period to period depending on among other things the geographic mix of the company’s profits and losses changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company’s deferred tax assets evaluating and estimating the company’s tax provision current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment and there are often transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

the company’s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns or positions taken by the company and as a result taxrelated settlements or litigation may occur resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or its taxes in the future could increase which could adversely affect its operating results and financial condition

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of 21st century fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox lachlan k murdoch who serves as the company’s cochairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox and james r murdoch who serves as a director of the company and chief executive officer of 21st century fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement the company and 

  

21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to 21st century fox instead of the company as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation the provisions in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company 

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws tax sharing and indemnification agreement separation and distribution agreement and delaware law the company’s third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 june 2015 and again in june 2018 pursuant to the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and 

  

class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2021 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 7 2018 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 7 2018 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 7 2018 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the third amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

 news and information services 

revenue at the news and information services segment is derived primarily from the sale of advertising circulation and subscriptions as well as licensing adverse changes in general market conditions for advertising continue to affect revenues advertising revenues at the news and information services segment are also subject to seasonality with revenues typically being highest in the company’s second fiscal quarter due to the endofyear holiday season in its main operating geographies circulation and subscription revenues can be greatly affected by changes in the prices of the company’s andor competitors’ products as well as by promotional activities 

  

operating expenses include costs related to paper production distribution third party printing editorial commissions and radio sports rights selling general and administrative expenses include promotional expenses salaries employee benefits rent and other routine overhead

 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 revenues at the subscription video services segment increased 10 million or 2 as compared to fiscal 2016 the revenue increase was primarily due to the acquisition of anc which contributed 20 million of revenue in fiscal 2017 and the 12 million positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations these increases were partially offset by lower affiliate revenues of 11 million at fox sports australia and the 10 million impact of the absence of the 53rd week in fiscal 2017 

for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 segment ebitda at the subscription video services segment decreased 1 million or 1 as compared to fiscal 2016 the decrease in segment ebitda was due to the 3 million negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations as the impact of lower revenues at fox sports australia were offset by lower programming rights costs

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation 

free cash flow available to news corporation is a nongaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures “free cash flow” less rea group free cash flow plus cash dividends received from rea group free cash flow available to news corporation excludes cash flows from discontinued operations free cash flow available to news corporation should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for cash flows from continuing operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap free cash flow available to news corporation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow 

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash that is available to be used to strengthen the company’s balance sheet and for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions dividend payouts and repurchasing stock the company believes excluding rea group’s free cash flow and including dividends received from rea group provides users of its consolidated financial statements with a measure of the amount of cash flow that is readily available to the company as rea group is a separately listed public company in australia and must declare a dividend in order for the company to have access to its share of rea group’s cash balance the company believes free cash flow available to news corporation provides a more conservative view of the company’s free cash flow because this presentation includes only that amount of cash the company actually receives from rea group which has generally been lower than the company’s unadjusted free cash flow 

a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period 

  

the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities to free cash flow available to news corporation 

 

 free cash flow available to news corporation increased 136 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2018 to 249 million from 113 million in fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher cash provided by continuing operating activities as discussed above partially offset by higher capital expenditures 

free cash flow available to news corporation decreased 497 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 to 113 million from 610 million in fiscal 2016 the decrease was primarily due to lower cash provided by continuing operating activities as discussed above as well as higher rea group free cash flow 

borrowings 

as of june 30 2018 the company had total borrowings of 195 billion including the current portion the company’s borrowings as of such date reflect 16 billion of outstanding debt incurred by certain subsidiaries of new foxtel together with new foxtel the “foxtel group” that the company consolidated upon completion of the transaction the foxtel group debt includes us private placement senior unsecured notes and drawn amounts under its revolving credit facilities with maturities ranging from 2019 to 2024 approximately 370 million a500 million aggregate principal amount outstanding will mature during fiscal 2019 and the company expects to fund these debt repayments primarily with new borrowings the foxtel group’s borrowings are guaranteed by certain members of the foxtel group in accordance with asc 805 these debt instruments were recorded at fair value as of the transaction date during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 the foxtel group had repayments of 119 million and borrowings of 42 million under its working capital facility 

the company’s borrowings as of june 30 2018 also reflect the incurrence of approximately 53 million of indebtedness by rea group during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 to fund the acquisition of hometrack australia and the repayment of approximately 93 million a120 million for the first tranche of its a480 million unsecured revolving loan facility which matured in december 2017 the second tranche of approximately 89 million a120 million will mature in december 2018 and the company expects rea group to fund this debt repayment primarily with cash on hand 

the company has additional borrowing capacity under its unsecured 650 million revolving credit facility the “facility” which can be increased up to a maximum amount of 900 million at the company’s request the lenders’ commitments to make the facility available terminate on october 23 2020 provided the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances for up to two additional oneyear periods as of the date of this filing the company has not borrowed any funds under the facility in addition the company has 198 million of undrawn commitments under foxtel group’s revolving credit facilities 

the company’s borrowings contains customary representations covenants and events of default the company was in compliance with all such covenants at june 30 2018 

see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details regarding the company’s outstanding debt including certain information about interest rates maturities covenants and restrictions related to such debt arrangements 

  

commitments 

the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements “firm commitments” to make future payments these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations the following table summarizes the company’s material firm commitments as of june 30 2018 

 

  

       the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

the table also excludes the company’s pension obligations other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 29 million and 26 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 respectively future plan 

  

contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 17 million in fiscal 2019 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 9 million in fiscal 2019 see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

contingencies 

the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations including those discussed in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters fees expenses fines penalties judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable see note 16—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid however these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress or as settlements or litigations occur 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

the company’s longlived assets include goodwill finitelived and indefinitelived intangible assets and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

  

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 the company early adopted asu 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” “asu 201704” which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and instead requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value under asu 201704 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill in performing the valuation the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach methodologies 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates longterm growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

the performance of the company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in 43 million of impairments of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2018 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 85250 longterm growth rates ranging from 1030 and royalty rates ranging from 0575 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums of 10 

significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

  

the fair values of the company’s reporting units in fiscal 2018 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 0 to 45 no material impairments were identified any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment failing the 2018 impairment analysis which would have required the company to record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value the news and information services segment has a reporting unit with goodwill of approximately 170 million at june 30 2018 that is atrisk for future impairment the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

programming costs 

costs incurred in acquiring program rights or producing programs are accounted for in accordance with asc 920 “entertainment—broadcasters” program rights and the related liabilities are recorded at the gross amount of the liabilities when the license period has begun the cost of the program is determinable and the program is accepted and available for airing programming costs are amortized over the license period or expected useful life of each program the company regularly reviews its programming assets to ensure they continue to reflect net realizable value any change in circumstances may result in a writedown of the asset to fair value the company has single and multiyear contracts for broadcast rights of sporting events the costs of sports contracts are primarily charged to expense over the respective season as events are aired for sports contracts with dedicated channels the company amortizes the sports programming rights costs over 12 months 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

  

the company’s annual tax rate is based primarily on its geographic income and statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax benefit expense 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 17—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the weighted average expected longterm rate of return of 47 for fiscal 2019 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 23 equities 65 fixedincome securities and 12 cash and other investments 

the company recorded 3 million 1 million and 8 million in net periodic benefit costs income in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively in fiscal 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans for fiscal 2016 the company estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate for each country in which the company has plans derived from a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the new method utilized a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the change was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which was applied prospectively this change in estimate is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods 

  

although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 32 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2019 net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 

 

 the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 47 for 2019 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2018 were approximately 442 million which decreased from approximately 595 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2017 this decrease of 153 million was primarily due to increased discount rates lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans 

the company made contributions of 29 million 26 million and 26 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2018 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 17 million in fiscal 2019 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 18—other postretirement benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the 

  

sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates interest rates and stock prices when deemed appropriate the company uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency interest rate swaps interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain risk exposures the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk interest rate risk and other relevant market risks the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency rates 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2018 and 2017 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2018 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 39 million and 12 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 8 million and 1 million respectively on an annual basis 

derivatives and hedging 

as a result of the transaction the company consolidated foxtel’s portfolio of debt and derivative instruments as of june 30 2018 the new foxtel operating subsidiaries whose functional currency is australian dollars had 575 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness denominated in us dollars the remaining borrowings are denominated in australian dollars new foxtel utilizes crosscurrency swaps designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to 

  

interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the total notional value of these crosscurrency interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges were 296 million a400 million and 74 million a100 million respectively as of june 30 2018 new foxtel also has a portfolio of foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the exchange risk related to us dollar payments for license fees the notional value of these foreign exchange contracts was 100 million as of june 30 2018 

in addition to derivative instruments that are designated and qualify for hedge accounting the company also uses certain derivatives not designated as accounting hedges to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk these are referred to as economic hedges the total notional value of cross currency interest rate derivatives was 75 million as of june 30 2018 refer to the table below for further details of the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments which are subject to foreign exchange risk 

 

 interest rates 

the company’s current financing arrangements and facilities include approximately 650 million of outstanding fixedrate debt and approximately 13 billion of outstanding variablerate bank facilities before adjustments for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs see note 9—borrowings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements fixed and variablerate debts are impacted differently by changes in interest rates a change in the interest rate or yield of fixedrate debt will only impact the fair market value of such debt while a change in the interest rate of variablerate debt will impact interest expense as well as the amount of cash required to service such debt in connection with these borrowings new foxtel has utilized certain derivative instruments to swap us dollar denominated fixed interest payments for australian dollar denominated variable rate as discussed above new foxtel utilizes crosscurrency swaps designated as both cash flow hedges and fair value hedges to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk related to interest and principal payments on its us dollar denominated debt the company has also utilized certain derivative instruments to swap australian dollar denominated variable interest payments for australian dollar denominated fixed rates as of june 30 2018 the notional amount of interest rate swap contracts outstanding was 518 million a700 million refer to the table above for further details of the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments which are subject to interest rate risk 

  

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 93 million as of june 30 2018 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately 9 million before tax any changes in fair value of the company’s common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed otherthantemporary 

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2018 or june 30 2017 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2018 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

governmental regulation 

general 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on the company’s interests 

australian media regulation 

the company’s subscription television interests are subject to australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority 

  

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50 of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters and b the broadcasting services act also may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including for example preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area 

data privacy and security 

our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us certain of the company’s websites mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent in addition the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements most states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union and australia for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive directive 9546ec fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25 2018 the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection processing use and security of personal data contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthens the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continues to restrict the transborder flow of such data requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification significantly increases penalties for noncompliance up to 20 million euros or approximately 23 million us dollars or 4 of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year whichever is higher and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication eprivacy directive to among other things amend the current directive’s rules on the use of cookies 

in 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the useu safe harbor framework one of the legal mechanisms through which personal data could be transferred from the european union to the united states and the mechanism relied upon by the company with respect to certain personal data transfers among the company’s businesses and between the company and some of its third party service providers in 2016 the european commission adopted a new transfer mechanism between the us and the eu called the privacy shield the company has not certified to and does not rely on the privacy shield framework for data transfers among the company’s businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms however certain of the company’s service providers do rely on the privacy shield the privacy shield is subject to significant uncertainty including an annual review procedure by us and eu authorities that could affect the company’s or its service providers’ obligations thereunder the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data including the european union standard 

  

model contractual clauses are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted could cause the company to incur additional costs require us to change business practices or affect the manner in which we provide our services 

in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain in flux and evolving in the united states and internationally the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by former prime minister david cameron in mid2011 a royal charter on selfregulation of the press was granted in 2013 which established a press recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies once approved by the press recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers in addition to the royal charter and establishment of the new press recognition panel legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances 

in late 2013 publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead the independent press standards organisation or ipso ipso which began operating in september 2014 currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code of practice and levy fines of up to £1 million ipso has also introduced a pilot arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications the burdens ipso imposes on the print media including the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance 

uk radio broadcasting regulation 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant 

  

authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions 

intellectual property 

the company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in newspapers books television programming and other content and technologies trademarks in names and logos trade names domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights in addition its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products business methods andor services none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations the company derives value and revenue from these assets through among other things print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales the sale distribution andor licensing of print and digital books the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution andor licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services 

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

tablestart 


 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers integrated marketing services digital media properties and radio stations the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and paytv programming expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic and business conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns national and local economic conditions particularly in major metropolitan markets affect the levels of retail national and classified advertising revenue changes in gross domestic product consumer spending housing sales auto sales unemployment rates and job creation as well as federal state and local election cycles all impact demand for advertising certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company’s advertising revenues including retail technology and finance some of these sectors such as retail are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company’s products and services demographics of the customer base advertising rates and results observed by advertisers for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties including its digital real estate sites advertisers use various metrics to evaluate consumer demand such as the number of visits number of users and user engagement demand for the company’s products and services depends in turn upon the company’s ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner technological and other developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers 

the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional print to digital and the company’s print advertising revenues have declined in each of its last three fiscal years the development of new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising in addition in the past rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising as a result increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues digital advertising networks and exchanges realtime bidding and other programmatic 

  

buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers in addition evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising including the industrywide standard on viewability as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block change the location of or obscure the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices andor block or delete cookies may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage and grow digital audiences derive better demographic and other information about its users develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded content and video and mobile advertising and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers reduced demand for the company’s offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content including both traditional and new content providers this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers’ increasing reliance on a variety of content providers including news aggregation websites social media platforms and customized news feeds for the delivery of news and information through the internet often without charge internet sites and mobile applications devoted to recruitment automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company’s newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales in addition due to innovations in content distribution platforms consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content on television sets and mobile devices in some cases also without charge which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates’ television programming and paytv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company 

the company’s ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on audience acceptance of the highquality differentiated content in its newspapers book titles cable channels paytv programming and radio stations in order to retain and grow their audiences similarly the success of the company’s digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors which the company generally obtains through shortterm arrangements with mlss real estate brokers real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed andor may be terminated with limited or no notice however when faced with a multitude of media choices consumers may place greater value on when where how and at what price they consume content than they do on the source quality or reliability of such content online traffic is also driven by internet search results which are based on algorithms that may among other things deprioritize the company’s paid content any failure to 

  

successfully manage and adapt to changes in search engine optimization across the company’s businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to our digital properties lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company’s products and services less valuable for example alternative methods for the delivery storage and consumption of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices often without charge digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where how and at what price they consume digital content enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the company’s newspapers television programs and other products and if the company is unable to introduce engaging useful and reliable new products tailored for and available across these new devices and platforms including mobile the company’s revenues results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with us often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internetbased products and services additional digital distribution channels such as the internet and online retailers have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s businesses including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

in order to succeed the company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior and to attract and retain employees with the skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate its digital businesses and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive including distribution of its content on a “pay” basis may not be adopted by consumers the company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technologies distribution channels and platforms products services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer audience andor user base or its advertisers to decline in some cases precipitously and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses asset values financial condition and results of operations 

the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company’s operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period and programming costs could also increase upon renewal 

the sports rights contracts between certain of the company’s operating businesses on the one hand and various professional sports leagues and teams on the other have varying duration and renewal terms as these contracts expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought however third parties may outbid the current rights holders 

  

for the rights contracts in addition professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and its affiliates and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or in some cases loss of customers or audiences which could in turn adversely affect its revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings which could in turn have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets in particular the british pound sterling experienced a significant weakening against the us dollar following the uk’s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the uk’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” this weakness caused the local currency results of the company’s uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars which adversely affected our reported results the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against the british pound sterling resulted in a decrease in reported revenues at our uk newspapers of approximately 177 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 as compared to the prior year exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to recent political uncertainty in the uk and the negotiation of its exit from the european union 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone and continue to experience periods of economic and market uncertainty including following brexit and the most recent us presidential election these conditions have in the past resulted in among other things a general tightening in the credit markets limited access to the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition and liquidity including advertising revenues any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company’s business reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers books digital real estate services business television operations radio stations and other consumer products and services in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 29 of its fiscal 2017 revenues from australia as a result the company’s results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market the company also generated approximately 19 of its fiscal 2017 revenues from the uk which is experiencing a period of economic and market uncertainty as a result of brexit while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict it could significantly affect the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union result in additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an 

  

adverse impact on the company’s businesses in the uk and elsewhere although the company believes that its capitalization operating cash flow and current access to credit markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 4 with respect to investments risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business 5 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 6 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 7 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 8 potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business or investment 9 in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of specific economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries 10 liabilities both known and unknown associated with the acquired businesses or investments and 11 in some cases increased regulation

implementation of hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security in recent years there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks have become more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against as a result the risks associated with such an event continue to increase particularly as the company’s digital businesses expand the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date individually or in the aggregate while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data business information including intellectual property and other confidential information to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies could result in a disruption of its operations customer audience or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations and enforcement actions lawsuits remediation costs a loss of customers audience advertisers or revenues and other financial losses if any such failure interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal credit card confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of adverse developments in the company’s industry and challenging economic and market conditions the company may recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill intangible assets investments and other longlived assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s financial results when the company acquires a business it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities including intangible assets as of the acquisition date the company’s management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company’s cash flows in order to determine whether based on projected discounted future cash flows the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including newspaper mastheads distribution networks publishing imprints radio broadcast licenses trademarks and trade names channel distribution agreements publishing rights and customer relationships during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the business environment capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units any downward revisions in the fair value 

  

of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or other longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations for example in fiscal 2017 the company recognized noncash impairment charges of approximately 785 million primarily related to the writedown of fixed assets at its uk and australian newspapers and a 227 million noncash writedown of the carrying value of its investment in foxtel to fair value in addition as of june 30 2017 the company had approximately 14 billion of goodwill and 12 billion of investments that are at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the corresponding reporting units and investments exceeded their carrying values by less than 3 the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests in addition laws and regulations in some international jurisdictions differ from those in the united states and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply 

the company’s australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy regulation or legislation or the application or enforcement thereof applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general this includes 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company’s business activities are also subject to various laws and regulations in the united states and internationally governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which have implications for how such data is managed complying with these laws and regulations could be costly require us to change our business practices or limit or restrict aspects of the company’s business in a manner adverse to our business operations many of these laws and regulations continue to evolve and substantial uncertainty surrounds their scope and application the company’s failure to comply even if inadvertent or in good faith could result in exposure to enforcement by us federal or state or foreign governments or private actors as well as significant negative publicity and reputational damage an example of such a law is the european union’s 

  

recently adopted gdpr which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increases penalties for noncompliance see “governmental regulation—data privacy and security” for more information finally because some of our products and services are available on the internet we may be subject to laws or regulations exposing us to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence 

in addition the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk are now subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by former prime minister david cameron in mid2011 the uk government subsequently published a royal charter on selfregulation of the press which established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body publishers who are not members of an approved regulator including the company may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances the majority of the uk press including news uk has established an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso which began operating in september 2014 ipso which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the uk these powers which include the ability to impose fines of up to £1 million for systemic breaches of ipso’s editor’s code of practice may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance depending on the political environment the second phase of the leveson inquiry may be commenced investigating the relationship between the press and the police 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions 

adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company’s business practices and operating results 

from time to time the company is party to litigation as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies including with respect to antitrust tax data privacy and security intellectual property and other matters see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 15 to the financial statements for a discussion of certain matters the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm andor significant monetary damages injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition as well as the company’s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted for example in february 2016 the company entered into a settlement agreement relating to an action brought by customers of the nam business pursuant to which it subsequently paid the plaintiffs and their attorneys approximately 250 million the company also settled related claims for approximately 30 million in addition regardless of merit or outcome such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors 

the company could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities 

the company is subject to taxation in us federal state and local jurisdictions and various nonus jurisdictions including australia and the uk the company’s effective tax rate is impacted by the tax laws regulations practices and interpretations in the jurisdictions in which it operates and may fluctuate significantly 

  

from period to period depending on among other things the geographic mix of the company’s profits and losses changes in tax laws and regulations or their application and interpretation the outcome of tax audits and changes in valuation allowances associated with the company’s deferred tax assets evaluating and estimating the company’s tax provision current and deferred tax assets and liabilities and other tax accruals requires significant management judgment and there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 

the company’s tax returns are routinely audited by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in our tax returns or positions taken by the company and as a result taxrelated settlements or litigation may occur resulting in additional income tax liabilities against the company although the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of tax reviews and examinations and any related litigation the final outcomes of these matters could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements as a result the company may be required to recognize additional charges in its statements of operations and pay significant additional amounts with respect to current or prior periods or its taxes in the future could increase which could affect its operating results and financial condition 

in connection with the separation 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” and an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the taxfree status of the separation for us federal income tax purposes the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated if the internal reorganization andor the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable 21st century fox andor the company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st century fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company’s common stock distributed to 21st century fox’s stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox’s tax basis in such shares the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing specifically under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken or omitted to be taken after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions 1 were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel 2 violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement or 3 the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected after consultation with its advisors could result in any such determination the company will be responsible for any taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination in addition other tax authorities could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganizations should be treated as taxable transactions resulting in additional tax liabilities 

recently the us government has indicated that corporate tax reform is a high priority and has proposed sweeping changes to the us tax system these reforms may include changes to corporate tax rates changes in the taxation of income earned outside the united states and taxing previously unremitted foreign earnings at concessional tax rates we cannot determine whether some or all of these or other proposals will be enacted into law or what if any changes may be made to such proposals prior to being enacted into law if us tax laws change in a manner that increases our tax obligations our financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 

  

the company’s international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business operating results and financial condition 

in its fiscal year ended june 30 2017 approximately 54 of the company’s revenues were derived outside the us and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 1 issues related to managing international operations 2 economic uncertainties and volatility in local markets and political or social instability 3 potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations 4 compliance with international laws and regulations including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements 5 compliance with anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 6 restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange and 7 compliance with local labor laws and regulations for example brexit may among other things adversely affect economic and market conditions in the uk and the eu and create uncertainty around doing business in the uk including with respect to data protection and transfer tax rates and the recruitment and retention of employees events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company’s international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition operating results and prospects challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities 

there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

from time to time the company may need or desire to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place including the company’s revolving credit facility will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions the company’s access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including but not limited to 1 the company’s financial performance 2 the company’s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating 3 the liquidity of the overall capital markets and 4 the state of the economy there can be no assurance particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights 

the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy however policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material the company has taken and will continue to take a variety of actions to combat piracy both individually and in some instances together with industry associations however protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed the company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy 

the company’s business relies on certain intellectual property and brands 

the company’s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks trade names copyrights patents domain names and other proprietary rights as well as contractual arrangements including licenses to establish and protect their 

  

intellectual property and brand names the company believes its proprietary trademarks trade names copyrights patents domain names and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position however the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties and effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country or region in which the company operates or where its products are available any failure by the company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition in addition the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims 

newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control 

newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company’s newspaper publishing units during the quarter ended june 30 2017 the company’s average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 10 lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years on a constant currency basis the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the closure and consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers which has led to increases in newsprint prices failure to maintain the company’s current consumption levels further supplier closure and consolidation or the inability to maintain the company’s existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future 

the company’s relationship with nar is an important part of its digital real estate services business in the us and this business could be harmed if it were to lose the benefits of this relationship  

move the company’s digital real estate services business in the us licenses the realtorcom ® trademark and website address as well as the realtor ® trademark from nar pursuant to a trademark license agreement the “nar license” move also operates the realtorcom ® website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration however nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractuallyspecified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods if the operating agreement with nar is terminated the nar license would also terminate and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtorcom ® website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers nar would then be able to operate a realtorcom ® website either by itself or with another third party 

in addition to the contractual limitations and risks described above any adverse developments in move’s business relationship with nar as a result of existing or new areas of conflict or potential conflict between move’s interests and nar’s interests changes in the real estate industry or other causes could also adversely affect move’s business particularly as many of its customers and data providers are members of have interests that are closely aligned with or are otherwise influenced by nar 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

in a variety of the company’s businesses it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins 

the market price of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its 

  

industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 investor perception of the company and the industries in which it operates 12 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 13 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders and 14 overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions 

the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the us 

the federal communications commission “fcc” has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations television broadcast networks and newspapers the “broadcast ownership rules” and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest the “program access rules” under the fcc’s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above the murdoch family trust’s ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company’s businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules consequently the company’s future conduct including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company’s acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator may affect 21st century fox’s ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules therefore the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires after the distribution date newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business then the company will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules in addition the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor including a cable television operator if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business 

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox and certain of the company’s officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of 21st century fox which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of 21st century fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox lachlan k murdoch who serves as the company’s cochairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox and james r murdoch who serves as a director of the company and chief executive officer of 21st century fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox 

  

regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to 21st century fox instead of the company as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation the provisions in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company 

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws tax sharing and indemnification agreement separation and distribution agreement and delaware law the company’s second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

  

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 and again in june 2015 pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2018 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 7 2017 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 7 2017 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 7 2017 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

commitments 

the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements “firm commitments” to make future payments these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations the following table summarizes the company’s material firm commitments as of june 30 2017 

 

  

    the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

the table also excludes the company’s pension obligations other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 26 million and 26 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 24 million in fiscal 2018 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 9 million in fiscal 2018 see note 16—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  

contingencies 

the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations including those discussed in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters fees expenses fines penalties judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable see note 15—commitments and contingencies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid however these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress as subsidiaries of 21st century fox prior to the separation the company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st century fox for the consolidated us federal income taxes of the 21st century fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the company or any of the company’s domestic subsidiaries were a member of the 21st century fox consolidated group consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the 21st century fox consolidated group in conjunction with the separation the company entered into the tax sharing and indemnification agreement with 21st century fox which requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service “irs” or other taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

the company’s longlived assets include goodwill finitelived and indefinite lived intangible assets and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar 

  

economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 the company early adopted asu 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” “asu 201704” which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and instead requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value under asu 201704 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill in performing the valuation the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach methodologies 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates longterm growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

the performance of the company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in 88 million of impairments of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2017 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 90250 longterm growth rates ranging from 0033 and royalty rates ranging from 0575 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 1015 

significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

the fair values of the company’s reporting units in fiscal 2017 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 3 to 23 no material impairments were identified any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment failing the 2017 impairment analysis which would have required the 

  

company to record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value the news and information services segment has a reporting unit with goodwill of approximately 14 billion at june 30 2017 that is atrisk for future impairment additionally the company has certain other reporting units with goodwill balances of 83 million which are considered to be atrisk the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 the company recognized total fixed asset writedowns of 679 million primarily at news uk and news corp australia 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company reduced its outlook for the uk newspapers due to the impact of adverse print advertising and print circulation trends on the future expected performance of the business as a result the company recognized a noncash impairment charge of approximately 360 million related to the writedown of fixed assets at the uk newspapers the writedown was comprised of approximately 252 million related to print sites 85 million related to printing presses and print related equipment and 23 million related to capitalized software significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 85 and a 10 long term growth rate 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the company recognized a noncash impairment charge of approximately 310 million primarily related to the writedown of fixed assets at the australian newspapers the writedown was a result of the impact of adverse trends on the future expected performance of the australian newspapers where revenue declines from continued weakness in the print advertising market accelerated during the second quarter the writedown was comprised of approximately 149 million related to printing presses and print related equipment 77 million related to facilities 66 million related to capitalized software and 18 million related to tradenames significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 115 and no longterm growth as of june 30 2017 the company determined that the remaining carrying value of fixed assets reviewed as part of the analysis continue to be recoverable 

  

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax benefit expense 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 16—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the weighted average expected longterm rate of return of 51 for fiscal 2018 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 22 equities 62 fixedincome securities and 16 cash and other investments 

the company recorded 1 million 8 million and 4 million in net periodic benefit costs income in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in fiscal 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans for fiscal 2016 and previous periods presented the company estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate for each country in which the company has plans derived from 

  

a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the new method utilized a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which is applied prospectively this change in estimate is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods 

although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 30 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2018 net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 

 

 the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 51 for fiscal 2018 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2017 were approximately 595 million which decreased from approximately 610 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2016 this decrease of 15 million was primarily due to favorable asset returns lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans 

the company made contributions of 26 million 26 million and 9 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the 

  

company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 24 million in fiscal 2018 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency rates 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk foreign operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 and 2016 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2017 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 32 million and 12 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 6 million and 04 million respectively on an annual basis 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 97 million as of june 30 2017 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately 10 million before tax any changes in fair value of the company’s common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed otherthantemporary 

  

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2017 or june 30 2016 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2017 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

governmental regulation 

general 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on the company’s interests 

australian media regulation 

the company’s subscription television interests are subject to australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority 

  

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50 of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters and b the broadcasting services act also may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including for example preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area 

data privacy and security 

our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us certain of the company’s websites mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent in addition the federal trade commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements most states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union and australia for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive directive 9546ec fully applicable and enforceable as of may 25 2018 the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection processing use and security of personal data contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthens the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continues to restrict the transborder flow of such data requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification significantly increases penalties for noncompliance up to 20 million euros or approximately 23 million us dollars or 4 of an entity’s worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year whichever is higher and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities the european union is also considering an update to its privacy and electronic communication eprivacy directive to among other things amend the current directive’s rules on the use of cookies 

in 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the useu safe harbor framework one of the legal mechanisms through which personal data could be transferred from the european union to the united states and the mechanism relied upon by the company with respect to certain personal data transfers among the company’s businesses and between the company and some of its third party service providers in 2016 the european commission adopted a new transfer mechanism between the us and the eu called the privacy shield the company has not certified to and does not rely on the privacy shield framework for data transfers among the company’s businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms however certain of the company’s service providers do rely on the privacy shield the privacy shield is subject to significant uncertainty including an annual review procedure by us and eu authorities that could affect the company’s or its service providers’ obligations thereunder the other mechanisms that the company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the european data protection requirements for transfers of data including the european union standard 

  

model contractual clauses are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted could cause the company to incur additional costs require us to change business practices or affect the manner in which we provide our services 

in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain in flux and evolving in the united states and internationally the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by former prime minister david cameron in mid2011 a royal charter on selfregulation of the press was granted in 2013 which established a press recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies once approved by the press recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers in addition to the royal charter and establishment of the new press recognition panel legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances 

in late 2013 publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead the independent press standards organisation or ipso ipso which began operating in september 2014 currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the press recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code of practice and levy fines of up to £1 million ipso has also introduced a pilot arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications the burdens ipso imposes on the print media including the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance 

uk radio broadcasting regulation 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant 

  

authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions

the company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in newspapers books television programming and other content and technologies trademarks in names and logos trade names domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights in addition its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products business methods andor services none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations the company derives value and revenue from these assets through among other things print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales the sale distribution andor licensing of print and digital books the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution andor licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services 

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

 you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers integrated marketing services digital media properties and radio stations the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and paytv programming expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic and business conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns national and local economic conditions particularly in major metropolitan markets affect the levels of retail national and classified advertising revenue changes in gross domestic product consumer spending housing sales auto sales unemployment rates and job creation as well as federal state and local election cycles all impact demand for advertising certain sectors of the economy account for a significant portion of the company’s advertising revenues including retail technology and finance some of these sectors such as retail are more susceptible to weakness in economic conditions and have also been under pressure from increased online competition a decline in the economic prospects of these and other advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company’s products and services demographics of the customer base advertising rates and results observed by advertisers for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers ratings points for its cable channels and number of listeners for its radio stations are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties including its digital real estate sites advertisers use various metrics to evaluate consumer demand such as the number of visits number of users and user engagement demand for the company’s products and services depends in turn upon the company’s ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner technological and other developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers 

the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional print to digital and the company’s print advertising revenues have declined in each of its last three fiscal years the development of new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising in addition in the past rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising as a result increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues digital advertising networks and exchanges realtime bidding and other programmatic 

  

buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers in addition evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising including the industrywide standard on viewability as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block change the location of or obscure the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices andor block or delete cookies may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage and grow digital audiences derive better demographic and other information about its users develop new digital advertising products and formats such as branded content and video and mobile advertising and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its various platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers reduced demand for the company’s offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content including both traditional and new content providers this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers’ increasing reliance on a variety of content providers including news aggregation websites social media platforms and customized news feeds for the delivery of news and information through the internet often without charge internet sites and mobile applications devoted to recruitment automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company’s newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales in addition due to innovations in content distribution platforms consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content on television sets and mobile devices in some cases also without charge which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates’ television programming and paytv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company 

the company’s ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on audience acceptance of the highquality differentiated content in its newspapers book titles cable channels paytv programming and radio stations in order to retain and grow their audiences similarly the success of the company’s digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors which the company generally obtains through shortterm arrangements with mlss real estate brokers real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed andor may be terminated with limited or no notice however when faced with a multitude of media choices consumers may place greater value on when where how and at what price they consume content than they do on the source quality or reliability of such content online traffic is also driven by internet search results which are based on algorithms that may among other things deprioritize the company’s paid content any failure to 

  

successfully manage and adapt to changes in search engine optimization across the company’s businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to our digital properties lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic or otherwise adversely affect the company’s business 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company’s products and services less valuable for example alternative methods for the delivery storage and consumption of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices often without charge digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where how and at what price they consume digital content enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for the company’s newspapers television programs and other products and if the company is unable to introduce engaging useful and reliable new products tailored for and available across these new devices and platforms including mobile the company’s revenues results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with us often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internetbased products and services additional digital distribution channels such as the internet and online retailers have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s businesses including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

in order to succeed the company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures and other costs in order to respond to new technologies new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior and to attract and retain employees with the skill sets and knowledge base needed to successfully operate its digital businesses and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive including distribution of its content on a “pay” basis may not be adopted by consumers the company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technologies distribution channels and platforms products services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer audience andor user base or its advertisers to decline in some cases precipitously and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses asset values financial condition and results of operations 

the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company’s operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period and programming costs could also increase upon renewal 

the sports rights contracts between certain of the company’s operating businesses on the one hand and various professional sports leagues and teams on the other have varying duration and renewal terms as these contracts expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought however third parties may outbid the current rights holders 

  

for the rights contracts in addition professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and its affiliates and lead to customer or audience dissatisfaction or in some cases loss of customers or audiences which could in turn adversely affect its revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings which could in turn have an adverse effect on its reported results of operations in a given period or in specific markets in particular the british pound sterling experienced a significant weakening against the us dollar following the uk’s june 2016 referendum in which voters approved the uk’s exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” this weakness caused the local currency results of the company’s uk operations to be translated into fewer us dollars which adversely affected our reported results the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against the british pound sterling resulted in a decrease in reported revenues at our uk newspapers of approximately 177 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 as compared to the prior year exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling are expected to remain volatile due to recent political uncertainty in the uk and the negotiation of its exit from the european union 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone and continue to experience periods of economic and market uncertainty including following brexit and the most recent us presidential election these conditions have in the past resulted in among other things a general tightening in the credit markets limited access to the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition and liquidity including advertising revenues any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company’s business reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers books digital real estate services business television operations radio stations and other consumer products and services in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets and generated approximately 29 of its fiscal 2017 revenues from australia as a result the company’s results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market the company also generated approximately 19 of its fiscal 2017 revenues from the uk which is experiencing a period of economic and market uncertainty as a result of brexit while the impact of brexit is difficult to predict it could significantly affect the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union result in additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an 

  

adverse impact on the company’s businesses in the uk and elsewhere although the company believes that its capitalization operating cash flow and current access to credit markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 4 with respect to investments risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business 5 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 6 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 7 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 8 potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business or investment 9 in the case of foreign acquisitions and investments the impact of specific economic tax currency political legal and regulatory risks associated with the relevant countries 10 liabilities both known and unknown associated with the acquired businesses or investments and 11 in some cases increased regulation 

if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing businesses the company’s business results of operations financial condition and reputation could be adversely affected and the company may be required to record noncash impairment charges for the writedown of certain acquired assets 

the company does not have the right to manage foxtel which means it is not able to cause foxtel to operate or make corporate decisions in a manner that is favorable to the company

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs loss of revenue or other harm to our business 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s network management are important to its business activities the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and “cloudbased” systems and services that support a variety of business operations network and information systemsrelated events affecting the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies such as computer compromises cyber threats and attacks computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing as well as power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities war human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems could result in disruption of the company’s business andor loss corruption or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information in addition any design or manufacturing defects in or the improper 

  

implementation of hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security in recent years there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks have become more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against as a result the risks associated with such an event continue to increase particularly as the company’s digital businesses expand the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date individually or in the aggregate while the company and its vendors have developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data business information including intellectual property and other confidential information to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies could result in a disruption of its operations customer audience or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations and enforcement actions lawsuits remediation costs a loss of customers audience advertisers or revenues and other financial losses if any such failure interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal credit card confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy in addition media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of adverse developments in the company’s industry and challenging economic and market conditions the company may recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill intangible assets investments and other longlived assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s financial results when the company acquires a business it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities including intangible assets as of the acquisition date the company’s management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company’s cash flows in order to determine whether based on projected discounted future cash flows the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including newspaper mastheads distribution networks publishing imprints radio broadcast licenses trademarks and trade names channel distribution agreements publishing rights and customer relationships during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the business environment capital markets or the economy generally and actual or projected operating results require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units any downward revisions in the fair value 

  

of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or other longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations for example in fiscal 2017 the company recognized noncash impairment charges of approximately 785 million primarily related to the writedown of fixed assets at its uk and australian newspapers and a 227 million noncash writedown of the carrying value of its investment in foxtel to fair value in addition as of june 30 2017 the company had approximately 14 billion of goodwill and 12 billion of investments that are at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the corresponding reporting units and investments exceeded their carrying values by less than 3 the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests in addition laws and regulations in some international jurisdictions differ from those in the united states and the enforcement of those laws and regulations may be inconsistent and unpredictable the company may incur substantial costs or be required to change its business practices in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations and could incur substantial penalties or other liabilities in the event of any failure to comply

recently adopted gdpr which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increases penalties for noncompliance see “governmental regulation—data privacy and security” for more information finally because some of our products and services are available on the internet we may be subject to laws or regulations exposing us to liability or compliance obligations even in jurisdictions where the company does not have a substantial presence 

in addition the company’s newspaper publishing businesses in the uk are now subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by former prime minister david cameron in mid2011 the uk government subsequently published a royal charter on selfregulation of the press which established a press recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press regulatory body publishers who are not members of an approved regulator including the company may be subject to exemplary damages in privacy and libel cases and if section 40 of the crime and courts act 2013 is enacted the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances the majority of the uk press including news uk has established an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso which began operating in september 2014 ipso which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the press recognition panel has powers to impose burdens on its print media members in the uk these powers which include the ability to impose fines of up to £1 million for systemic breaches of ipso’s editor’s code of practice may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance depending on the political environment the second phase of the leveson inquiry may be commenced investigating the relationship between the press and the police 

the company’s radio stations in the uk and ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations although the company expects its licenses will where relevant be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration there can be no assurance that this will be the case noncompliance by the company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations including of the relevant authority could result in fines additional license conditions license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions

regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to 21st century fox instead of the company as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation the provisions in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company 

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws tax sharing and indemnification agreement separation and distribution agreement and delaware law the company’s second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

  

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 and again in june 2015 pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2018 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 7 2017 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 7 2017 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 7 2017 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in the company’s tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes ultimately expected to be paid however these liabilities may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as tax examinations continue to progress as subsidiaries of 21st century fox prior to the separation the company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st century fox for the consolidated us federal income taxes of the 21st century fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the company or any of the company’s domestic subsidiaries were a member of the 21st century fox consolidated group consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the 21st century fox consolidated group in conjunction with the separation the company entered into the tax sharing and indemnification agreement with 21st century fox which requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service “irs” or other taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

the company’s longlived assets include goodwill finitelived and indefinite lived intangible assets and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar 

  

economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 the company early adopted asu 201704 “intangibles—goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment” “asu 201704” which eliminates step 2 from the goodwill impairment test and instead requires an entity to perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and to recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value under asu 201704 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill in performing the valuation the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit primarily by using a discounted cash flow analysis and marketbased valuation approach methodologies 

determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments including judgments about appropriate discount rates longterm growth rates relevant comparable company earnings multiples and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

the performance of the company’s annual impairment analysis resulted in 88 million of impairments of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2017 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 90250 longterm growth rates ranging from 0033 and royalty rates ranging from 0575 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation method were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 1015 

significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premiums and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

the fair values of the company’s reporting units in fiscal 2017 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 3 to 23 no material impairments were identified any increase in the discount rate or decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment failing the 2017 impairment analysis which would have required the 

  

company to record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and its carrying value the news and information services segment has a reporting unit with goodwill of approximately 14 billion at june 30 2017 that is atrisk for future impairment additionally the company has certain other reporting units with goodwill balances of 83 million which are considered to be atrisk the company will continue to monitor its goodwill for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of property plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

during the fiscal year ended june 30 2017 the company recognized total fixed asset writedowns of 679 million primarily at news uk and news corp australia 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company reduced its outlook for the uk newspapers due to the impact of adverse print advertising and print circulation trends on the future expected performance of the business as a result the company recognized a noncash impairment charge of approximately 360 million related to the writedown of fixed assets at the uk newspapers the writedown was comprised of approximately 252 million related to print sites 85 million related to printing presses and print related equipment and 23 million related to capitalized software significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 85 and a 10 long term growth rate 

in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the company recognized a noncash impairment charge of approximately 310 million primarily related to the writedown of fixed assets at the australian newspapers the writedown was a result of the impact of adverse trends on the future expected performance of the australian newspapers where revenue declines from continued weakness in the print advertising market accelerated during the second quarter the writedown was comprised of approximately 149 million related to printing presses and print related equipment 77 million related to facilities 66 million related to capitalized software and 18 million related to tradenames significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were a discount rate of 115 and no longterm growth as of june 30 2017 the company determined that the remaining carrying value of fixed assets reviewed as part of the analysis continue to be recoverable 

  

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax benefit expense 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 16—retirement benefit obligations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the weighted average expected longterm rate of return of 51 for fiscal 2018 is based on a weighted average target asset allocation assumption of 22 equities 62 fixedincome securities and 16 cash and other investments 

the company recorded 1 million 8 million and 4 million in net periodic benefit costs income in the statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively in fiscal 2017 the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans for fiscal 2016 and previous periods presented the company estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate for each country in which the company has plans derived from 

  

a yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation the new method utilized a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the company changed to the new method to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which is applied prospectively this change in estimate is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods 

although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 30 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2018 net periodic benefit costs income the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk australia and other foreign countries as of the measurement date 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 

 

 the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 51 for fiscal 2018 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and an expectation of future long term investment returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2017 were approximately 595 million which decreased from approximately 610 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2016 this decrease of 15 million was primarily due to favorable asset returns lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses for the primary plans in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants for the primary plans 

the company made contributions of 26 million 26 million and 9 million to its funded pension plans in fiscal 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the 

  

company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2017 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 24 million in fiscal 2018 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant 

 

 recent accounting pronouncements 

see note 2—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

  

 the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency rates 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk foreign operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 and 2016 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2017 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 32 million and 12 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 6 million and 04 million respectively on an annual basis 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 97 million as of june 30 2017 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately 10 million before tax any changes in fair value of the company’s common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed otherthantemporary 

  

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2017 or june 30 2016 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2017 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

news corporation 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

receivables net consist of

prepublication costs 

the company capitalizes the art prepress outside editorial digital conversion and other costs incurred in the creation of the master copy of a book or other media the “prepublication costs” prepublication costs are amortized from the year of publication over the estimated useful life of the title using the straightline method for capitalized costs with an estimated useful life of one year or less and sum of the years’ digits for capitalized costs with an estimated useful life exceeding one year the company regularly reviews the recoverability of the capitalized costs based on expected future revenues prepublications costs are included in other noncurrent assets on the balance sheets and were 31 million and 33 million as of june 30 2017 and 2016 respectively amortization of prepublication costs for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 2016 and 2015 was 45 million 43 million and 43 million respectively

investments in which the company has no significant influence generally less than a 20 ownership interest or does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are designated as availableforsale investments if readily determinable market values are available the company reports availableforsale investments at fair value based on quoted market prices unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale investments are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss net of applicable taxes and other adjustments until the investment is sold or considered impaired if an investment’s fair value is not readily determinable the company accounts for its investment at cost 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of 3 to 50 years leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their useful lives or the life of the lease costs associated with the repair and maintenance of property plant and equipment are expensed as incurred changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to the company’s business model or capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from the company’s estimates in those cases where the company determines that the useful life of buildings and equipment should be changed the company would depreciate the asset over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation expense

royalty advances and it tracks each advance earned with respect to the sale of the related publication historically the longer the unearned portion of the advance remains outstanding the less likely it is that the company will recover the advance through the sale of the publication the company applies this historical experience to its existing outstanding royalty advances to estimate the likelihood of recovery and a provision is established to writeoff the unearned advance usually between 6 and 12 months after publication additionally the company reviews its portfolio of royalty advances for unpublished titles to determine if individual royalty advances are not recoverable for discrete reasons such as the death of an author prior to completion of a title or titles a company decision to not publish a title poor market demand or other relevant factors that could impact recoverability based on this information the portion of any advance that the company believes is not recoverable is expensed

under asu 201704 in assessing goodwill for impairment the company has the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the company is not required to perform any additional tests in assessing goodwill for impairment however if the company concludes otherwise or elects not to perform the qualitative assessment then it is required to perform a quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the business and compare the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if through a quantitative analysis the company determines the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount the goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired if the company concludes that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value an impairment will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value

uncertain tax positions 

the following table sets forth the change in the company’s unrecognized tax benefits excluding interest and penalties 

 

 the company recognizes interest and penalty charges related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense which is consistent with the recognition in prior reporting periods the company recognized interest and penalty charges of 11 million and 6 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 and june 30 2015 respectively and a benefit related to interest and penalties of 1 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 the company recorded liabilities for accrued interest and penalties of approximately 3 million 6 million and 8 million as of june 30 2017 2016 and 2015 respectively 

in fiscal year ended june 30 2017 the company reached an agreement with a foreign tax authority to settle certain tax issues related to fiscal years 2010 through 2015 as a result of the settlement the company recorded net income tax expense including interest and penalties of 63 million comprised of a current tax expense of 20 million and a deferred tax expense of 43 million 

the company’s tax returns are subject to ongoing review and examination by various tax authorities tax authorities may not agree with the treatment of items reported in our tax returns and therefore the outcome of tax reviews and examinations can be unpredictable the company is currently undergoing tax examinations in several states and foreign jurisdictions the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of uncertain tax matters and believes such liabilities represent a reasonable provision for taxes 

  

news corporation 

notes to the consolidated financial statements 

 

ultimately expected to be paid however the company may need to accrue additional income tax expense and our liability may need to be adjusted as new information becomes known and as these tax examinations continue to progress or as settlements or litigations occur 

the following is a summary of major tax jurisdictions for which tax authorities may assert additional taxes based upon tax years currently under audit and subsequent years that could be audited by the respective taxing authorities 

 

 it is reasonably possible that uncertain tax positions may increase or decrease in the next fiscal year however actual developments in this area could differ from those currently expected as of june 30 2017 approximately 34 million would affect the company’s effective income tax rate if and when recognized in future fiscal years it is reasonably possible the amount of uncertain tax liabilities which may be resolved within the next fiscal year is between the range of approximately nil and 19 million a portion of which will affect our effective income tax rate primarily as a result of the settlement of tax examinations and the lapsing of statutes of limitations 

other 

the company has not provided for us taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are considered to be reinvested indefinitely calculation of the unrecognized deferred tax liability for temporary differences related to these earnings is not practicable undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries considered to be indefinitely reinvested amounted to approximately 24 billion as of june 30 2017 the amount of undistributed earnings reflects adjustments related to the separation from 21st century fox that were finalized with the filing of our income tax returns in periods after the separation 

during the fiscal years ended june 30 2017 2016 and 2015 the company paid gross income taxes of 132 million 103 million and 134 million respectively and received income tax refunds of 9 million 10 million and 8 million respectively

governmental regulation 

general 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world the company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and 

  

regulations described herein the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on the company’s interests 

australian media regulation 

the company’s subscription television interests are subject to australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority 

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50 of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters and b the broadcasting services act also may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including for example preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area 

data privacy and security 

our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us certain of the company’s websites mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent in addition the federal trade commission the “ftc” continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements most states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union and australia recently the european union adopted the general data protection regulation “gdpr” which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the european union and to replace the existing data protection directive directive 9546ec fully enforceable by may 25 2018 the gdpr expands the regulation of the collection processing use and security of personal data contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects strengthens the rights of individuals including the right to have personal data deleted upon request continues to restrict the transborder flow of such data requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification increases penalties for noncompliance and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities also in 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the useu safe harbor framework one of the legal mechanisms through which personal data could be transferred from the european union to the united states and the mechanism relied upon by the company with respect to certain personal data transfers among the company’s businesses and between the company and some of its third party service providers the company has been putting into place and working with its third party service providers to implement alternative legal mechanisms for crossborder personal data transfers in australia data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers and placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

  

in response to such developments industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior the company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments including any changes required in the company’s data privacy and security compliance programs 

uk press regulation 

as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid2011 a royal charter on selfregulation of the press was granted in 2013 which established a recognition panel responsible for approving overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies once approved by the recognition panel the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers no such regulator has yet been approved by the recognition panel although it is currently considering an application by a newlyformed independent body impress in addition to the royal charter and establishment of the new recognition panel legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who do not participate in this new uk press regulatory system may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded 

in late 2013 publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead which is referred to as the independent press standards organisation or ipso ipso which began operating in september 2014 currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the editors’ code and levy fines of up to £1 million ipso is also considering the introduction of an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications ipso imposes burdens on the print media including the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance 

intellectual property 

the company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in newspapers books television programming and other content and technologies trademarks in names and logos trade names domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights in addition its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products business methods andor services none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations the company derives value and revenue from these assets through among other things print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales the sale distribution andor licensing of print and digital books the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution andor licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services 

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and 

  

international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement 

raw materials

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks or other risks or uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups risks related to the company’s business risks related to the company’s separation from 21st century fox and risks related to the company’s common stock 

risks related to the company’s business 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers integrated marketing services and digital media properties the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and paytv programming expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns national and local economic conditions particularly in major metropolitan markets affect the levels of retail national and classified newspaper advertising revenue changes in gross domestic product consumer spending housing sales auto sales unemployment rates and job creation all impact demand for advertising a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

  

the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company’s products and services demographics of the customer base advertising rates and results observed by advertisers for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties advertisers use various metrics to evaluate demand such as the number of visits number of users user engagement and for digital real estate services the number and quality of leads provided demand for the company’s products and services depends in turn upon the company’s ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner technological and other developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers 

the increasing popularity of digital media among consumers as a source of news and other content is driving a corresponding shift in advertising from traditional print to digital the development of new devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising in addition in the past rates have been generally lower for mobile advertising than for desktop advertising as a result increasing consumer reliance on mobile devices may add additional pricing pressure consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption 

the digital advertising market also continues to undergo significant changes that may further impact digital advertising revenues digital advertising networks and exchanges realtime bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers in addition evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising including the industrywide standard on viewability as well as the development and adoption of technology designed to block the display of advertising on websites and mobile devices may also negatively impact digital advertising revenues as the digital advertising market continues to evolve the company’s ability to compete successfully for advertising budgets will depend on among other things its ability to drive scale engage digital audiences and prove the value of its advertising and the effectiveness of the company’s platforms to its advertising customers including through more targeted datadriven offerings 

while the company has adopted a number of strategies and initiatives to address these challenges there can be no guarantee that its efforts will be successful if the company is unable to demonstrate the continuing value of its print and digital platforms and highquality content and brands or offer advertisers unique multiplatform advertising programs its results may suffer a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers reduced demand for the company’s offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content including both traditional and new content providers this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting general 

  

trends in the newspaper industry such as declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers’ increasing reliance on a variety of content providers including news aggregation websites and customized news feeds for the delivery of news and information through the internet often without charge internet sites and mobile applications devoted to recruitment automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company’s newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales in addition due to innovations in content distribution platforms consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content on television sets and mobile devices in some cases also without charge which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates’ television programming and paytv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company 

the company’s ability to compete effectively depends upon its ability to differentiate and distinguish its products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors which in turn depends on many factors both within and beyond its control for example the company relies on audience acceptance of the highquality content in its newspapers book titles cable channels and paytv programming in order to retain and grow their audiences similarly the success of the company’s digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors which the company generally obtains through shortterm arrangements with mlss real estate brokers real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed andor may be terminated with limited or no notice online traffic is also driven by internet search results and any failure to successfully manage and adapt to changes in search engine optimization across the company’s businesses could result in significant decreases in traffic to our digital properties lower advertiser interest in those properties and increased costs if free traffic is replaced with paid traffic 

some of the company’s current and potential competitors may have greater resources or better competitive positions in certain areas than it does which may allow them to respond more effectively to new technologies and changes in market conditions if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render the company’s products and services less valuable for example alternative methods for the delivery storage and consumption of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where and how they consume digital content content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet often without charge and consumers are able to view such internetdelivered content on portable devices and televisions enhanced internet capabilities and the development of new media channels may continue to reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership which could negatively affect the company’s revenues 

other digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with us often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internetbased products and services additional digital distribution channels such as the internet and online retailers have presented and may continue to present challenges to the company’s businesses including its traditional book publishing model which could adversely affect sales volume andor pricing 

  

in order to succeed the company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in order to respond to new technologies new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive including distribution of its content on a “pay” basis may not be adopted by consumers the company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technologies products services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer audience andor user base to decline in some cases precipitously and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses asset values and results of operations 

the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company’s australian operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period and programming costs could also increase upon renewal 

the sports rights contracts between certain of the company’s australian operating businesses on the one hand and various professional sports leagues and teams on the other have varying duration and renewal terms as these contracts expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought however third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts in addition professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and lead to customer dissatisfaction or in some cases loss of customers which could in turn adversely affect its revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings which could in turn have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone periods of economic uncertainty which resulted in among other things a general tightening in the credit markets limited access to the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition and liquidity including advertising revenues any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company’s business reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers books digital real estate services business television operations and other consumer products and services in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets as a result the company’s results of operations may 

  

be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market the company also has significant operations in the uk which recently voted in a referendum to leave the european union while the referendum is advisory the uk government has stated that it intends to give effect to the results of the vote an exit of the uk from the european union could significantly affect the fiscal monetary and regulatory landscape in the uk lead other member countries to consider leaving the european union result in additional volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets and have an adverse impact on the company’s businesses in the uk and elsewhere although the company believes that its capitalization operating cash flow and current access to credit markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions and investments that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 4 with respect to investments risks associated with the inability to control the operations of the business 5 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 6 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 7 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 8 potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business or investment and 9 in some cases increased regulation 

if any acquired business or investment fails to operate as anticipated or an acquired business cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing businesses the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and the company may be required to record noncash impairment charges for the writedown of certain acquired assets

the company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of foxtel while the company’s rights include the right to appoint onehalf of the board of directors of foxtel the company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf including with regards to declaring and paying dividends 

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s network management are important to its business activities the company also relies on third party providers for certain technology and “cloudbased” systems and services that support a variety of business operations network and information systemsrelated events affecting the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which the company’s business relies such as computer hackings computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing as well as power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities human error or malfeasance that may affect such 

  

systems could result in disruption of the company’s business andor loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information in addition hardware or software applications the company develops or procures from third parties may contain design or manufacturing defects that could unexpectedly compromise information security in recent years there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and such attacks have become more sophisticated targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against as a result the risks associated with such an event continue to increase the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date efforts by the company and its vendors to develop implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated while the company maintains cyber risk insurance this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our system 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems or those of third parties upon which its business relies could result in a disruption of its operations customer or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations and enforcement actions lawsuits remediation costs a loss of customers or revenues and other financial losses if any such failure interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal credit card confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of adverse developments in the company’s industry and challenging economic and market conditions the company may recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill intangible assets investments and other longlived assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s financial results when the company acquires a business it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities including intangible assets as of the acquisition date the company’s management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company’s cash flows in order to determine whether based on projected discounted future cash flows the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including distribution networks newspaper mastheads imprints and trademarks during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations the news and information services and cable network programming segments have reporting units with goodwill that is at risk for future impairment as of june 30 2016 nearly 10 billion of goodwill at these reporting units was at risk for future impairment because the fair values of the reporting units exceeded their carrying values by less than 10 the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

  

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests 

for example the company’s australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy regulation or legislation or the application or enforcement thereof applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general this includes 

 

  

  

  

  

 the company’s business activities are also subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed these laws and regulations could be costly to comply with limit or restrict aspects of the company’s business including for example by restricting the use of personal and profiling data to deliver targeted advertisements and subject the company to claims and other remedies for example the european union recently adopted the gdpr which expands the regulation of personal data processing throughout the european union and significantly increases penalties for noncompliance see “governmental regulation—data privacy and security” for more information 

in addition the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid2011 the uk government subsequently published a royal charter on selfregulation of the press which established a recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press selfregulatory body no such regulator has yet been approved by the recognition panel although it is currently considering an application by a newlyformed independent body impress in the meantime a majority of the uk press has established an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso which began operating in september 2014 ipso which has indicated that it does not intend to seek approval by the recognition panel has powers to impose burdens on the print media in the uk including the company’s ukbased newspaper businesses these powers which include the ability to impose fines of up to £1 million for breaches of ipso’s editor’s code of practice may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance 

  

adverse results from litigation or other proceedings could impact the company’s business practices and operating results 

from time to time the company is party to litigation as well as to regulatory and other proceedings with governmental authorities and administrative agencies for example a competitor of the company’s nam business has filed lawsuits against nam alleging antitrust violations and seeking treble damages injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees the outcome of these matters and other litigation and proceedings is subject to significant uncertainty and it is possible that an adverse resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in reputational harm andor significant monetary damages injunctive relief or settlement costs that could adversely affect the company’s results of operations or financial condition as well as the company’s ability to conduct its business as it is presently being conducted for example in february 2016 as part of a settlement agreement relating to an action brought by customers of the nam business the company agreed subject to district court approval to pay the plaintiffs and their attorneys approximately 250 million and settled related claims for approximately 30 million in addition regardless of merit or outcome such proceedings can have an adverse impact on the company as a result of legal costs diversion of management and other personnel and other factors see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 15 to the financial statements for more information 

newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control 

newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company’s newspaper publishing units during the three months ended june 30 2016 the company’s average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 16 lower than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years on a constant currency basis the price of newsprint has historically been volatile and the consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers which has led to increases in newsprint prices failure to maintain the company’s current consumption levels further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain the company’s existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future 

the company’s international operations expose it to additional risks that could adversely affect its business operating results and financial condition 

in its fiscal year ended june 30 2016 approximately 54 of the company’s revenues were derived outside the us and the company is focused on expanding the international scope of its operations there are risks inherent in doing business internationally including 1 issues related to managing international operations 2 economic uncertainty and volatility in local markets and political or social instability 3 potentially adverse changes in tax laws and regulations 4 complying with international laws and regulations including foreign ownership restrictions and data privacy requirements 5 complying with anticorruption laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 6 restrictions on repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange and 7 complying with local labor laws and regulations events or developments related to these and other risks associated with the company’s international operations could result in reputational harm and have an adverse impact on the company’s business financial condition operating results and prospects challenges associated with operating globally may increase as the company continues to expand into geographic areas that it believes represent the highest growth opportunities 

there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

from time to time the company may need or desire to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place including the company’s revolving credit facility will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions the company’s access to and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including but not limited to 1 the company’s financial performance 2 the company’s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating 3 the liquidity of the overall capital markets and 4 the state of the economy there can be no assurance particularly as a company that currently has no credit rating that the company will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

  

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights 

the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy however policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material the company has taken and will continue to take a variety of actions to combat piracy both individually and in some instances together with industry associations however protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed the company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy 

the company’s business relies on certain intellectual property and brands 

the company’s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks trade names copyrights patents and other proprietary rights as well as contractual arrangements including licenses to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names the company believes its proprietary trademarks trade names copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position however the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties any failure by the company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition in addition the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims 

the company’s relationship with nar is an important part of its digital real estate services business in the us and this business could be harmed if it were to lose the benefits of this relationship  

move the company’s digital real estate services business in the us licenses the realtorcom ® trademark and website address as well as the realtor ® trademark from nar pursuant to a trademark license agreement the “nar license” move also operates the realtorcom ® website under an agreement with nar that is perpetual in duration however nar may terminate the operating agreement for certain contractuallyspecified reasons upon expiration of applicable cure periods if the operating agreement with nar is terminated the nar license would also terminate and move would be required to transfer a copy of the software that operates the realtorcom ® website to nar and provide nar with copies of its agreements with advertisers and data content providers nar would then be able to operate a realtorcom ® website either by itself or with another third party 

in addition to the contractual limitations and risks described above any adverse developments in move’s business relationship with nar as a result of existing or new areas of conflict or potential conflict between move’s interests and nar’s interests changes in the real estate industry or other causes could also adversely affect move’s business particularly as many of its customers and data providers are members of have interests that are closely aligned with or are otherwise influenced by nar 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

in a variety of the company’s businesses it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins 

  

risks related to the company’s separation from 21st century fox 

if the separation together with certain related transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable transactions for us federal andor other jurisdictions’ income tax purposes then the company 21st century fox and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability and the company may be required to indemnify 21st century fox for taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox 

in connection with the separation 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service “irs” to the effect that among other things the distribution of the company’s class a common stock and class b common stock qualified as taxfree under sections 368 and 355 of the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the “code” except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares in addition 21st century fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the taxfree status of the separation for us federal income tax purposes including the satisfaction of the requirements under sections 368 and 355 of the code not specifically addressed in the irs private letter ruling the opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position 

the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs andor other tax authorities could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and us stockholders and certain nonus stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition if the internal reorganization andor the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable 21st century fox andor the company would recognize gains on the internal reorganization and 21st century fox would recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company’s common stock distributed to 21st century fox’s stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox’s tax basis in such shares as described below the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing 

under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation the company will in certain circumstances be responsible for all taxes including interest and penalties and taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation specifically in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken or omitted to be taken after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions 1 were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel 2 violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement or 3 the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected after consultation with its advisors could result in any such determination the company will be responsible for any taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination 

the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox 

each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group which prior to the separation included 21st century fox the company and 21st century fox’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the separation consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any member of 21st century fox’s consolidated group the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

  

the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the us 

the federal communications commission “fcc” has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations television broadcast networks and newspapers the “broadcast ownership rules” and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest the “program access rules” under the fcc’s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above the murdoch family trust’s ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company’s businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules consequently the company’s future conduct including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company’s acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator may affect 21st century fox’s ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules therefore the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires after the distribution date newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business then the company will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules in addition the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor including a cable television operator if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business 

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century fox for certain liabilities as a result the company could be required under certain circumstances to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates’ representations covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement tax sharing and indemnification agreement or any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company’s ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities 

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox and certain of the company’s officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of 21st century fox which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of 21st century fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox and lachlan k murdoch who serves as the company’s cochairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox for example potential conflicts of interest could 

  

arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to 21st century fox instead of the company as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation the provisions in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company 

risks related to the company’s common stock 

the market price of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 12 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders and 13 overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions 

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws tax sharing and indemnification agreement separation and distribution agreement and delaware law the company’s second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

 

  

   

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 and again in june 2015 pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2018 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 5 2016 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 5 2016 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 5 2016 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation 

free cash flow available to news corporation is a nongaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations less capital expenditures “free cash flow” less rea group free cash flow plus cash dividends received from rea group free cash flow available to news corporation excludes cash flows from discontinued operations free cash flow should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for cash flows from continuing operations and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since companies and investors may differ as to what items should be included in the calculation of free cash flow 

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures which can then be used for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions strengthening the company’s balance sheet dividend payouts and repurchasing stock a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or 

  

decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporate all cash movements during the period 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by continuing operating activities to free cash flow available to news corporation 

 

 free cash flow available to news corporation increased by 15 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 to 610 million from 595 million in fiscal 2015 the improvement was primarily due lower capital expenditures due to the absence of costs associated with the relocation of the company’s operations to a new site in london in fiscal 2015 partially offset by lower cash provided by operating activities as discussed above the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against local currencies resulted in a decrease of free cash flow available to news corporation of approximately 48 million or 8 for fiscal 2016 

free cash flow available to news corporation in fiscal 2015 of 595 million increased from 561 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to lower capital expenditures as well as higher dividends received from rea and lower rea group cash flow which is excluded from free cash flow available to news corporation partially offset by lower cash provided by operating activities discussed above 

revolving credit facility 

the company’s credit agreement as amended the “credit agreement” provides for an unsecured 650 million revolving credit facility the “facility” that can be used for general corporate purposes the facility has a sublimit of 100 million available for issuances of letters of credit under the credit agreement the company may request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of 900 million 

in october 2015 the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement the “amendment” which among other things extended the original term of the facility by two years and lowered the commitment fee payable by the company as a result of the amendment the lenders’ commitments now terminate on october 23 2020 and any borrowings will be due at that time the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement for up to two additional oneyear periods 

the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default with customary exceptions including limitations on the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to engage in transactions with affiliates incur liens merge into or consolidate with any other entity incur subsidiary debt or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or all or substantially all of the stock of its subsidiaries in addition the credit agreement requires the company to maintain an adjusted operating income leverage ratio of not more than 30 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 30 to 10 if any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived any unpaid amounts under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable as of june 30 2016 the company was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants 

  

interest on borrowings under the facility is based on either a a eurodollar rate formula or b the base rate formula each as set forth in the credit agreement the applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the pricing grid in the credit agreement which varies based on the company’s adjusted operating income leverage ratio as of june 30 2016 the company was paying a commitment fee of 0225 on any undrawn balance and an applicable margin of 050 for a base rate borrowing and 150 for a eurodollar rate borrowing 

as of the date of this filing the company has not borrowed any funds under the facility 

rea group unsecured revolving loan facility 

rea group entered into a a480 million unsecured syndicated revolving loan facility agreement in connection with the acquisition of iproperty the rea facility consists of three sub facilities of a120 million a120 million and a240 million which become due in december 2017 december 2018 and december 2019 respectively in february 2016 rea group drew down the full a480 million approximately 340 million as of such date available under the rea facility and the proceeds less lenders’ fees of 1 million were used to fund the iproperty acquisition borrowings under the rea facility bear interest at a floating rate of the australian bbsy plus a margin in the range of 085 and 145 depending on rea group’s net leverage ratio as of june 30 2016 rea group was paying a margin of between 100 and 120 rea group paid approximately 4 million in interest for the fiscal year ended june 30 2016 at a weighted average interest rate of 32 the rea facility requires rea group to maintain a net leverage ratio of not more than 325 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 30 to 10 as of june 30 2016 rea group was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants 

commitments 

the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements “firm commitments” to make future payments these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations the following table summarizes the company’s material firm commitments as of june 30 2016 

 

  

    

 the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements for production since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

the table also excludes the company’s pension obligations other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 26 million and 9 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 25 million in fiscal 2017 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2016 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 10 million in fiscal 2017 see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

contingencies 

the company routinely is involved in various legal proceedings claims and governmental inspections or investigations including those discussed below the outcome of these matters and claims is subject to significant uncertainty and the company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of pending matters will be or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters fees expenses fines penalties judgments or settlement costs which might be incurred by the company in connection with the various proceedings could adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims when it determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated once established accruals are adjusted from time to time as appropriate in light of additional information the amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters legal fees associated with litigation and similar proceedings are expensed as incurred the company recognizes gain contingencies when the gain becomes realized or realizable see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company’s operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course it is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition future results of operations or liquidity as subsidiaries of 21st century fox prior to the separation the company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st century fox for the consolidated us federal income taxes of the 21st century fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the company or any of the company’s domestic subsidiaries are or were a member of the 21st century fox consolidated group consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the 21st century fox consolidated group in conjunction with the separation the company entered into the tax sharing and indemnification agreement with 21st century fox 

  

the “tax sharing and indemnification agreement” which requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the internal revenue service “irs” or other taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including goodwill newspaper mastheads trade names distribution networks publishing rights copyrighted products trademarks and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

the valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

  

the company determined that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included in the balance sheets were not impaired for the company’s reporting units significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method for these reporting units were discount rates ranging from 9145 longterm growth rates ranging from 035 and royalty rates ranging from 0534 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation methods were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 1015 

significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

the fair values of the company’s reporting units in fiscal 2016 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 8 to 18 consequently no impairments were identified an approximate 400 basis point increase in the discount rate or an approximate 700 basis point decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment and the cable network programming segment failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis the goodwill at risk associated with these reporting units is nearly 1 billion as of june 30 2016 the company will continue to monitor its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

in fiscal 2016 given the decline in operating performance at certain reporting units the company performed an analysis over fixed to determine if such assets continue to be recoverable as a result of the analysis the company determined that the fixed assets reviewed as part of the analysis continue to be recoverable 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws 

  

are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers historical results and estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning the outcome of tax audits and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax benefit expense 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its pension and other postretirement benefit plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit costs income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the expected longterm rate of return is based on a direct asset allocation assumption of 26 equities 62 fixedincome securities and 12 cash and other investments total net periodic benefit costs income for the plans were 8 million 4 million and 7 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively 

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds for fiscal 2016 and the prior periods presented the company estimated the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs income utilizing a single weightedaverage discount rate for each country in which the company has plans derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation 

  

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 net periodic benefit costs income for its plans consist of the following 

 

 the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk and australia as of the measurement date beginning in fiscal 2017 the company will change the method used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost income for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans the new method utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows the company will change to the new method to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and their corresponding spot rates the change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate which is applied prospectively although the discount rate used for each plan will be established and applied individually a weighted average discount rate of 31 will be used in calculating the fiscal 2017 net periodic benefit costs income this change in estimate is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s pension and postretirement net periodic benefit expense in future periods 

the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 57 for fiscal 2017 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and historical experience of actual plan returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2016 were approximately 610 million which increased from approximately 570 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2015 this increase of 40 million was primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate across all plans and utilized in measuring the company’s domestic and international pension obligations lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs income in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants 

the company made contributions of 26 million 9 million and 137 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively in fiscal 2014 approximately 37 million of the contributions were made by a third party in connection with the sale of a business in a prior period on behalf of former employees who retained certain pension benefits future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2016 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 25 million in fiscal 2017 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency rates 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk foreign operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2016 and 2015 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2016 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 32 million and 11 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 7 million and 04 million respectively on an annual basis 

stock prices

governmental regulation 

general 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world the company believes that it is in material compliance with the requirements imposed by those laws and regulations described herein the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on the company’s interests 

australian media regulation 

the company’s subscription television interests are subject to australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority 

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50 of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters and b the broadcasting services act also may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including for example preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area 

uk press regulation 

on july 13 2011 prime minister david cameron announced a twopart inquiry into the uk press and appointed lord justice leveson as chairman of the inquiry the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company’s former publication the news of the world  hearings opened on 

  

november 14 2011 with respect to the first part of the inquiry and lord justice leveson published his report on november 29 2012 the report made recommendations on the future of press regulation and governance in the uk which have been the subject of debate in the uk parliament as well as discussion both among newspaper groups including news uk and the industry and the government a date has yet to be set for the second part of the inquiry 

in 2013 a royal charter on selfregulation of the press was granted which established a recognition panel responsible for recognizing overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies the panel is currently determining how it will receive and approve applications from bodies applying to become a press regulatory body and intends to start accepting applications later in 2015 the new press regulatory body or bodies a majority of the board members of which would be independent of the industry would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers the uk government also passed legislation which ensures that the royal charter can only be altered by a twothirds majority of parliament in addition to the royal charter and establishment of a new regulatory body legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who do not participate in this new uk press regulatory system may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded 

in late 2013 publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead which is referred to as the independent press standards organisation or ipso since then ipso has been established and began operating in september 2014 ipso currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the recognition panel ipso has an independent chairman and a 12member board the majority of which are independent ipso oversees the editors’ code of practice requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires selfreporting of any failures provides a complaints handling service has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code and levy fines ipso is also considering the introduction of an arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications ipso imposes burdens on the print media including the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance 

data privacy and security 

our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve in light of changes in information technology and analytics techniques that have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us the company’s websites mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent and the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act of 2003 which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails or “spam” the state of california also recently enacted a number of laws relating to data privacy and security including the “digital eraser” law which regulates online advertising to minors in addition regulators such as the federal communications commission and the federal trade commission the “ftc” continue to expand their application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements the ftc also continues to expand its enforcement of the telephone consumer protection act which regulates text message advertising many states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union and australia the european union is currently considering a new privacy regulation that would replace its existing data protection directive and if adopted in its current proposed form would expand the regulation of the collection use and security of personal data continue to 

  

restrict the transborder flow of such data introduce an expanded right of individuals to have their data deleted upon request enhance penalties for noncompliance and increase the enforcement powers of the european commission in australia recent changes in data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers and placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

in response to such developments industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior in the us the council on better business bureaus has begun enforcing the digital advertising alliance’s selfregulatory principles for online behavioral advertising with respect to native advertising requiring realtime notice and an opportunity to opt out in connection with such advertisements 

the company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments 

education 

the availability of funding for k12 education is affected by changes in legislation both at the federal and state level as well as changes in the state procurement process future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment leading to budget issues and resulting decreases in educational funding that could in turn have an adverse impact on the company’s digital education business 

intellectual property 

the company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in newspapers books television programming and other content and technologies trademarks in names and logos trade names domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights in addition its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products business methods andor services none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations the company derives value and revenue from these assets through among other things print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales the sale distribution andor licensing of print and digital books the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution andor licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services 

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their 

  

validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement 

raw materials

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form 10k in evaluating the company and its common stock any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups risks related to the company’s business risks related to the company’s separation from 21st century fox and risks related to the company’s common stock 

risks related to the company’s business 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising through its newspapers integrated marketing services and digital media properties the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and paytv programming expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns national and local economic conditions particularly in major metropolitan markets affect the levels of retail national and classified newspaper advertising revenue changes in gross domestic product consumer spending housing sales auto sales unemployment rates and job creation all impact demand for advertising a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company’s products and services demographics of the customer base advertising rates and results observed by advertisers for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates for the company’s digital media properties advertisers use various 

  

metrics to evaluate demand such as the number of visits number of users user engagement and for digital real estate services the number and quality of leads provided demand for the company’s products and services depends in turn upon the company’s ability to differentiate and distinguish those products and services and anticipate and adapt to changes in consumer tastes and behaviors in a timely manner for example the company’s newspapers cable channels and paytv programming must continue to provide highquality content that is interesting and relevant to users in order to retain and grow their audiences similarly the success of the company’s digital real estate services business depends in part on providing more comprehensive current and accurate real estate listing data than its competitors which the company generally obtains through shortterm arrangements with mlss real estate brokers real estate agents and other third parties that may not be renewed andor may be terminated with limited or no notice 

in addition streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet and other devices and technologies as well as higher consumer engagement with other forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising new delivery platforms may also lead to loss of distribution and pricing control and loss of a direct relationship with consumers these technological and other developments may also cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers furthermore the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising digital advertising networks and exchanges realtime bidding and other programmatic buying channels that allow advertisers to buy audiences at scale are also playing a more significant role in the advertising marketplace and may cause further downward pricing pressure evolving standards for the delivery of digital advertising such as viewability could also adversely affect digital advertising revenues consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers reduced demand for the company’s offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content 

the company’s businesses face significant competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content including both traditional and new content providers this competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of new digital and other technologies and platforms and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry including declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers’ increasing reliance on the internet for the delivery of news and information often without charge in recent years internet sites devoted to recruitment automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company’s newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales in addition due to innovations in content distribution platforms consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content on television sets and mobile devices in some cases also without charge which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates’ television programming and paytv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company the company’s ability to compete effectively depends on many factors both within and beyond its control including audience acceptance of its highquality journalism book titles television programming and other products if the company is unable to compete successfully against existing or future competitors its business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and continue to innovate and provide useful products in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly and the resulting changes in consumer behavior and preferences create constant opportunities for new and existing competitors that can quickly render our products and services less valuable for example alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where and how they consume digital content content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet often without charge and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internetdelivered content on portable devices and televisions enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership which could negatively affect the company’s revenues 

new digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the effort and expense of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing digital content providers customers suppliers and other third parties to compete with us often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content and result in relatively low barriers to entry for competing internetbased products and services in addition new digital distribution channels such as the internet and online retailers may present both challenges and opportunities to the company’s businesses including its traditional book publishing model which could affect both sales volume and pricing 

in order to succeed the company must continue to innovate to ensure that its products and services remain relevant and useful for consumers and customers the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in order to respond to new technologies new and enhanced offerings from its competitors and changes in consumer behavior and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive including distribution of its content on a “pay” basis may not be adopted by consumers the company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technologies products services and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could cause its customer audience andor user base to decline in some cases precipitously and could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses asset values and results of operations 

the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company’s australian operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period 

the sports rights contracts between certain of the company’s australian operating businesses on the one hand and various professional sports leagues and teams on the other have varying duration and renewal terms as these contracts expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought however third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts in addition professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and could adversely affect its revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling since the company’s financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have a currency translation impact on the company’s earnings which could in turn have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

  

weak domestic and global economic conditions and volatility and disruption in the financial and other markets may adversely affect the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone economic uncertainty in the past which resulted in among other things a general tightening in the credit markets limited access to the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending lower consumer net worth and a dramatic decline in the real estate market the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and had an adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition and liquidity including advertising revenues any continued or recurring economic weakness could further impact the company’s business reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers books digital real estate services business television operations and other consumer products and services in addition further volatility and disruption in the financial markets could make it more difficult and expensive for the company to obtain financing these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company including as a result of their inability to obtain capital on acceptable terms the company is particularly exposed to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets as a result the company’s results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market although the company believes that its capitalization operating cash flow and current access to credit markets including the company’s revolving credit facility will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that any further volatility and disruption in domestic and global capital and credit markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing 

the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions that introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company has made and may continue to make strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 4 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 5 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 6 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 7 potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business and 8 in some cases increased regulation 

if any acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing business the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and the company may be required to record noncash impairment charges for the writedown of certain acquired assets 

the company does not have the right to manage foxtel which means it is not able to cause foxtel to operate or make corporate decisions in a manner that is favorable to the company 

the company does not have the right to manage the business or affairs of foxtel while the company’s rights include the right to appoint onehalf of the board of directors of foxtel the company is not able to cause management or the board of directors to take any specific actions on its behalf including with regards to declaring and paying dividends 

  

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s network management are important to its business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing as well as power outages equipment failure natural disasters including extreme weather terrorist activities or human error that may affect such systems could result in disruption of the company’s services andor loss or improper disclosure of personal data business information including intellectual property or other confidential information in recent years there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks on companies’ network and information systems and as a result the risks associated with such an event continue to increase the company has experienced and expects to continue to be subject to cybersecurity threats and incidents none of which have been material to the company to date 

a significant failure compromise breach or interruption of the company’s systems could result in a disruption of its operations customer or advertiser dissatisfaction damage to its reputation or brands regulatory investigations lawsuits a loss of customers or revenues and other financial losses if any such failure interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors including financial personal credit card confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel customers vendors and the company’s business including its intellectual property the company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy efforts by the company and its vendors to develop implement and maintain security measures may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring particularly given that techniques used to access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and any network and information systemsrelated events could require the company to expend significant resources to remedy such event moreover the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated 

the company faces investigations regarding allegations of voicemail interception illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials and other related matters and related civil lawsuits 

governmental authorities in the uk are conducting investigations relating to voicemail interception illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials at the company’s former publication the news of the world  and at the sun  and related matters which are referred to as the uk newspaper matters the company is cooperating with these investigations civil claims have also been brought against the company with respect to the uk newspaper matters the company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases the company has also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme established by the company under which parties could pursue claims against it while additional civil lawsuits may be filed no additional civil claims may be brought under the compensation scheme after april 8 2013 

in connection with the separation the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that 21st century fox will indemnify the company for payments made after the distribution date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the uk newspaper matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the criminal matters other than fees expenses and costs relating to employees 1 who are not directors officers or certain designated employees or 2 with respect to civil matters who are not codefendants with the company or 21st century fox in addition violations of law may result in criminal fines or penalties for which the company will not be indemnified by 21st century fox 21st century fox’s indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an aftertax basis 

  

from july 1 2010 through june 30 2015 the company incurred aggregate fees costs and expenses related to the uk newspaper matters of 520 million net of costs that have been or will be indemnified by 21st century fox which includes 39 million paid to claimants for civil settlements as of june 30 2015 the company accrued 125 million representing its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed including liabilities associated with employment taxes as well as incurred but unpaid legal and professional fees certain liabilities recorded by the company as of june 30 2015 related to matters that will be indemnified by 21st century fox as described above amounts due from 21st century fox relating to indemnified costs were approximately 63 million as of june 30 2015 

the company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims or criminal matters it is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea judgment or similar result for which the company will not be indemnified could damage its reputation impair the company’s ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information 

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of adverse developments in the company’s industry and challenging economic and market conditions the company may recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill and intangible assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s financial results when the company acquires a business it records goodwill in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities including intangible assets as of the acquisition date the company’s management must regularly evaluate goodwill and other acquired intangible assets expected to contribute indefinitely to the company’s cash flows in order to determine whether based on projected discounted future cash flows the carrying value for such assets exceeds current fair value and the company should recognize an impairment in accordance with gaap the company performs an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including newspaper mastheads and distribution networks during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and other longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units any downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as part of its longrange planning process the company changed its strategy and related outlook with respect to its amplify reporting unit which resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows consequently the company determined that the fair value of the amplify reporting unit had declined below its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of 371 million in the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests 

  

for example the company’s australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy regulation or legislation or the application or enforcement thereof applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general this includes 

 

  

  

  

  

 in addition the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk are subject to greater regulation and oversight as a result of the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid2011 the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company’s former publication the news of the world  lord justice leveson chairman of the inquiry concluded the first part of the inquiry and published a report in late november 2012 containing various recommendations for greater regulation and oversight of the uk press the uk government subsequently published a royal charter on selfregulation of the press which established a recognition panel responsible for approving and monitoring a new press selfregulatory body no such regulator has yet been approved by the recognition panel however a majority of the uk press has established an alternative regulator the independent press standards organisation or ipso which began operating in september 2014 ipso imposes burdens on the print media in the uk including the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk which may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance 

the company’s business activities are also subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve in light of changes in information technology and analytics techniques that have implications for how such data is managed see “governmental regulation—data privacy and security” for more information these laws and regulations could be costly to comply with subject the company to claims and other remedies and limit or restrict aspects of the company’s business including for example by restricting the use of personal and profiling data to deliver targeted advertisements

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights 

the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy however policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties developments in technology increase the threat of 

  

content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material the company has taken and will continue to take a variety of actions to combat piracy both individually and in some instances together with industry associations however protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed the company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy

the company’s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks trade names copyrights patents and other proprietary rights as well as contractual arrangements including licenses to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names the company believes its proprietary trademarks trade names copyrights patents and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position however the company cannot ensure that these intellectual property rights will be upheld if challenged or that these rights will protect the company against infringement claims by third parties any failure by the company to effectively protect its intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition in addition the company may be contractually required to indemnify other parties against liabilities arising out of any third party infringement claims

the company’s relationship with nar is an important part of its digital real estate services business in the us and this business could be harmed if it were to lose the benefits of this relationship

risks related to the company’s separation from 21st century fox 

if the separation together with certain related transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes then the company 21st century fox and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability and the company may be required to indemnify 21st century fox for taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox 

in connection with the separation 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that among other things the distribution of the company’s class a common stock and class b common stock qualified as taxfree under sections 368 and 355 of the code except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares in addition 21st century fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the taxfree status of the separation for us federal income tax purposes including the satisfaction of the requirements under sections 368 and 355 of the code not specifically addressed in the irs private letter ruling the opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position 

the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and us stockholders and certain nonus stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition if the internal reorganization andor the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable 21st century fox would recognize gains on the internal reorganization andor recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company’s common stock distributed to 21st century fox’s stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox’s tax basis in such shares as described below the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing 

under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation the company will in certain circumstances be responsible for all taxes including interest and penalties and taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation specifically in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken or omitted to be taken after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions 1 were inconsistent with any representation or covenant 

  

made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel 2 violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement or 3 the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected after consultation with its advisors could result in any such determination the company will be responsible for any taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination 

the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox 

each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group which prior to the separation included 21st century fox the company and 21st century fox’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the separation consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any member of 21st century fox’s consolidated group the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the us 

the federal communications commission “fcc” has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations television broadcast networks and newspapers the “broadcast ownership rules” and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest the “program access rules” under the fcc’s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above the murdoch family trust’s ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company’s businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules consequently the company’s future conduct including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company’s acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator may affect 21st century fox’s ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules therefore the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires after the distribution date newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business then the company will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules in addition the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor including a cable television operator if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business 

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century fox for certain liabilities as a result the company could be required under certain circumstances to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates’ representations covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement tax sharing and indemnification agreement or 

  

any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company’s ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities 

certain agreements that the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may limit its ability to take certain actions with respect to the civil uk newspaper matters 

under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement in consideration for 21st century fox’s agreement to certain indemnification arrangements the company agreed that 21st century fox would have the right to control the company’s defense of civil claims relating to the uk newspaper matters in exercising its rights to control the defense of the civil claims relating to the uk newspaper matters 21st century fox may be guided by interests that are different than or adverse to the company’s interests and the interests of its stockholders and advocate strategies that the company’s management would not otherwise adopt furthermore if the company fails to comply with these control arrangements or does not consent to settlements with respect to such matters proposed by 21st century fox the company has agreed with 21st century fox that it will at 21st century fox’s discretion forego any indemnification with regard to such or all of these matters the company’s inability to take actions with respect to these civil matters without 21st century fox’s consent or the company’s adoption of strategies advocated by 21st century fox could damage the company’s reputation or impair the company’s ability to conduct its business while the taking of any such action by the company without 21st century fox’s consent in breach of the company’s agreements could increase its liability exposure with regard to such matters and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information 

the company has a limited operating history as an independent publiclytraded company and its historical financial statements for certain reporting periods are not necessarily representative of the results it would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company do not reflect any subsequent changes in its cost structure and may not be reliable indicators of its future results 

certain of the company’s historical financial statements do not necessarily reflect the results of operations cash flows and financial condition that it would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company during the applicable period or those that it will achieve in the future prior to the separation the company’s business was operated by 21st century fox as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company during those periods 21st century fox performed various corporate functions for the company including but not limited to tax administration treasury activities accounting legal ethics and compliance program administration investor and public relations certain governance functions including internal audit and external reporting certain of the company’s historical financial statements reflect allocations of corporate expenses from 21st century fox for these and similar functions however these allocations may be more or less than the comparable expenses that the company would have incurred had it operated as an independent publicly traded company during those periods in addition changes have occurred and may continue to occur in the company’s cost structure management financing business operations personnel needs tax and structure as a result of its operation as a public company separate from 21st century fox including the incurrence of costs for compliance with requirements of the sarbanesoxley act sec regulations and nasdaq and asx listing rules and potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale prior to the separation the company benefited from 21st century fox’s operating diversity size purchasing power and access to capital for investments and it may not continue to realize such benefits in the future as a result there is a risk that the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while it was still a part of 21st century fox additionally in connection with the separation the company entered into certain transactions with 21st century fox that did not exist prior to the separation 

  

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox and certain of the company’s officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of 21st century fox which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of 21st century fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox and lachlan k murdoch who serves as the company’s cochairman and executive chairman of 21st century fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to 21st century fox instead of the company as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation the provisions in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company 

risks related to the company’s common stock 

the market price of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 12 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders and 13 overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions 

  

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws tax sharing and indemnification agreement separation and distribution agreement and delaware law the company’s second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 and again in june 2015 pursuant to the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2018 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 6 2015 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 6 2015 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 6 2015 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of 

  

the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the second amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

the separation and distribution 

on june 28 2013 the “distribution date” the company completed the separation of its businesses the “separation” from twentyfirst century fox inc “21st century fox” as of the effective time of the separation all of the outstanding shares of the company were distributed to 21st century fox stockholders based on a distribution ratio of one share of company class a or class b common stock for every four shares of 21st century fox class a or class b common stock respectively held of record as of june 21 2013 the “record date” following the separation the company’s class a and class b common stock began trading independently on the nasdaq global select market “nasdaq” and chess depositary interests representing the company’s class a and class b common stock began trading on the australian securities exchange “asx” in connection with the separation the company entered into the separation and distribution agreement the “separation and distribution agreement” and certain other related agreements which govern the company’s relationship with 21st century fox following the separation see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company’s financial statements as of and for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015 2014 and 2013 are presented on a consolidated basis the company’s consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015 and 2014 reflect the company’s operations as a standalone company the company’s consolidated balance sheets as of june 30 2015 and 2014 consist of the company’s consolidated balances subsequent to the separation 

prior to the separation the company’s combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21st century fox the company’s consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 included allocations of general 

  

corporate expenses for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by 21st century fox and not recorded at the business unit level such as expenses related to finance human resources information technology facilities and legal among others these expenses were allocated to the company on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of consolidated revenues operating income headcount or other measures of the company management believes the assumptions underlying these consolidated financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21st century fox were reasonable nevertheless these consolidated financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the company and may not reflect the company’s consolidated results of operations and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the applicable periods actual costs that would have been incurred if the company had been a standalone company for the full fiscal year would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure 

the consolidated financial statements are referred to as the “financial statements” herein the consolidated statements of operations are referred to as the “statements of operations” herein the consolidated balance sheets are referred to as the “balance sheets” herein the consolidated statements of cash flows are referred to as the “statements of cash flows” herein 

the financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” 

for purposes of the company’s financial statements for periods prior to the separation income tax expense was recorded as if the company filed tax returns on a standalone basis separate from 21st century fox this separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if the company was a standalone enterprise for the periods prior to the distribution date therefore cash tax payments for periods prior to the separation may not be reflective of the company’s actual tax balances prior to the separation the company’s operating results were included in 21st century fox’s consolidated us federal and state income tax returns the calculation of the company’s income taxes involves considerable judgment and the use of both estimates and allocations

 revenues — revenues increased 59 million or 1 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the revenue increase was primarily due to increased revenues at the book publishing segment of 233 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of harlequin in august 2014 and increased revenues at the digital real estate services segment of 217 million primarily as a result of the acquisition of move in november 2014 and to a lesser extent increased revenues at rea group these revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues at the news and information services segment of 422 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 primarily resulting from weakness in the print advertising market and the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations partially offset by an increase in other revenues 

operating expenses — operating expenses decreased 114 million or 2 for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the decrease in operating expenses was mainly due to lower operating expenses at the news and information services segment of 264 million due to lower production and distribution costs resulting from reduced sales the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of cost savings initiatives the decrease in operating expenses was partially offset by higher operating expenses at the book publishing and digital real estate services segments primarily due to the acquisitions of harlequin and move respectively the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating expense decrease of 143 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014

 net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 23 million for the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 the decrease was primarily due to the absence of the net receipts related to a foreign tax refund of 73 million and lease incentives of 35 million received during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 as well as higher net tax payments of 54 million and approximately 45 million of higher deferred payments related to the acquisition of wireless generation in the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 the decrease in the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 was partially offset by lower pension contributions of 92 million lower restructuring payments of 55 million and lower payments for fees and costs related to the uk newspaper matters of 31 million the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against local currencies resulted in an operating cash flow decrease of approximately 55 million or 6

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation 

free cash flow available to news corporation is a nongaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and rea group free cash flow plus cash dividends received from rea group 

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures which can then be used for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions strengthening the company’s balance sheet dividend payouts and repurchasing stock a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the company’s consolidated statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporates all cash movements during the period 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow available to news corporation 

 

 free cash flow available to news corporation improved by 3 million in fiscal 2015 to 368 million from 365 million in fiscal 2014 the improvement was primarily due to higher dividends received from rea and lower rea group free cash flow which is excluded from free cash flow available to news corp offset by lower cash provided by operating activities as discussed above the impact of foreign currency fluctuations of the us dollar against local currencies resulted in a decrease of free cash flow available to news corporation of approximately 30 million or 8 for fiscal 2015 

free cash flow available to news corporation in fiscal 2014 of 365 million increased from 72 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the changes in net cash provided by operating activities discussed above partially offset by increased capital expenditures 

revolving credit agreement 

the company’s credit agreement provides for an unsecured 650 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the “facility” that can be used for general corporate purposes the facility has a sublimit of 100 million available for issuances of letters of credit under the credit agreement the company may request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of 900 million subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement the company may borrow prepay and reborrow amounts under the facility during the term of the credit agreement all amounts under the credit agreement are due on october 23 2018 unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at the request of the company or if an event of default occurs by the designated agent at the request or with the consent of the lenders or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcyrelated events the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain 

  

circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement for up to two additional oneyear periods additionally interest on borrowings is based on either a a eurodollar rate formula or b the base rate formula each as set forth in the credit agreement 

the credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default with customary exceptions including limitations on the ability of the company and the company’s subsidiaries to engage in transactions with affiliates incur liens merge into or consolidate with any other entity incur subsidiary debt or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or all or substantially all of the stock of its subsidiaries taken as a whole in addition the credit agreement requires the company to maintain an adjusted operating income leverage ratio of not more than 30 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 30 to 10 if any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived any unpaid amounts under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable as of june 30 2015 the company was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants 

the applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the pricing grid in the credit agreement which varies based on the company’s adjusted operating income leverage ratio as of june 30 2015 the company is paying a commitment fee of 025 on any undrawn balance and an applicable margin of 050 for a base rate borrowing and 150 for a eurodollar rate borrowing 

as of the date of this filing the company has not borrowed any funds under the facility 

commitments 

the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements “firm commitments” to make future payments these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations the following table summarizes the company’s material firm commitments as of june 30 2015 

 

  

   the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

  

the table also excludes the company’s pension other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 9 million and 137 million to its pension plans in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively included within the total contributions for fiscal 2014 were contributions of approximately 37 million which were made by a third party in connection with the sale of a business in a prior period on behalf of former employees who retained certain pension benefits these contributions were a combination of required and voluntary contributions made to improve the funding status of the plans future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 25 million in fiscal 2016 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2015 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its opeb payments to approximate 10 million in fiscal 2016 see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension and opeb plans 

contingencies 

as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements governmental authorities in the uk continue to conduct investigations initiated in 2011 with respect to the uk newspaper matters the company is cooperating with these investigations 

civil claims have also been brought against the company with respect to the uk newspaper matters the company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases the company has also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme established by the company under which parties could pursue claims against it while additional civil lawsuits may be filed no additional civil claims may be brought under the compensation scheme after april 8 2013 

in connection with the separation the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that 21st century fox will indemnify the company for payments made after the distribution date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the uk newspaper matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the criminal matters other than fees expenses and costs relating to employees i who are not directors officers or certain designated employees or ii with respect to civil matters who are not codefendants with the company or 21st century fox in addition violations of law may result in criminal fines or penalties for which the company will not be indemnified by 21st century fox 21st century fox’s indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an aftertax basis 

as of june 30 2015 the company has provided for its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed and costs incurred including liabilities associated with employment taxes and has accrued approximately 125 million of which approximately 63 million will be indemnified by 21st century fox and a corresponding receivable was recorded in amounts due from 21st century fox on the balance sheet it is not possible to estimate the liability or corresponding receivable for any additional claims that may be filed given the information that is currently available to the company if more claims are filed and additional information becomes available the company will update the liability provision and corresponding receivable for such matters 

the company’s operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course it is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that 

  

the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition future results of operations or liquidity as subsidiaries of 21st century fox prior to the separation the company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st century fox for the consolidated us federal income taxes of the 21st century fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the company or any of the company’s domestic subsidiaries were a member of the 21st century fox consolidated group consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the 21st century fox consolidated group the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs or other taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the company’s summary of significant accounting policies 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including goodwill newspaper mastheads trade names distribution networks publishing rights copyrighted products trademarks and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced below their carrying value the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

the valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test 

with respect to its amplify reporting unit the company changed its strategy and related outlook which resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows for the business as a result the company determined 

  

that the fair value of this reporting unit declined below its carrying value and recorded a noncash impairment charge of 371 million with no associated tax impact in the fiscal year ended june 30 2015 the charge primarily consisted of a writedown of the company’s goodwill of 325 million and a writedown of capitalized software development costs of 45 million for the impaired reporting unit significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method were discount rates ranging from 1245 and longterm growth rates ranging from 04 

other than the impairment noted above the company determined that the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included in the balance sheets were not impaired for the remaining reporting units significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation method for these reporting units were discount rates ranging from 914 longterm growth rates ranging from 03 and royalty rates ranging from 0533 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation methods were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 1015 

significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

in fiscal 2015 other than with respect to the amplify reporting unit as discussed above the company determined that no events occurred or circumstances existed that required the company to test its fixed assets for impairment 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

  

the company’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax expense benefit 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries which are the direct obligations of the company “direct plans” in addition to the direct plans prior to the separation certain of the company’s employees participated in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by 21st century fox and as a result the statements of operations included expenses related to these shared plans including expenses related to the company’s employees as well as allocations of expenses related to corporate employees through the corporate expense allocations benefit costs related to employees’ participation in plans sponsored by 21st century fox did not recur in periods subsequent to the separation see note 1 and note 15 to the consolidated financial statements 

the company records amounts relating to its direct plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit income cost is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the expected longterm rate of return is based on a direct asset allocation assumption of 29 equities 55 fixedincome securities and 16 cash and other investments total net periodic benefit income costs for these direct plans were 4 million 7 million and 35 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively 

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for direct pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the direct plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds 

  

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 net periodic benefit income costs for its direct plans consist of the following 

 

 the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk and australia as of the measurement date the company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 39 in calculating the fiscal 2016 net periodic benefit costs the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 57 for fiscal 2016 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and historical experience of actual plan returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2015 were approximately 570 million which increased from approximately 528 million for the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2014 this increase of 42 million was primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate for the uk plans and strengthening of the mortality tables utilized in measuring the company’s domestic pension obligations lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit income costs in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants 

the company made contributions of 9 million 137 million and 180 million to its direct pension plans in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively in fiscal 2014 approximately 37 million of the contributions were made by a third party in connection with the sale of a business in a prior period on behalf of former employees who retained certain pension benefits future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2015 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 25 million in fiscal 2016 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company’s pension plans 

  

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency rates 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk foreign operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2015 and 2014 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2015 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates would have impacted revenues by approximately 31 million and 12 million respectively for each currency on an annual basis and would have impacted total segment ebitda by approximately 6 million and 02 million respectively on an annual basis 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 185 million as of june 30 2015 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately 19 million before tax any changes in fair value of the company’s common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed otherthantemporary 

  

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2015 or june 30 2014 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2015 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

australian media regulation 

the company’s subscription television interests are subject to australia’s regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry the key regulatory body for the australian broadcasting industry is the australian communications and media authority 

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50 of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters and b the broadcasting services act—this legislation may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including for example preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area 

uk press regulation 

on july 13 2011 prime minister david cameron announced a twopart inquiry into the uk press and appointed lord justice leveson as chairman of the inquiry the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company’s former publication the news of the world  hearings opened on november 14 2011 with respect to the first part of the inquiry and lord justice leveson published his report on november 29 2012 the report made recommendations on the future of press regulation and governance in the uk which have been the subject of debate in the uk parliament as well as discussion both among newspaper groups including news uk and the industry and the government a date has yet to be set for the second part of the inquiry 

on march 18 2013 the uk government published a draft royal charter on selfregulation of the press which if granted would establish a recognition panel that would be responsible for recognizing overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body the new press regulatory body a majority of the members of which would be independent of the industry would be responsible for overseeing the uk press and would replace the existing press complaints commission the uk government also proposed legislation which would ensure that the royal charter could only be altered by a twothirds majority of parliament in addition to the royal charter and establishment of a new regulatory body rules have been proposed which if adopted would result in publishers who do not participate in this new uk press regulatory system being potentially liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded 

  

in late 2013 publications representing the majority of the industry in the uk including news uk entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead which is referred to as the independent press standards organisation since then steps have been taken to form the new regulator and appoint an independent chairman and its board the new regulator is expected to be operational by september 2014 the new regulator will among other things oversee the press code of practice require members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and require selfreporting of any failures provide a complaints handling service have the ability to require publications to print corrections have the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code and be able to levy fines it may also introduce an arbitration service to resolve claims against publications when established the new regulatory regime will impose burdens on the print media including the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk which may represent competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance 

data privacy and security 

our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection use sharing protection and retention of personal data which continue to evolve in light of changes in information technology and analytics techniques that have implications for how such data is managed for example in the us the company’s websites mobile apps and other online business activities are subject to the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent and the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act of 2003 which regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails or “spam” in addition regulators such as the federal trade commission continue to expand their application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices including the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted internet advertisements many states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach 

similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the company operates including the european union and australia the european union is currently considering a new privacy regulation that would replace its existing data protection directive and if adopted in its current proposed form would expand the regulation of the collection use and security of personal data continue to restrict the transborder flow of such data introduce an expanded right of individuals to have their data deleted upon request enhance penalties for noncompliance and increase the enforcement powers of the european commission in australia recent changes in data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by among other things requiring the disclosure of crossborder data transfers and placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration 

in response to such developments industry participants in the us europe and australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industrylevel standards and practices including the implementation of selfregulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies such as the company to give consumers a better understanding of and greater control over advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior 

the company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments 

education 

the availability of funding for k12 education is affected by changes in legislation both at the federal and state level as well as changes in the state procurement process future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment leading to budget issues and resulting decreases in educational funding that could in turn have an adverse impact on the company’s digital education business

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

risks related to the company’s business 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its newspapers integrated marketing services and digital media properties the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and paytv programming expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns national and local economic conditions particularly in major metropolitan markets affect the levels of retail national and classified newspaper advertising revenue changes in gross domestic product consumer spending auto sales housing sales unemployment rates and job creation all impact demand for advertising a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers’ spending priorities or result in consolidation or closures across various industries which may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

the company’s ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for the company’s products demographics of the customer base advertising rates and results observed by advertisers for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers the number of visits to its websites and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed by advertisers when determining the amount of advertising to purchase from the company as well as advertising rates newer technologies including new streaming and downloading capabilities via the internet and other devices and technologies as well as growing consumer engagement with new forms of digital media such as online and mobile social networking are increasing the number of media choices and formats available to audiences resulting in audience fragmentation and increased competition for advertising these technological developments may also cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers in addition the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers reduced demand for the company’s offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets 

advertising circulation and audience share may continue to decline as consumers migrate to other media alternatives 

the company’s businesses face competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content delivery and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry including declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers’ increasing reliance on the internet for the delivery of news and information often without charge in recent years internet sites devoted to recruitment automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company’s newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales in addition due to innovations in content distribution platforms consumers are now 

  

more readily able to watch internetdelivered content on television sets and mobile devices in some cases also without charge which could reduce consumer demand for the company and its affiliates’ television programming and paytv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company 

the company must respond to new technologies and changes in consumer behavior in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content including the distribution of news and other content through social networking tools and on mobile and other devices digital distribution models for books and internet and mobile distribution of video content via streaming and downloading these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where and how they consume digital content content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet often without charge and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internetdelivered content on portable devices and televisions enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership which could negatively affect the company’s revenues new digital platforms and technologies such as usergenerated sites and selfpublishing tools have also reduced the cost of producing and distributing content on a wide scale allowing additional digital content providers to compete with us often at a lower cost this trend may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content in addition new digital distribution channels such as the internet and online retailers may present both challenges and opportunities to the company’s businesses including its traditional book publishing model which could affect both sales volume and pricing the company may be required to incur significant capital expenditures in order to respond to these new technologies and changes in consumer behavior and there is a risk that its responses and strategies to remain competitive including distribution of its content on a “pay” basis may not be adopted by consumers the company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new technologies products and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses asset values and results of operations

the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the related internal reorganization transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the separation if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and us stockholders and certain nonus stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition if the internal reorganization andor the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable 21st century fox would recognize gains on the internal reorganization andor recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company’s common stock distributed to 21st century fox’s stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox’s tax basis in such shares as described below the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing 

under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation the company will in certain circumstances be responsible for all taxes including interest and penalties and taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation specifically in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken or omitted to be taken after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions 1 were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel 2 violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement or 3 the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected after consultation with its advisors could result in any such determination the company will be responsible for any taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination 

the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox 

each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group which prior to the separation included 21st century fox the company and 21st century fox’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the separation consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any member of 21st century fox’s consolidated group the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

the company might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the separation because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for taxfree distributions for us federal income tax purposes 

the company’s ability to engage in significant strategic transactions and equity issuances may be limited or restricted after the separation in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution by 21st century fox even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporate level taxable gain to 21st century fox under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of shares of the company’s stock is acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to 21st century fox of the distribution and the internal transactions in connection with the distribution for us federal income tax purposes under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company entered into with 21st century fox the company is prohibited from taking or 

  

failing to take certain actions that may prevent the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree for us federal income tax purposes further for the twoyear period following the separation without obtaining the consent of 21st century fox the company may be prohibited from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions may limit the company’s ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of its business moreover the tax sharing and indemnification agreement also provides that the company is responsible for any taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the separation by or in respect of the company or any of its affiliates 

the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the us 

the federal communications commission “fcc” has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations television broadcast networks and newspapers the “broadcast ownership rules” and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest the “program access rules” under the fcc’s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above the murdoch family trust’s ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company’s businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules consequently the company’s future conduct including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company’s acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator may affect 21st century fox’s ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules therefore the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires after the distribution date newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business then the company will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules in addition the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor including a cable television operator if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business 

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century 

  

fox for certain liabilities as a result the company could be required under certain circumstances to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates’ representations covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement tax sharing and indemnification agreement or any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company’s ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities 

certain agreements that the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may limit its ability to take certain actions with respect to the civil uk newspaper matters 

under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement in consideration for 21st century fox’s agreement to certain indemnification arrangements the company agreed that 21st century fox would have the right to control the company’s defense of civil claims relating to the uk newspaper matters in exercising its rights to control the defense of the civil claims relating to the uk newspaper matters 21st century fox may be guided by interests that are different than or adverse to the company’s interests and the interests of its stockholders and advocate strategies that the company’s management would not otherwise adopt furthermore if the company fails to comply with these control arrangements or does not consent to settlements with respect to such matters proposed by 21st century fox the company has agreed with 21st century fox that it will at 21st century fox’s discretion forego any indemnification with regard to such or all of these matters the company’s inability to take actions with respect to these civil matters without 21st century fox’s consent or the company’s adoption of strategies advocated by 21st century fox could damage the company’s reputation or impair the company’s ability to conduct its business while the taking of any such action by the company without 21st century fox’s consent in breach of the company’s agreements could increase its liability exposure with regard to such matters and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 14 to the financial statements for additional information 

the company has a limited operating history as an independent publiclytraded company and its historical financial statements for certain reporting periods are not necessarily representative of the results it would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company do not reflect any subsequent changes in its cost structure and may not be reliable indicators of its future results 

the company’s historical financial statements for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013 and 2012 included in this annual report do not necessarily reflect the results of operations cash flows and financial condition that it would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company during the periods presented or those that it will achieve in the future prior to the separation the company’s business was operated by 21st century fox as part of its broader corporate organization rather than as an independent company during those periods 21st century fox performed various corporate functions for the company including but not limited to tax administration treasury activities accounting legal ethics and compliance program administration investor and public relations certain governance functions including internal audit and external reporting the company’s historical financial statements for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013 and 2012 reflect allocations of corporate expenses from 21st century fox for these and similar functions however these allocations may be more or less than the comparable expenses that the company would have incurred had it operated as an independent publicly traded company during those periods in addition changes have and may continue to occur in the company’s cost structure management financing business operations personnel needs tax and structure as a result of its operation as a public company separate from 21st century fox including the incurrence of costs for compliance with requirements of the sarbanesoxley act sec regulations and nasdaq and asx listing rules and potential increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale prior to the separation the company benefited from 21st century fox’s operating diversity size purchasing power and access to capital for investments and it may not continue to realize such benefits in the future as a result there is a risk that the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while it was still a part of 21st century fox additionally in connection with the separation the company entered into certain transactions with 21st century fox that did not exist prior to the separation 

  

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox and certain of the company’s officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of 21st century fox which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of 21st century fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and the chairman and chief executive officer of 21st century fox and gerson zweifach who serves as the company’s general counsel and as senior executive vice president and group general counsel of 21st century fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to 21st century fox instead of the company as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation the provisions in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company 

risks related to the company’s common stock 

the market price of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 12 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders and 13 overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions 

  

certain provisions of the company’s restated certificate of incorporation amended and restated bylaws tax sharing and indemnification agreement separation and distribution agreement and delaware law the company’s amended and restated stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement which it extended in june 2014 pursuant to the amended and restated stockholder rights agreement each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock immediately following the separation the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors the rights expire on june 18 2015 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement 

further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 8 2014 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of august 8 2014 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of august 8 2014 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from 

  

making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the amended and restated stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

in addition uk and us regulators and governmental authorities continue to conduct investigations initiated in 2011 with respect to the uk newspaper matters the investigation by the doj is directed at conduct that occurred within 21st century fox prior to the creation of the company accordingly 21st century fox has been and continues to be responsible for responding to the doj investigation the company together with 21st century fox is cooperating with these investigations 

civil claims have also been brought against the company with respect to the uk newspaper matters the company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases the company has also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme established by the company under which parties could pursue claims against it while additional civil lawsuits may be filed no additional civil claims may be brought under the compensation scheme after april 8 2013 

in connection with the separation the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that 21st century fox will indemnify the company for payments made after the distribution date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the uk newspaper matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the criminal matters other than fees expenses and costs relating to employees i who are not directors officers or certain designated employees or ii with respect to civil matters who are not codefendants with the company or 21st century fox in addition violations of law may result in criminal fines or penalties for which the company will not be indemnified by 21st century fox 21st century fox’s indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an aftertax basis 

the company incurred legal and professional fees related to the uk newspaper matters and costs for civil settlements totaling approximately 169 million 183 million and 199 million during the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively with respect to the fees and costs incurred during the fiscal year ended june 30 2014 the company has been or will be indemnified by 21st century fox for 97 million net of tax pursuant to the indemnification arrangements described above and with respect to the fees and costs incurred on or prior to june 30 2013 the company will be indemnified by 21st century fox for 40 million net of tax

the company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims or criminal matters it is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea judgment or similar result for which the company will not be indemnified could damage its reputation impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition

prior to the separation the company’s combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21st century fox the company’s 

  

financial statements for the fiscal year ended june 30 2012 were prepared on a combined basis and presented as carveout financial statements as the company was not a separate consolidated group prior to the distribution date these statements reflect the combined historical results of operations and cash flows of 21st century fox’s publishing businesses its education division and other australian assets 

the company’s consolidated and combined statements of operations for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013 and 2012 included allocations of general corporate expenses for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by 21st century fox and not recorded at the business unit level such as expenses related to finance human resources information technology facilities and legal among others these expenses were allocated to the company on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of consolidated or combined revenues operating income headcount or other measures of the company management believes the assumptions underlying these consolidated and combined financial statements including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21st century fox are reasonable nevertheless these consolidated and combined financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the company and may not reflect the company’s consolidated and combined results of operations and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the applicable periods actual costs that would have been incurred if the company had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure

segment analysis 

segment ebitda is defined as revenues less operating expenses and selling general and administrative expenses segment ebitda does not include depreciation and amortization impairment and restructuring charges equity earnings of affiliates interest net other net income tax benefit expense and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests management believes that segment ebitda is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the company’s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources within the company’s businesses segment ebitda provides management investors and equity analysts with a measure to analyze operating performance of each of the company’s business segments and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors’ data although historical results may not be indicative of future results as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors including customer tastes and preferences 

  

total segment ebitda is a nongaap measure and should be considered in addition to not as a substitute for net income loss cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap in addition this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items such as depreciation and amortization and impairment and restructuring charges which are significant components in assessing the company’s financial performance the following table reconciles total segment ebitda to net income

reconciliation of free cash flow available to news corporation 

free cash flow available to news corporation is a nongaap financial measure defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and rea group free cash flow plus cash dividends received from rea group 

the company considers free cash flow available to news corporation to provide useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after capital expenditures which can then be used for strategic opportunities including among others investing in the company’s business strategic acquisitions strengthening the company’s balance sheet dividend payouts and repurchasing stock a limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period management compensates for the limitation of free cash flow available to news corporation by also relying on the net change in cash and cash equivalents as presented in the company’s consolidated and combined statements of cash flows prepared in accordance with gaap which incorporates all cash movements during the period 

the following table presents a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow available to news corporation 

 

 free cash flow available to news corporation improved by 293 million in fiscal 2014 to  365 million from 72 million in fiscal 2013 primarily due to the changes in net cash provided by operating activities discussed above partially offset by increased capital expenditures 

free cash flow available to news corporation in fiscal 2013 of 72 million decreased from 408 million in fiscal 2012 primarily due to lower total segment ebitda higher payments under restructuring programs of 164 million increased pension and postretirement contributions of approximately 130 million and the inclusion of sports programming payments at fox sports australia of 125 million partially offset by lower capital expenditures of 43 million 

revolving credit agreement 

in october 2013 the company entered into a credit agreement the “credit agreement” which provides for an unsecured 650 million fiveyear revolving credit facility the “facility” to the company for general corporate purposes the facility has a sublimit of 100 million available for issuances of letters of credit under the credit agreement the company may request increases in the amount of the facility up to a maximum amount of 900 million subject to certain conditions stated in the credit agreement the company may borrow prepay and reborrow amounts under the facility during the term of the credit agreement all amounts under the credit agreement are due on october 23 2018 unless the commitments are terminated earlier either at the request of the company or if an event of default occurs by the designated agent at the request or with the consent of the lenders or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcyrelated events the company may request that the commitments be extended under certain circumstances as set forth in the credit agreement for up to two additional oneyear periods additionally interest on borrowings is based on either a a eurodollar rate formula or b the base rate formula each as set forth in the credit agreement 

  

the credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default with customary exceptions including limitations on the ability of the company and the company’s subsidiaries to engage in transactions with affiliates incur liens merge into or consolidate with any other entity incur subsidiary debt or dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or all or substantially all of the stock of its subsidiaries taken as a whole in addition the credit agreement requires the company to maintain an adjusted operating income leverage ratio of not more than 30 to 10 and an interest coverage ratio of not less than 30 to 10 if any of the events of default occur and are not cured within applicable grace periods or waived any unpaid amounts under the credit agreement may be declared immediately due and payable as of june 30 2014 the company was in compliance with all of the applicable debt covenants 

the applicable margin and the commitment fee are based on the pricing grid in the credit agreement which varies based on the company’s adjusted operating income leverage ratio as of june 30 2014 the company is paying a commitment fee of 025 on any undrawn balance and an applicable margin of 050 for a base rate borrowing and 150 for a eurodollar rate borrowing 

as of the date of this filing the company has not borrowed any funds under the facility 

commitments 

the company has commitments under certain firm contractual arrangements “firm commitments” to make future payments these firm commitments secure the future rights to various assets and services to be used in the normal course of operations the following table summarizes the company’s material firm commitments as of june 30 2014 

 

  

   the company has certain contracts to purchase newsprint ink and plates that require the company to purchase a percentage of its total requirements since the quantities purchased annually under these contracts are not fixed and are based on the company’s total requirements the amount of the related payments for these purchases is excluded from the table above 

the table also excludes the company’s pension other postretirement benefits “opeb” obligations and the gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions as the company is unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount and timing of the commitments the company made contributions of 137 million and 180 

  

million to its pension plans in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 respectively included within the total contributions for fiscal 2014 were contributions of approximately 37 million which were made by a third party in connection with the sale of a business in a prior period on behalf of former employees who retained certain pension benefits these contributions were a combination of required and voluntary contributions made to improve the funding status of the plans future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns and interest rates and statutory requirements the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 10 million in fiscal 2015 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2014 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans payments due to participants under the company’s pension plans are primarily paid out of underlying trusts payments due under the company’s opeb plans are not required to be funded in advance but are paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and are principally dependent upon the future cost of retiree medical benefits under the company’s opeb plans the company expects its net opeb payments to approximate 11 million in fiscal 2015 see note 15 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation for further discussion of the company’s pension and opeb plans 

in january 2014 the company signed a 30 year lease to relocate all of its various london operations to a single new location the lease terminates in fiscal 2044 with an early termination option in fiscal 2039 the company’s londonbased staff of news uk dow jones and harpercollins will be housed together for the first time which the company expects will allow for improved collaboration and additional efficiencies staff commenced relocation to the new london site in june 2014 in connection with this relocation the company will pay average rent of approximately 35 million a year the rental expense along with other facility related costs expected to be incurred approximates the costs the company would have incurred in its existing leased properties separately the company relocated the current us headquarters of harpercollins in june 2014 to a new location in manhattan to reduce future rental expense as a result of these relocations the company expects to incur incremental costs related to dual rent and other facility related costs during fiscal 2015 of approximately 25 million as well as approximately 70 million of capital expenditures during the year ended june 30 2014 the company recognized incremental costs related to dual rent and other facility related costs of 28 million of which 21 million was recognized in the news and information services segment 

contingencies 

as disclosed in the notes to the financial statements uk and us regulators and governmental authorities continue to conduct investigations initiated in 2011 with respect to the uk newspaper matters the investigation by the us department of justice the “doj” is directed at conduct that occurred within 21st century fox prior to the creation of the company accordingly 21st century fox has been and continues to be responsible for responding to the doj investigation the company together with 21st century fox is cooperating with these investigations 

civil claims have also been brought against the company with respect to the uk newspaper matters the company has admitted liability in many civil cases and has settled a number of cases the company has also settled a number of claims through a private compensation scheme established by the company under which parties could pursue claims against it while additional civil lawsuits may be filed no additional civil claims may be brought under the compensation scheme after april 8 2013  

in connection with the separation the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that 21st century fox will indemnify the company for payments made after the distribution date arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to the uk newspaper matters as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the criminal matters other than fees expenses and costs relating to employees i who are not directors officers or certain designated employees or ii with respect to civil matters who are not codefendants with the company or 21st century fox in addition violations of law may result in criminal fines or penalties for which the company will not be indemnified by 21st century fox 21st century fox’s indemnification obligations with respect to these matters will be settled on an aftertax basis 

  

as of june 30 2014 the company has provided for its best estimate of the liability for the claims that have been filed and costs incurred and has accrued approximately 110 million of which 66 million will be indemnified by 21st century fox and a corresponding receivable was recorded in amounts due from 21st century fox on the balance sheet it is not possible to estimate the liability or corresponding receivable for any additional claims that may be filed given the information that is currently available to the company if more claims are filed and additional information becomes available the company will update the liability provision and corresponding receivable for such matters 

the company is not able to predict the ultimate outcome or cost of the civil claims or criminal matters it is possible that these proceedings and any adverse resolution thereof including any fines or other penalties associated with any plea judgment or similar result for which the company will not be indemnified could damage its reputation impair its ability to conduct its business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 

the company’s operations are subject to tax in various domestic and international jurisdictions and as a matter of course it is regularly audited by federal state and foreign tax authorities the company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of pending tax matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition future results of operations or liquidity as subsidiaries of 21st century fox prior to the separation the company and each of its domestic subsidiaries have joint and several liability with 21st century fox for the consolidated us federal income taxes of the 21st century fox consolidated group relating to any taxable periods during which the company or any of the company’s domestic subsidiaries are or were a member of the 21st century fox consolidated group consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any other member of the 21st century fox consolidated group the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs or other taxing authorities in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation for the company’s summary of significant accounting policies 

longlived assets 

longlived assets including goodwill newspaper mastheads distribution networks publishing rights copyrighted products trademarks and property plant and equipment assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of longlived assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the company tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

the valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 as part of the company’s longrange planning process the company completed its annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test as a result the company determined that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 

the methods used to estimate the fair value measurements of impaired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included those based on the income approach including the discounted cash flow and relieffromroyalty methods and those based on the market approach primarily the guideline public company method significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation methods were discount rates ranging from 90350 longterm growth rates ranging from 0040 and royalty rates ranging from 0528 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation methods were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and control premiums ranging from 520 significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement 

the fair values of the company’s reporting units in fiscal 2014 exceeded the respective carrying values in a range from approximately 2 to 81 consequently no impairments were identified a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 400 basis point decrease in the projected cash flows terminal growth rate would have resulted in a reporting unit of the news and information services segment and the digital education segment failing step one of the goodwill impairment analysis which would have required the completion of step two of the goodwill impairment analysis the goodwill at risk associated with these reporting units is approximately 1692 million as of june 30 2014 the company will continue to monitor its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for possible future impairment 

property plant and equipment 

the company evaluates the carrying value of longlived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with asc 360 “property plant and equipment” “asc 360” an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities events or circumstances that might warrant an impairment recoverability review include among other things material declines in operating performance significant adverse market conditions and planned changes in the use of an asset group 

in determining whether the carrying value of an asset group is recoverable the company estimates undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated life of the primary asset of the asset group the estimates of such future cash flows require estimating such factors as future operating performance market conditions and the estimated holding period of each asset if all or a portion of the carrying value of an asset group is found to be nonrecoverable the company records an impairment charge equal to the difference between the asset group’s carrying value and its fair value the company generally measures fair value by considering sales prices for 

  

similar assets or by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate typical assumptions applied when using a marketbased approach include projected ebitda and related multiples typical assumptions applied when using an income approach include projected free cash flows discount rates and longterm growth rates all of these assumptions are made by management based on the best available information at the time of the estimates and are subject to deviations from actual results 

in fiscal 2014 the company determined that it would review its fixed assets at certain reporting units for recoverability as a result of our review the company determined that all such fixed assets were recoverable had the fair values of the longlived assets been hypothetically lowered by 10 the writedown of longlived assets would be immaterial 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available the company’s policy is to recognize when applicable interest and penalties on unrecognized income tax benefits as part of income tax expense benefit 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company’s employees participate in various defined benefit pension and postretirement plans sponsored by the company and its subsidiaries which are the direct obligations of the company “direct plans” in addition to the direct plans prior to the separation certain of the company’s employees participated in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by 21st century fox and as a result the statements of operations included expenses related to these shared plans including expenses related to the company’s employees as well as allocations of expenses related to corporate employees through the corporate expense allocations benefit costs related to employees’ participation in plans sponsored by 21st century fox did not recur in periods subsequent to the separation see note 1 and note 15 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation 

the company records amounts relating to its direct plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of 

  

significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets mortality and other actuarial assumptions net periodic benefit cost income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the expected longterm rate of return is based on a direct asset allocation assumption of 31 equities 53 fixedincome securities and 16 cash and other investments total net periodic benefit costs for these direct plans were 7 million 35 million and 31 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for direct pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the direct plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 net periodic benefit costs for its direct plans consist of the following 

 

 the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk and australia as of the measurement date the company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 43 in calculating the fiscal 2015 net periodic benefit costs the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 63 for fiscal 2015 based principally on a combination of current asset mix and historical experience of actual plan returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s pension plans as of june 30 2014 were approximately 528 million which increased from approximately 472 million for the company’s direct pension plans as of june 30 2013 this increase of 56 million was primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate in the us and uk plans and strengthening of the mortality tables utilized in measuring the company’s domestic obligations partially offset by an amendment to freeze future benefits for certain domestic pension benefit plans lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear benefit costs higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear benefit costs these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic benefit costs in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average life expectancy for plan participants 

the company made contributions of 137 million 180 million and 48 million to its direct pension plans in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively of the current year contributions approximately 37 million were made by a third party in connection with the sale of a business in a prior period on behalf of former employees who retained certain pension benefits future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns 

  

statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2014 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of approximately 10 million in fiscal 2015 the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 15 to the combined and consolidated financial statements of news corporation for further discussion of the company’s pension plans 

changes in net periodic benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency rates and stock prices the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency rate risk and stock price risk the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency rates 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk foreign operations 

because of fluctuations in exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2014 and 2013 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2014 a one cent change in each of the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling exchange rates will impact revenues by approximately 24 million for each currency on an annual basis and will impact total segment ebitda by approximately 4 million and 1 million respectively on an annual basis 

stock prices 

the company has common stock investments in publicly traded companies that are subject to market price volatility these investments had an aggregate fair value of approximately 151 million as of june 30 2014 a hypothetical decrease in the market price of these investments of 10 would result in a decrease in comprehensive income of approximately 15 million before tax any changes in fair value of the company’s common stock investments are not recognized unless deemed otherthantemporary 

  

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with multiple financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2014 or june 30 2013 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2014 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include a antisiphoning restrictions—currently under the ‘antisiphoning’ provisions of the australian broadcasting services act 1992 cth subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events for example the olympic games and certain australian rules football and cricket matches unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50 of the australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of australia’s two major governmentfunded broadcasters b the broadcasting services act—this legislation may impact the company’s ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including for example preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area and c convergence review—on april 30 2012 the thenminister for broadband communications and the digital economy released the final report of a comprehensive review of australia’s communications and media regulation in light of increasing convergence in media platforms the report covered a number of broad areas including media ownership laws media content standards the ongoing production and distribution of australian and local content and the allocation of radio communications spectrum in march 2013 legislation was passed in response to the convergence review that among other things reduced the license fees payable by fta networks by 50 no legislation has yet been introduced removing the prohibition on an fta network’s signal reaching greater than 75 of the australian population any further changes in australian media regulations could adversely impact the company’s australian businesses however the government that commissioned the convergence review lost power in the australian federal election held on september 7 2013 

  

uk press regulation 

on july 13 2011 prime minister david cameron announced a twopart inquiry into the uk press and appointed lord justice leveson as chairman of the inquiry the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company’s former publication the news of the world  hearings opened on november 14 2011 with respect to the first part of the inquiry and lord justice leveson published his report on november 29 2012 

the report made recommendations on the future of press regulation and governance in the uk which have been the subject of debate in the uk parliament as well as discussion both among newspaper groups including news uk and the industry and the government 

on march 18 2013 the uk government published a draft royal charter on selfregulation of the press which if granted would establish a recognition panel that would be responsible for recognizing overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body the new press regulatory body a majority of the members of which would be independent of the industry would be responsible for overseeing the uk press and would replace the existing press complaints commission the uk government has also proposed legislation which would ensure that the royal charter could only be altered by a twothirds majority of parliament in addition to the royal charter and establishment of a new regulatory body rules have been proposed which if adopted would result in publishers who do not participate in this new uk press regulatory system being potentially liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded 

on april 24 2013 an alternative proposed form of royal charter was published by a group representing a significant majority of the uk press including news uk this contained many similar provisions but omitted or varied several others including the requirement for any future alteration to be approved by a twothirds majority of parliament while a new regulatory regime is supported by the primary political parties in the uk and is likely to be introduced at this time it remains unclear what precise form the new regime will take and when it will come into force 

the new uk press regulatory body is likely to among other things introduce and oversee a revised press code require members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and require selfreporting of any failures provide a complaints handling service have the ability to require publications to print corrections have the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the press code and be able to levy fines it may also introduce an arbitration service to resolve claims against publications changes may also be made to uk data protection legislation if adopted the proposed new regulatory regime may impose burdens on the print media including the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk that represent competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance a date has yet to be set for the second part of the inquiry 

internet 

in the us the children’s online privacy protection act of 1998 “coppa” prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent in addition the controlling the assault of nonsolicited pornography and marketing act of 2003 “canspam” regulates the distribution of unsolicited commercial emails or “spam” online services provided by the company may be subject to coppa and canspam requirements 

us federal regulators’ interest in issues of privacy cybersecurity and data security has been steadily increasing on february 23 2012 the obama administration issued a white paper on consumer data privacy that includes a consumer privacy bill of rights the obama administration is convening a multistakeholder process to implement the bill of rights through industry codes of conduct that would be enforceable by the federal trade commission “ftc” and state attorneys general the obama administration also announced it would work with congress to implement these rights through legislation on march 26 2012 the ftc released a report 

  

on consumer privacy which sets forth a detailed privacy framework and urges industry to accelerate the pace of adoption of selfregulatory measures including more widespread adoption of a donottrack browser mechanism the report also recommends that congress consider baseline privacy legislation incorporating the principles articulated in the framework a number of privacy and data security bills have been introduced in both houses of congress that address the collection maintenance and use of personal information web browsing and geolocation data data security and breach notification requirements and cybersecurity several congressional hearings have examined privacy implications for online offline and mobile data some state legislatures have already adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate on the internet including measures relating to privacy data security and data breaches the industry released a set of selfregulatory online behavioral advertising principles in 2009 which have been implemented by web publishers online advertisers and online advertising networks in november 2011 these principles were extended to the use of online consumer data for purposes other than advertising it is unclear whether these and other industry selfregulatory efforts alone will address the concerns expressed by some federal and state officials about the collection of anonymous data online or via mobile applications to serve targeted content and advertising it is not possible to predict whether proposed privacy and data security legislation will be enacted or to determine what effect such legislation might have on the company’s business 

foreign governments are raising similar privacy and data security concerns in particular the eu has proposed a new privacy regulation the “eu regulation” that would replace the current data protection directive would tighten regulation of the collection use and security of online data and would continue to restrict the transborder flow of data european industry has implemented a selfregulatory regime for online behavioral advertising that is largely consistent with the us selfregulatory framework the proposed eu regulation will not be effective for at least two or three years and may undergo many changes before it is adopted it is unclear how the final eu regulation would affect the company’s business 

the company monitors pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments 

education 

the availability of funding for k12 education is affected by changes in legislation both at the federal and state level as well as changes in the state procurement process future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment leading to budget issues resulting in a decrease in educational funding 

intellectual property 

the company’s intellectual property assets include copyrights in newspapers books television programming and other content and technologies trademarks in names and logos domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights in addition its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products business methods andor services none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations the company derives value and revenue from these assets through among other things print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales the sale distribution andor licensing of print and digital books the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution andor licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services 

the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property in the us the uk australia and other foreign territories to protect these assets the company relies upon a combination of copyright trademark unfair competition patent trade secret and other laws and contract provisions however there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case policing unauthorized use of the company’s products services and content and related intellectual property is often 

  

difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the company’s intellectual property the company seeks to limit that threat through a combination of approaches including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws piracy including in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property 

third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the company’s intellectual property from time to time and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights irrespective of their validity such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the company’s operations moreover effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories therefore the company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement

 item 1a risk factors tableend you should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report in evaluating the company and its common stock if any of the following risks develop into actual events it could materially and adversely affect the company’s business results of operations or financial condition and could in turn impact the trading price of the company’s common stock the risk factors generally have been separated into three groups risks related to the company’s business risks related to the company’s separation from 21st century fox and risks related to the company’s common stock 

risks related to the company’s business 

a decline in customer advertising expenditures in the company’s newspaper and other businesses could cause its revenues and operating results to decline significantly in any given period or in specific markets 

the company derives substantial revenues from the sale of advertising on or in its newspapers integrated marketing services and digital media properties the company and its affiliates also derive revenues from the sale of advertising on their cable channels and paytv programming expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns national and local economic conditions particularly in major metropolitan markets affect the levels of retail national and classified newspaper advertising revenue changes in gross domestic product consumer spending auto sales housing sales unemployment rates job creation and circulation levels and rates all impact demand for advertising a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective 

  

advertisers’ spending priorities the company’s advertising revenues in the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 declined 7 as compared to the prior year due in large part to lower advertising revenues at its australian newspapers as a result of the weaker australian economy particularly among consumers as well as to a lesser extent declines in advertising revenues at dow jones these declines were offset in part by increased revenues in the company’s digital real estate services segment in addition to economic conditions other factors such as consolidation across various industries may also reduce the company’s overall advertising revenue 

demand for the company’s products is also a factor in determining advertising rates for example circulation levels for the company’s newspapers and ratings points for its cable channels are among the factors that are weighed when determining advertising rates in addition newer technologies including new downloading capabilities via the internet digital distribution models for books and other devices and technologies are increasing the number of media choices available to audiences these technological developments may cause changes in consumer behavior that could affect the attractiveness of the company’s offerings to advertisers 

in addition the range of advertising choices across digital products and platforms and the large inventory of available digital advertising space have historically resulted in significantly lower rates for digital advertising than for print advertising consequently the company’s digital advertising revenue may not be able to replace print advertising revenue lost as a result of the shift to digital consumption a decrease in advertising expenditures by the company’s customers reduced demand for the company’s offerings or a surplus of advertising inventory could lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising spending which could have an adverse effect on the company’s businesses and assets 

advertising circulation and audience share may continue to decline as consumers migrate to other media alternatives 

the company’s businesses face competition from other sources of news information and entertainment content delivery and the company may be adversely affected if consumers migrate to other media alternatives for example advertising and circulation revenues in the company’s news and information services segment may continue to decline reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry including declining newspaper buying by younger audiences and consumers’ increasing reliance on the internet for the delivery of news and information often without charge in recent years internet sites devoted to recruitment automobile sales and real estate services have become significant competitors of the company’s newspapers and websites for classified advertising sales as a result in the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 the company’s advertising revenues decreased 10 in the news and information services segment as compared to the prior year in addition due to innovations in content distribution platforms consumers are now more readily able to watch internetdelivered content on television sets and mobile devices in some cases also without charge which could reduce consumer demand for the company’s television programming and paytv services and adversely affect both its subscription revenue and advertisers’ willingness to purchase television advertising from the company 

the company must respond to changes in consumer behavior as a result of new technologies in order to remain competitive 

technology continues to evolve rapidly leading to alternative methods for the delivery and storage of digital content these technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when where and how they consume digital content content owners are increasingly delivering their content directly to consumers over the internet often without charge and innovations in distribution platforms have enabled consumers to view such internetdelivered content on portable devices and televisions there is a risk that the company’s responses to these changes and strategies to remain competitive including distribution of its content on a “pay” basis may not be adopted by consumers in addition enhanced internet capabilities and other new media may reduce the demand for newspapers and television viewership which could negatively affect the company’s revenues the trend toward digital media 

  

may drive down the price consumers are willing to spend on the company’s products disproportionately to the costs associated with generating content the company’s failure to protect and exploit the value of its content while responding to and developing new products and business models to take advantage of advancements in technology and the latest consumer preferences could have a significant adverse effect on its businesses asset values and results of operations 

the inability to renew sports programming rights could cause the revenue of certain of the company’s australian operating businesses to decline significantly in any given period 

the sports rights contracts between certain of the company’s australian operating businesses on the one hand and various professional sports leagues and teams on the other have varying duration and renewal terms as these contracts expire renewals on favorable terms may be sought however third parties may outbid the current rights holders for the rights contracts in addition professional sports leagues or teams may create their own networks or the renewal costs could substantially exceed the original contract cost the loss of rights could impact the extent of the sports coverage offered by the company and could adversely affect its revenues upon renewal the company’s results could be adversely affected if escalations in sports programming rights costs are unmatched by increases in subscriber and carriage fees and advertising rates 

no assurance of profitability of amplify 

many of amplify’s newer lines of business are still under development accordingly amplify’s prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stage of development particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as digital education these risks for amplify include but are not limited to an evolving business model and the management of growth amplify must among other things develop a customer base for its full range of offerings including by utilizing the existing customers associated with its data and analytics business implement and successfully execute its business and marketing strategy continue to develop and upgrade its software and content offerings respond to competitive developments and attract retain and motivate qualified personnel since the 2010 acquisition of wireless generation the former brand of amplify’s data and analytics business now amplify insight and the initiation of the development of the broader business initiatives of amplify the company’s digital education business has recorded a cumulative loss before income taxes of approximately 265 million through june 30 2013 the portion of this loss recognized in the year ended june 30 2013 was approximately 163 million losses are expected to be higher in fiscal 2014 as a result of continued product development efforts significant expenses associated with amplify’s businesses include salaries employee benefits and other routine overhead associated with product development there can be no assurance that amplify will be successful in addressing these risks or in achieving these goals and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on amplify’s business prospects financial condition and results of operations 

the company may make strategic acquisitions that could introduce significant risks and uncertainties 

in order to position its business to take advantage of growth opportunities the company may make strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties these risks and uncertainties include among others 1 the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner 2 the challenges in achieving strategic objectives cost savings and other anticipated benefits 3 the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses 4 the risk of diverting the attention of the company’s senior management from the company’s operations 5 the risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems 6 the difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses 7 potential future impairments of goodwill associated with the acquired business and 8 in some cases increased regulation if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with the company’s existing business the company’s business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

global economic conditions may have a continuing adverse effect on the company’s business 

the us and global economies have undergone a period of economic uncertainty which caused among other things a general tightening in the credit markets limited access to the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy lower consumer and business spending and lower consumer net worth the resulting pressure on the labor and retail markets and the downturn in consumer confidence weakened the economic climate in certain markets in which the company does business and has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on its business results of operations financial condition and liquidity a continued decline in these economic conditions could further impact the company’s business reduce its advertising and other revenues and negatively impact the performance of its newspapers books television operations and other consumer products these conditions could also impair the ability of those with whom the company does business to satisfy their obligations to the company in particular the company has significant exposure to certain australian business risks including specific australian legal and regulatory risks consumer preferences and competition because it holds a substantial amount of australian assets as a result the company’s results of operations may be adversely affected by negative developments in the australian market although the company believes that its capitalization and operating cash flow will give it the ability to meet its financial needs for the foreseeable future there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets will not impair the company’s liquidity or increase its cost of borrowing

the company could suffer losses due to asset impairment and restructuring charges 

as a result of adverse developments in the company’s industry and challenging economic and market conditions the company may recognize impairment charges for writedowns of goodwill and intangible assets as well as restructuring charges relating to the reorganization of its businesses which negatively impact the company’s financial results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 as part of its longrange planning process in preparation for the separation the company adjusted its future outlook and related strategy principally with respect to its news and information services business in australia and secondarily with respect to its news and information services businesses in the us these adjustments reflect adverse trends affecting the company’s news and information services segment including declines in advertising revenue and continued declines in the economic environment in australia and resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows consequently the company determined that the fair value of these reporting units had declined below their respective carrying values and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 14 billion 11 billion net of tax in the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 in response to these challenging conditions the company has reorganized its australian newspaper businesses and the company recognized 293 million of restructuring charges in the year ended june 30 2013 a significant portion of which resulted from its restructuring activities in australia and the uk 

in accordance with gaap the company will continue to perform an annual impairment assessment of its recorded goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets including newspaper mastheads and distribution networks during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year the company also continually evaluates whether current factors or indicators such as prevailing conditions in the capital markets or the economy generally require the performance of an interim impairment assessment of those assets as well as other investments and other longlived assets or require the company to engage in any additional business restructurings to address these conditions any significant shortfall now or in the future in advertising revenue andor the expected popularity of the programming for which the company has acquired rights could lead to a downward revision in the fair value of certain reporting units see “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—critical accounting policies” for an analysis of the sensitivity of the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets to changes in key assumptions any further downward revisions in the fair value of a reporting unit indefinitelived intangible assets investments or longlived assets could result in additional impairments for which noncash charges would be required any such charge could be material to the company’s reported results of operations the company may also incur additional restructuring charges in the future if it is required to further realign its resources in response to significant shortfalls in revenue or other adverse trends 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in governmental policy and regulation 

various aspects of the company’s activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world and the introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the company’s products and services are produced or distributed and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries could have a negative impact on its interests 

  

for example the company’s australian operating businesses may be adversely affected by changes in government policy regulation or legislation or the application or enforcement thereof applying to companies in the australian media industry or to australian companies in general this includes 

 

  

  

  

  

 on april 30 2012 the thenminister for broadband communications and digital economy released the final report of a comprehensive review of australia’s communications and media regulation referred to as the convergence review in march 2013 legislation was passed in response to the convergence review that among other things reduced the license fees payable by fta networks certain other legislative changes that would have had a significant impact on the way the company operates its business and which would have limited its ability to acquire new businesses were proposed by the australian government but withdrawn without becoming law any further changes in australian media regulations could adversely impact the company’s australian businesses however the government that commissioned the convergence review lost power in the australian federal election held on september 7 2013 

in addition the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk are likely to be subject to greater regulation and oversight following the implementation of recommendations of the leveson inquiry into the uk press which was established by prime minister david cameron in mid2011 the inquiry was triggered by allegations of illegal voicemail interception at the company’s former publication the news of the world  lord justice leveson chairman of the inquiry has concluded the first part of the inquiry and published a report in late november 2012 containing various recommendations for greater regulation and oversight of the uk press in response the uk government has proposed establishing a regulatory body to oversee the uk press a majority of the members of which would be independent of the industry if adopted a new regulatory regime may impose burdens on the print media in the uk including the company’s newspaper businesses in the uk that represent competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of compliance 

the company’s business could be adversely impacted by changes in educational funding 

the company’s us educational businesses may be adversely affected by changes in state educational funding as a result of changes in legislation both at the federal and state level changes in the state procurement process and changes in the condition of the local state or us economy future changes in federal funding and the state and local tax base could create an unfavorable environment leading to budget issues that result in a decrease in educational funding 

newsprint prices may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict and control 

newsprint is one of the largest expenses of the company’s publishing units during the year ended june 30 2013 the company’s average cost per ton of newsprint was approximately 30 higher than its historical average annual cost per ton over the past five fiscal years the price of newsprint has historically been volatile 

  

and the consolidation of newsprint mills over the years has reduced the number of suppliers which has led to increases in newsprint prices failure to maintain the company’s current consumption levels further supplier consolidation or the inability to maintain the company’s existing relationships with its newsprint suppliers could adversely impact newsprint prices in the future 

the company relies on network and information systems and other technology that may be subject to disruption or misuse which could result in improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information as well as increased costs or loss of revenue 

network and information systems and other technologies including those related to the company’s network management are important to its business activities network and information systemsrelated events such as computer hackings computer viruses worms or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdowns denial of service attacks malicious social engineering or other malicious activities or any combination of the foregoing could result in a disruption of the company’s services or improper disclosure of personal data or confidential information improper disclosure of such information could harm the company’s reputation require it to expend resources to remedy such a security breach or subject it to liability under laws that protect personal data resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 

technological developments may increase the threat of content piracy and limit the company’s ability to protect its intellectual property rights 

the company seeks to limit the threat of content piracy however policing unauthorized use of its products and services and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken by the company may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties developments in technology increase the threat of content piracy by making it easier to duplicate and widely distribute pirated material the company has taken and will continue to take a variety of actions to combat piracy both individually and in some instances together with industry associations however protection of the company’s intellectual property rights is dependent on the scope and duration of its rights as defined by applicable laws in the us and abroad and the manner in which those laws are construed if those laws are drafted or interpreted in ways that limit the extent or duration of the company’s rights or if existing laws are changed the company’s ability to generate revenue from its intellectual property may decrease or the cost of obtaining and maintaining rights may increase there can be no assurance that the company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its products services and intellectual property will be successful in preventing content piracy 

the company’s business relies on certain intellectual property and brands 

the company’s businesses rely on a combination of trademarks trade names copyrights and other proprietary rights as well as contractual arrangements including licenses to establish and protect their intellectual property and brand names the company believes its proprietary trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its continued success and its competitive position any impairment of any such intellectual property or brands could adversely impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition 

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations 

the company has significant operations in a number of foreign jurisdictions and certain of its operations are conducted in foreign currencies primarily the australian dollar and the british pound sterling the value of these currencies fluctuates relative to the us dollar as a result the company is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations in a given period or in specific markets 

labor disputes may have an adverse effect on the company’s business 

in a variety of the company’s businesses it engages the services of employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages such actions as well 

  

as higher costs in connection with these collective bargaining agreements or a significant labor dispute could have an adverse effect on the company’s business by causing delays in production or by reducing profit margins 

risks related to the company’s separation from 21st century fox 

if the separation together with certain related transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable transactions for us federal income tax purposes then the company 21st century fox and its stockholders could be subject to significant tax liability and the company may be required to indemnify 21st century fox for taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox 

in connection with the separation 21st century fox received a private letter ruling from the irs to the effect that among other things the distribution of the company’s class a common stock and class b common stock qualified as taxfree under sections 368 and 355 of the code except for cash received in lieu of fractional shares in addition 21st century fox received an opinion from its tax counsel confirming the taxfree status of the separation for us federal income tax purposes including the satisfaction of the requirements under section 368 and 355 of the code not specifically addressed in the irs private letter ruling the opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel is not binding on the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position 

the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations from the company and 21st century fox regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the internal transactions should be treated as taxable transactions if it determines that any of these facts assumptions representations or undertakings is not correct or has been violated or that the distribution or the internal transactions should be taxable for other reasons including as a result of a significant change in stock or asset ownership after the separation if the distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable the distribution could be treated as a taxable dividend or capital gain for us federal income tax purposes and us stockholders and certain nonus stockholders could incur significant us federal income tax liabilities in addition if the internal reorganization andor the distribution is ultimately determined to be taxable 21st century fox would recognize gains on the internal reorganization andor recognize gain in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of shares of the company’s common stock distributed to 21st century fox’s stockholders on the distribution date over 21st century fox’s tax basis in such shares as described below the company may in certain circumstances be required to indemnify 21st century fox for liabilities arising out of the foregoing 

under the terms of the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company and 21st century fox entered into in connection with the separation the company will in certain circumstances be responsible for all taxes including interest and penalties and taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of actions taken by the company or any of its subsidiaries after the separation specifically in the event that the distribution or the internal transactions intended not to be subject to tax were determined to be subject to tax and such determination was the result of certain actions taken or omitted to be taken after the separation by the company or any of its subsidiaries and such actions 1 were inconsistent with any representation or covenant made in connection with the private letter ruling or opinion of 21st century fox’s tax counsel 2 violated any representation or covenant made in the tax sharing and indemnification agreement or 3 the company or any of its subsidiaries knew or reasonably should have expected after consultation with its advisors could result in any such determination the company will be responsible for any taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox as a result of such determination 

the company could be liable for income taxes owed by 21st century fox 

each member of the 21st century fox consolidated group which prior to the separation included 21st century fox the company and 21st century fox’s other subsidiaries is jointly and severally liable for the us federal income tax liability of each other member of the consolidated group for periods prior to and including the 

  

separation consequently the company could be liable in the event any such liability is incurred and not discharged by any member of 21st century fox’s consolidated group the tax sharing and indemnification agreement requires 21st century fox to indemnify the company for any such liability disputes or assessments could arise during future audits by the irs in amounts that the company cannot quantify 

the company might not be able to engage in desirable strategic transactions and equity issuances following the separation because of certain restrictions relating to requirements for taxfree distributions for us federal income tax purposes 

the company’s ability to engage in significant strategic transactions and equity issuances may be limited or restricted after the separation in order to preserve for us federal income tax purposes the taxfree nature of the distribution by 21st century fox even if the distribution otherwise qualifies for taxfree treatment under section 355 of the code it may result in corporate level taxable gain to 21st century fox under section 355e of the code if 50 or more by vote or value of shares of the company’s stock is acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to 21st century fox of the distribution and the internal transactions in connection with the distribution for us federal income tax purposes under the tax sharing and indemnification agreement that the company entered into with 21st century fox the company is prohibited from taking or failing to take certain actions that may prevent the distribution and related transactions from being taxfree for us federal income tax purposes further for the twoyear period following the separation without obtaining the consent of 21st century fox the company may be prohibited from 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions may limit the company’s ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of its business moreover the tax sharing and indemnification agreement also provides that the company is responsible for any taxrelated liabilities incurred by 21st century fox or any of its affiliates as a result of the failure of the distribution or the internal transactions to qualify for favorable treatment under the code if such failure is attributable to certain actions taken after the separation by or in respect of the company or any of its affiliates 

the separation and distribution agreement may restrict the company from acquiring or owning certain types of assets in the us 

the federal communications commission “fcc” has promulgated certain rules and regulations that limit the ownership of radio and television broadcast stations television broadcast networks and newspapers the “broadcast ownership rules” and place commercial restrictions on a cable network programmer in which a cable television operator holds an ownership interest the “program access rules” under the fcc’s rules for determining ownership of the media assets described above the murdoch family trust’s ownership interest in both the company and 21st century fox following the separation would generally result in each company’s businesses and assets being attributable to the murdoch family trust for purposes of determining compliance with the broadcast ownership rules and the program access rules consequently the company’s future 

  

conduct including its acquisition of any newspapers in the same local markets in which 21st century fox owns or operates television stations or the company’s acquisition of an ownership interest in a cable operator may affect 21st century fox’s ability to own and operate its television stations or otherwise comply with the broadcast ownership rules or may subject 21st century fox to the program access rules therefore the company and 21st century fox agreed in the separation and distribution agreement that if the company acquires after the distribution date newspapers radio or television broadcast stations or television broadcast networks in the us and such acquisition would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business then the company will be required to take certain actions including divesting assets in order to permit 21st century fox to hold its media interests and to comply with such rules in addition the company will be prohibited from acquiring an interest in a multichannel video programming distributor including a cable television operator if such acquisition would subject 21st century fox to the program access rules to which it is not then subject this agreement effectively limits the activities or strategic business alternatives available to the company if such activities or strategic business alternatives implicate the broadcast ownership rules or program access rules and would impede or be reasonably likely to impede 21st century fox’s business 

the indemnification arrangements the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may require the company to divert cash to satisfy indemnification obligations to 21st century fox 

pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other related agreements 21st century fox agreed to indemnify the company for certain liabilities and the company agreed to indemnify 21st century fox for certain liabilities as a result the company could be required under certain circumstances to indemnify 21st century fox and its affiliates against certain liabilities to the extent such liabilities result from an action the company or its affiliates take or from any breach of the company or its affiliates’ representations covenants or obligations under the separation and distribution agreement tax sharing and indemnification agreement or any other agreement the company entered into in connection with the separation the diversion of cash that may occur if the company is required to indemnify 21st century fox under these agreements could limit the company’s ability to grow its businesses or capitalize on acquisition opportunities 

certain agreements that the company entered into with 21st century fox in connection with the separation may limit its ability to take certain actions with respect to the civil uk newspaper matters 

under the terms of the separation and distribution agreement in consideration for 21st century fox’s agreement to certain indemnification arrangements the company agreed that 21st century fox would have the right to control the company’s defense of civil claims relating to the uk newspaper matters in exercising its rights to control the defense of the civil claims relating to the uk newspaper matters 21st century fox may be guided by interests that are different than or adverse to the company’s interests and the interests of its stockholders and advocate strategies that the company’s management would not otherwise adopt furthermore if the company fails to comply with these control arrangements or does not consent to settlements with respect to such matters proposed by 21st century fox the company has agreed with 21st century fox that it will at 21st century fox’s discretion forego any indemnification with regard to such or all of these matters the company’s inability to take actions with respect to these civil matters without 21st century fox’s consent or the company’s adoption of strategies advocated by 21st century fox could damage the company’s reputation or impair the company’s ability to conduct its business while the taking of any such action by the company without 21st century fox’s consent in breach of the company’s agreements could increase its liability exposure with regard to such matters and adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition see “item 3 legal proceedings” and note 11 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation for additional information 

there can be no assurance that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

from time to time the company may need to access the longterm and shortterm capital markets to obtain financing although the company believes that the sources of capital currently in place will permit the company to finance its operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions the company’s access to 

  

and the availability of financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors including but not limited to 1 the company’s financial performance 2 the company’s credit ratings or absence of a credit rating 3 the liquidity of the overall capital markets and 4 the state of the economy there can be no assurance particularly as a new company that currently has no credit rating that the company will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to it 

the company may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that it expects to achieve as an independent publiclytraded company 

by separating from 21st century fox there is a risk that the company may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than it would have otherwise been while it was still a part of 21st century fox as part of 21st century fox the company was able to enjoy certain benefits from 21st century fox’s operating diversity and access to capital for investments which benefits are no longer available to the company after the separation 

as an independent publiclytraded company the company believes that its businesses will benefit from among other things sharpened focus on the financial and operational resources of its specific business allowing the company’s management to design and implement a capital structure corporate strategies and policies that are based primarily on the business characteristics and strategic opportunities of its businesses the company anticipates this will allow it to respond more effectively to industry dynamics and to create effective incentives for the company’s management and employees that are more closely tied to its business performance however the company may not be able to achieve some or all of the expected benefits if the company fails to achieve some or all of the benefits in the time it expects the company’s business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

the company has a very limited operating history as an independent publiclytraded company and its historical financial statements are not necessarily representative of the results it would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company and may not be reliable indicators of its future results 

the company’s historical financial statements included in this annual report do not necessarily reflect the results of operations cash flows and financial condition that it would have achieved as an independent publiclytraded company during the periods presented or those that it will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the following factors 

 

  

  

   

 the company’s accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which it is subject following the separation if the company is unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls its results of operations cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

the company’s financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of 21st century fox and the company believes that its reporting and control systems were appropriate for those of subsidiaries of a public company however the company was not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the exchange act as a result of the separation the company is directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the exchange act further beginning with the company’s annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending june 30 2014 it will be required to comply with section 404 of the sarbanes oxley act of 2002 which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting and a report by its independent registered public accounting firm these reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on the company’s management and administrative and operational resources including accounting resources to comply with these requirements the company may need to upgrade its systems including information technology and implement additional financial and management controls reporting systems and procedures the company expects to incur additional annual expenses related to these steps and those expenses may be significant if the company is unable to upgrade its financial and management controls reporting systems information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion the company’s ability to comply with its financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the exchange act could be impaired any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

certain of the company’s directors and officers may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their equity ownership in 21st century fox and certain of the company’s officers and directors may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because they also serve as officers andor on the board of directors of 21st century fox which may result in the diversion of corporate opportunities to 21st century fox 

certain of the company’s directors and executive officers own shares of 21st century fox’s common stock and the individual holdings may be significant for some of these individuals compared to their total assets in addition certain of the company’s officers and directors also serve as officers andor as directors of 21st century fox including k rupert murdoch who serves as the company’s executive chairman and the chairman and chief executive officer of 21st century fox and gerson zweifach who serves as the company’s general counsel and as senior executive vice president and group general counsel of 21st century fox this ownership or service to both companies may create or may create the appearance of conflicts of interest when these directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for the company and 21st century fox for example potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute that may arise between the company and 21st century fox regarding the terms of the agreements governing the internal reorganization the separation and the relationship thereafter between the companies including with respect to the indemnification of certain matters in addition to any other arrangements that the company and 21st century fox may agree to implement the company and 21st century fox have agreed that officers and directors who serve at both companies will recuse themselves from decisions where conflicts arise due to their positions at both companies 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation acknowledges that the company’s directors and officers as well as certain of its stockholders including k rupert murdoch certain members of his family and certain family trusts so long as such persons continue to own in the aggregate 10 or more of the voting stock of each of the company and 21st century fox each of which is referred to as a covered stockholder are or may 

  

become stockholders directors officers employees or agents of 21st century fox and certain of its affiliates the company’s restated certificate of incorporation provides that any such overlapping person will not be liable to the company or to any of its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty that would otherwise exist because such individual directs a corporate opportunity other than certain limited types of restricted business opportunities set forth in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation to 21st century fox instead of the company as 21st century fox does not have a similar provision regarding corporate opportunities in its certificate of incorporation the provisions in the company’s restated certificate of incorporation could result in an overlapping person submitting any corporate opportunities other than restricted business opportunities to 21st century fox instead of the company 

risks related to the company’s common stock 

the market price of the company’s stock may fluctuate significantly 

the company cannot predict the prices at which its common stock may trade the market price of the company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly depending upon many factors some of which may be beyond its control including 1 the company’s quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in its industry 2 actual or anticipated fluctuations in the company’s operating results 3 success or failure of the company’s business strategy 4 the company’s ability to obtain financing as needed 5 changes in accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 6 changes in laws and regulations affecting the company’s business 7 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant new business developments or customers 8 announcements by the company or its competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions 9 changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or the company’s ability to meet its earnings guidance if any 10 the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies 11 results from material litigation or governmental investigations 12 changes in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders and 13 overall market fluctuations and general economic conditions 

certain provisions of the company’s certificate of incorporation bylaws tax sharing and indemnification agreement separation and distribution agreement and delaware law the company’s stockholder rights agreement and the ownership of the company’s common stock by the murdoch family trust may discourage takeovers and the concentration of ownership will affect the voting results of matters submitted for stockholder approval 

the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain certain antitakeover provisions that may make more difficult or expensive a tender offer change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by the company’s board of directors or certain stockholders holding a significant percentage of the voting power of the company’s outstanding voting stock in particular the company’s restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provide for among other things 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control of the company even in the case where a majority of the stockholders may consider such proposals if effective desirable 

in addition in connection with the separation the company’s board of directors adopted a stockholder rights agreement pursuant to which each outstanding share of the company’s common stock has attached to it a right entitling its holder to purchase from the company additional shares of its class a common stock and class b common stock in the event that a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 15 or more of the thenoutstanding class b common stock without approval of the company’s board of directors subject to exceptions for persons beneficially owning 15 or more of the company’s class b common stock as of may 24 2013 the stockholder rights agreement could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire the company’s voting common stock without the approval of its board of directors acquisitions of shares of the company’s class b common stock as a result of acquiring additional 21st century fox class b common stock prior to the separation or shares representing the company’s class b common stock in the whenissued trading market or as a result of the separation will each be included in determining the beneficial ownership of a person and all such acquisitions made after may 24 2013 will be taken into account in determining whether a person is an acquiring person under the terms of the stockholder rights agreement the rights expire on june 28 2014 except as otherwise provided in the rights agreement 

further as a result of his ability to appoint certain members of the board of directors of the corporate trustee of the murdoch family trust which beneficially owns less than one percent of the company’s outstanding class a common stock and approximately 384 of the company’s class b common stock as of september 10 2013 k rupert murdoch may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the shares beneficially owned by the murdoch family trust k rupert murdoch however disclaims any beneficial ownership of these shares also k rupert murdoch beneficially owns or may be deemed to beneficially own an additional one percent of the company’s class b common stock and less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock as of september 10 2013 thus k rupert murdoch may be deemed to beneficially own in the aggregate less than one percent of the company’s class a common stock and approximately 394 of the company’s class b common stock as of september 10 2013 this concentration of voting power could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition of the company additionally the ownership concentration of class b common stock by the murdoch family trust increases the likelihood that proposals submitted for stockholder approval that are supported by the murdoch family trust will be adopted and proposals that the murdoch family trust does not support will not be adopted whether or not such proposals to stockholders are also supported by the other holders of class b common stock furthermore the adoption of the stockholder rights agreement will prevent unless the company’s board of directors otherwise determines at the time other potential stockholders from acquiring a similar ownership position in the company’s class b common stock and accordingly could prevent a meaningful challenge to the murdoch family trust’s influence over matters submitted for stockholder approval

in addition uk and us regulators and governmental authorities continue to conduct investigations initiated in 2011 with respect to the uk newspaper matters the investigation by the doj is directed at conduct that occurred within 21st century fox prior to the creation of the company accordingly 21st century fox has been and continues to be responsible for responding to the doj investigation the company together with 21st century fox is cooperating with these investigations

prior to the separation the company’s combined financial statements were prepared on a standalone basis derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of 21st century fox the company’s financial statements as of june 30 2012 and for the fiscal years ended june 30 2012 and 2011 are on a combined basis and presented as carveout financial statements as the company was not a separate consolidated group prior to the distribution date these statements reflect the combined historical results of operations financial position and cash flows of 21st century fox’s publishing businesses its education division and other australian assets subsequent to the distribution date the company’s financial statements as of and for the year ended june 30 2013 are presented on a consolidated basis as the company became a separate consolidated group 

  

the company’s consolidated and combined statements of operations the “statements of operations” for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013 2012 and 2011 include allocations of general corporate expenses for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized basis by 21st century fox and not recorded at the business unit level such as expenses related to finance human resources information technology facilities and legal among others these expenses have been allocated to the company on the basis of direct usage when identifiable with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of combined or consolidated revenues operating income headcount or other measures of the company management believes the assumptions underlying the combined and consolidated financial statements the “financial statements” including the assumptions regarding allocating general corporate expenses from 21st century fox are reasonable nevertheless the financial statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred by the company and may not reflect the company’s consolidated and combined results of operations financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the periods presented actual costs that would have been incurred if the company had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas including information technology and infrastructure 

the company’s consolidated balance sheet as of june 30 2013 consists of the company’s consolidated balances subsequent to the separation the balances reflect the assets and liabilities that were historically included in 21st century fox’s publishing business its education division and other australian assets as well as assets and liabilities transferred to the company as part of the internal reorganization all assets and liabilities included in the company’s consolidated balance sheet are recorded on a historical cost basis the company’s combined balance sheet as of june 30 2012 consists of the combined balances of 21st century fox’s publishing businesses its education division and other australian assets the consolidated and combined balance sheets will be referred to as the “balance sheets” herein

for purposes of the company’s financial statements for periods prior to the separation income tax expense has been recorded as if the company filed tax returns on a standalone basis separate from 21st century fox this separate return methodology applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if the company was a standalone enterprise for the periods prior to the distribution date therefore cash tax payments and items of current and deferred taxes may not be reflective of the company’s actual tax balances prior to or subsequent to the separation prior to the distribution date the company’s operating results were included in 21st century fox’s consolidated us federal and state income tax returns pursuant to rules promulgated by the internal revenue service and various state taxing authorities the company will file its initial us income tax returns for the period june 29 2013 through june 30 2013

critical accounting policies 

an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to the company’s financial condition and results and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application the 

  

development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been determined by management of the company see note 2 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation for the company’s summary of significant accounting policies 

intangible assets 

the company has a significant amount of intangible assets including goodwill newspaper mastheads distribution networks publishing rights and other copyright products and trademarks intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill is recorded as the difference between the cost of acquiring an entity and the estimated fair values assigned to its tangible and identifiable intangible net assets and is assigned to one or more reporting units for purposes of testing for impairment 

determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management’s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows discount rates asset lives and market multiples among other items identifying reporting units and assigning goodwill to them requires judgment involving the aggregation of business units with similar economic characteristics and the identification of existing business units that benefit from the acquired goodwill the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of intangible assets acquired their reporting unit as well as their useful lives can significantly impact net income the company allocates goodwill to disposed businesses using the relative fair value method 

the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter and at other times if a significant event or change in circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of these assets has been reduced the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment assessments indicators such as unexpected adverse economic factors unanticipated technological change or competitive activities loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has become impaired 

the valuation of goodwill requires assumptions and estimates of many factors including revenue and market growth operating cash flows market multiples and discount rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 as part of the company’s longrange planning process in preparation for the separation the company adjusted its future outlook and related strategy principally with respect to the news and information services business in australia and secondarily with respect to the news and information services businesses in the us which resulted in a reduction in expected future cash flows as a result the company determined that the fair value of these reporting units declined below their respective carrying values the company recorded noncash impairment charges of approximately 14 billion 11 billion net of tax during the fiscal year ended june 30 2013 the charges consisted of a writedown of goodwill of 494 million a writedown of indefinitelived intangible assets of 862 million and a writedown of fixed assets of 46 million the impairment charges also include 42 million for the potential sale of assets at values below their carrying value 

the methods used to estimate the fair value measurements of impaired goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets included those based on the income approach including the discounted cash flow and relieffromroyalty methods and those based on the market approach primarily the guideline public company method significant unobservable inputs utilized in the income approach valuation methods were discount rates ranging from 110145 longterm growth rates ranging from 0515 and royalty rates ranging from 0515 significant unobservable inputs utilized in the market approach valuation methods were ebitda multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and a control premium of 5 significant increases decreases in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples assuming no change in discount rates would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement significant decreases increases in discount rates assuming no changes in royalty rates growth rates control premium and multiples would result in a significantly higher lower fair value measurement a hypothetical 10 decrease in 

  

the fair value of the reporting unit with the goodwill impairment would not result in an additional writedown of goodwill as all of the goodwill for this reporting unit has been written off had the fair values of indefinitelived intangible assets with impairments been hypothetically lowered by 10 the additional writedown of indefinitelived intangible assets would be immaterial 

income taxes 

the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and records its tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences in its reported results of operations tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the company’s tax expense and in evaluating its tax positions including evaluating uncertainties as promulgated under asc 740 “income taxes” 

the company’s annual tax rate is based on its income statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates significant management judgment is required in determining the company’s provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against the company’s net deferred tax assets if any in assessing the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets management considers estimates of the amount and character of future taxable income the company’s actual effective tax rate and income tax expense could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items including changes in income tax laws tax planning and the company’s forecasted financial condition and results of operations in future periods although the company believes current estimates are reasonable actual results could differ from these estimates 

the company recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement significant management judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and if so the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements management reevaluates tax positions each period in which new information about recognition or measurement becomes available 

retirement benefit obligations 

the company provides defined benefit pension postretirement health care defined contribution and medical benefits to the company’s eligible employees and retirees certain of the company’s employees participate in defined benefit pension plans sponsored by 21st century fox prior to the separation the statements of operations included expenses related to these shared plans including direct expenses related to the company’s employees as well as allocations of expenses related to corporate employees through the corporate expense allocations see note 1 to the consolidated and combined financial statements of news corporation 

certain employee benefit plans are the direct obligations of the company and have been recorded within the company’s historical financial statements the company records amounts relating to these direct plans based on calculations specified by gaap the measurement and recognition of costs of the company’s direct pension and other postretirement benefit plans require the use of significant management judgments including discount rates expected return on plan assets future compensation and other actuarial assumptions for financial reporting purposes direct net periodic pension expense income is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets current market conditions including changes in investment returns and interest rates were considered in making these assumptions in developing the expected longterm rate of return the direct pension portfolio’s past average rate of returns and future return expectations of the various asset classes were considered the expected longterm rate of return is based on a direct asset allocation assumption of 38 equities 48 fixedincome securities and 

  

14 cash and other investments total direct benefit plan net expenses recorded for these direct plans by the company were 35 million 31 million and 38 million for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively 

the discount rate reflects the market rate for highquality fixedincome investments on the company’s annual measurement date of june 30 and is subject to change each fiscal year the discount rate assumptions used to account for direct pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled the rate was determined by matching the company’s expected benefit payments for the direct plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed using a portfolio of several hundred highquality noncallable corporate bonds 

the key assumptions used in developing the company’s fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 net periodic pension expense for its direct plans consist of the following 

 

 the weighted average discount rate is volatile from year to year because it is determined based upon the prevailing rates in the us the uk and australia as of the measurement date the company will utilize a weighted average discount rate of 46 in calculating the direct fiscal 2014 net periodic pension expense the company will use a weighted average longterm rate of return of 68 for fiscal 2014 based principally on a combination of direct asset mix and historical experience of direct actual plan returns the accumulated net pretax losses on the company’s direct pension plans as of june 30 2013 were approximately 472 million which increased from approximately 455 million as of june 30 2012 this increase of approximately 17 million was due primarily to changes in inflation rates and the strengthening of the mortality tables used for the company’s foreign pension plans offset by the impact of changes in the discount rates used domestically lower discount rates increase present values of benefit obligations and increase the company’s deferred losses and also increase subsequentyear pension expense higher discount rates decrease the present values of benefit obligations and reduce the company’s accumulated net loss and also decrease subsequentyear pension expense these deferred losses are being systematically recognized in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with asc 715 “compensation—retirement benefits” unrecognized losses in excess of 10 of the greater of the marketrelated value of plan assets or the plan’s projected benefit obligation are recognized over the average future service of the plan participants or average life expectancy for plan participants for plans where the majority of plan participants are not accruing additional benefits 

the company made contributions of 180 million 48 million and 45 million to its direct pension plans in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively future plan contributions are dependent upon actual plan asset returns statutory requirements and interest rate movements assuming that actual plan returns are consistent with the company’s expected plan returns in fiscal 2013 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company anticipates that it will make contributions of 21 million in fiscal 2014 assuming that actual plan asset returns are consistent with the company’s expected returns in fiscal 2013 and beyond and that interest rates remain constant the company will continue to make voluntary contributions as necessary to improve the funded status of the plans see note 13 to the combined and consolidated financial statements of news corporation for further discussion of the company’s pension plans 

  

changes in net periodic pension expense may occur in the future due to changes in the company’s expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events the following table highlights the sensitivity of the company’s pension obligations and expense to changes in these assumptions assuming all other assumptions remain constant

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend the company has exposure to different types of market risk including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and stock prices the company neither holds nor issues financial instruments for trading purposes 

the following sections provide quantitative information on the company’s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and stock price risk the company makes use of sensitivity analyses that are inherently limited in estimating actual losses in fair value that can occur from changes in market conditions 

foreign currency exchange rates 

the company conducts operations in three principal currencies the us dollar the australian dollar and the british pound sterling these currencies operate primarily as the functional currency for the company’s us australian and uk operations respectively cash is managed centrally within each of the three regions with net earnings reinvested locally and working capital requirements met from existing liquid funds to the extent such funds are not sufficient to meet working capital requirements funding in the appropriate local currencies is made available from intercompany capital the company does not hedge its investments in the net assets of its australian and uk foreign operations 

because of fluctuations in currency exchange rates the company is subject to currency translation exposure on the results of its operations foreign currency translation risk is the risk that exchange rate gains or losses arise from translating foreign entities’ statements of earnings and balance sheets from functional currency to the company’s reporting currency the us dollar for consolidation purposes the company does not hedge translation risk because it generally generates positive cash flows from its international operations that are typically reinvested locally currency exchange rates with the most significant impact to its translation include the australian dollar and british pound sterling as currency exchange rates fluctuate translation of its statements of operations into us dollars affects the comparability of revenues and operating expenses between years 

the table below details the percentage of revenues and expenses by the three principal currencies for the fiscal years ended june 30 2013 and 2012 

 

 based on the year ended june 30 2013 a one cent change in both the us dollaraustralian dollar and the us dollarbritish pound sterling rates will impact revenues by approximately 28 million and 23 million respectively on an annual basis and will impact total segment ebitda by approximately 4 million and 03 million respectively on an annual basis 

stock prices 

the company has one common stock investment in a publicly traded company that is subject to market price volatility this investment is a cost method investment which is not material as a result the company has limited exposure to stock price risk 

  

credit risk 

cash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk 

the company’s receivables did not represent significant concentrations of credit risk as of june 30 2013 or june 30 2012 due to the wide variety of customers markets and geographic areas to which the company’s products and services are sold 

the company monitors its positions with and the credit quality of the financial institutions which are counterparties to its financial instruments the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements as of june 30 2013 the company did not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties

 item 11 executive compensation tableend compensation discussion and analysis 

introduction 

on june 28 2013 the company completed its separation from 21st century fox and became an independent publiclytraded company 21st century fox’s management andor the compensation committee of its board of directors made many of the fiscal 2013 compensation decisions described in this annual report for the company’s named executive officers mr robert j thomson the company’s chief executive officer and mr bedi ajay singh the company’s chief financial officer two additional executive officers mr k rupert murdoch the company’s executive chairman and mr gerson zweifach the company’s general counsel were executive officers of 21st century fox prior to the separation and continue to serve in such capacities following the separation during fiscal 2013 neither mr kr murdoch nor mr zweifach received compensation in their capacities as executive officers of the company therefore neither mr kr murdoch nor mr zweifach are named executive officers of the company and in accordance with sec rules no compensation is reflected in the compensation tables in this “executive compensation” section for such period 

effective upon the separation the company’s board of directors established its own compensation committee the “compensation committee” or the “committee” which is responsible for determining the compensation of the company’s executive officers following the separation including the compensation for the named executive officers this compensation discussion and analysis discusses the main elements of the company’s compensation program applicable to the named executive officers for fiscal 2013 explains the committee’s compensation philosophy going forward and describes certain actions taken by the committee in fiscal 2014 with regard to the company’s compensation program including compensation for the named executive officers in this compensation discussion and analysis the company differentiates between decisions made by its compensation committee and decisions made by 21st century fox’s management or the 21st century fox compensation committee the “fox compensation committee” where appropriate 

compensation philosophy 

the compensation committee has established a compensation philosophy that seeks to create longterm growth and value for stockholders the key objectives of this philosophy are to 

 

  

  

 the principles that guide these objectives are 

 

  

   

 the company and the compensation committee will continue to consider develop and refine the company’s compensation philosophy structure practices and procedures in order to maintain a focus on pay for performance while enabling the company to attract retain and motivate the top executive talent necessary to drive its success 

new executive compensation practices 

following the separation the board andor the compensation committee adopted or ratified a number of executive compensation and governance practices designed to enhance longterm value for the company’s stockholders these practices include 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 involvement of 21st century fox management and the fox compensation committee in 2013 executive compensation decisions 

prior to the separation compensation decisions regarding the company’s named executive officers were made by 21st century fox’s management andor the fox compensation committee as described in further detail below 

role of 21st century fox in compensation decisions 

for fiscal 2013 21st century fox management andor the fox compensation committee made many of the decisions related to the compensation of the named executive officers with the exception of the actual amount of annual cash incentive compensation paid to each officer for the fiscal year which was determined by the company’s compensation committee following the separation 21st century fox management presented individual compensation packages to the fox compensation committee for the named executive officers based on their assessment of the executive’s level of responsibility expected performance and contribution to the future success and performance of the company following the separation compensation practices in light of the industry in which the company operates and retention considerations the fox compensation committee considered these recommendations along with the advice of its compensation consultant 

role of the 21st century fox compensation consultant 

in fiscal 2013 the fox compensation committee retained the services of an external compensation consultant deloitte to advise the committee with respect to executive officer compensation arrangements 

  

including for the named executive officers the fox compensation committee reviewed information provided by deloitte when determining the appropriate level and mix of compensation for each named executive officer in addition deloitte advised the fox compensation committee regarding the design of the company’s longterm incentive plan the company’s compensation committee has determined to retain the services of deloitte as its external compensation consultant to assist the compensation committee with its review of the company’s executive compensation arrangements 

information on peer companies 

in order to attract and retain top executives with the requisite skills and experience to successfully manage its businesses the named executive officers’ compensation packages must be competitive particularly relative to the company’s peers in connection with the separation the fox compensation committee in consultation with deloitte considered a peer group comprised of companies that it believed more accurately reflected the company’s market competitors as compared to the peer group previously developed for 21st century fox in identifying the appropriate companies for inclusion in the company’s peer group the fox compensation committee with deloitte’s assistance considered companies in the publishing andor media industries that were similar in size to the company based on revenue and market capitalization and selected the companies listed below as of october 15 2012 annual revenue for the peer group for the trailing 12 months ranged from approximately 30 billion to 145 billion and market capitalizations ranged from approximately 40 billion to 230 billion as compared to fiscal 2013 revenue of approximately 89 billion and a market capitalization as of september 10 2013 of approximately 96 billion for the company 

 

 the fox compensation committee considered the compensation practices of this peer group as well as current market trends and practices generally in developing the compensation packages for the company’s executive officers including the named executive officers however the fox compensation committee did not “benchmark” individual compensation levels against this peer group given the diverse nature of the company which comprises businesses in multiple industries and markets the fox compensation committee did not believe that strict benchmarking against the peer group would provide a meaningful basis for establishing compensation as a result the fox compensation committee did not use peer company data to base justify or provide a framework for compensation decisions nor did it target any element of compensation or total compensation to a specific range within the peer companies rather the fox compensation committee used this information to obtain a general understanding of current compensation practices among similarlysized publishing and media companies 

the company and the compensation committee are reviewing this peer group and may make further changes if they believe such changes better reflect the company’s competitive landscape or if necessary to account for any corporate changes including acquisitions and dispositions 

  

named executive officer compensation 

overview of compensation program 

the company’s executive compensation program is comprised of three primary elements base salary annual cash incentive compensation and longterm equitybased incentive awards the company also provides retirement benefits and limited perquisites to the named executive officers the chart below describes the purpose for each element of compensation 

 

 in determining the appropriate level of compensation for each named executive officer the committee considers 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in fiscal 2013 the company’s named executive officers were messrs thomson and singh during fiscal 2013 each of messrs thomson and singh entered into employment agreements that were approved andor ratified by the fox compensation committee the overall level of compensation approved by 21st century fox management and the fox compensation committee reflects their assessment of the factors described above for a detailed description of these employment agreements please see the section entitled “employment agreements” 

messrs kr murdoch and zweifach do not have employment agreements with the company and as indicated above neither executive officer received compensation in his capacity as an executive officer of the company for fiscal 2013 for fiscal 2014 mr kr murdoch’s compensation for services provided to the company was determined and approved by the fox compensation committee prior to the separation as part of a comprehensive review of his target total direct compensation for both the company and 21st century fox in light of his responsibilities at each company any future decisions regarding mr kr murdoch’s compensation for his services provided to the company will be determined and approved annually by the company’s compensation committee mr zweifach’s services are provided to the company pursuant to the transition services agreement between the company and 21st century fox under the transition services agreement the company compensates 21st century fox for mr zweifach’s services and he receives no compensation directly from the company for those services 

  

base salary 

base salary is intended to attract and retain employees as it is the fixed element of an executive officer’s annual cash compensation and does not vary with performance base salaries for the company’s named executive officers are established in the context of the factors described above recommendations from the company’s executive chairman and the company’s chief executive officer with the exception of their own base salaries and the company’s overall compensation philosophy the employment arrangements of messrs thomson and singh provide for a specified or minimum base salary that was established taking into account these factors 

fiscal 2013 base salaries for messrs thomson and singh of 2000000 and 1100000 respectively were determined by 21st century fox management and the fox compensation committee in connection with the approval of their respective employment agreements the actual amount of salary paid for fiscal 2013 for each of messrs thomson and singh which was prorated to reflect each officer’s employment commencement date is set forth in the summary compensation table below 

the company’s compensation committee annually reviews the base salary of each of the named executive officers subject to the terms of their employment agreements the compensation committee may adjust the base salary as appropriate or if a different mix of compensation elements may more appropriately compensate the individual named executive officer in light of the company’s compensation objectives for fiscal 2014 the compensation committee did not make any changes to the annual base salaries for messrs thomson and singh prior to the separation the fox compensation committee approved an annual base salary for fiscal 2014 of 1000000 for mr kr murdoch for his service as the company’s executive chairman 

annual cash incentive compensation 

annual cash incentive compensation is intended to incentivize and reward the company’s named executive officers for achieving the company’s operational and strategic goals and for superior individual performance in a particular year the company’s annual cash incentive compensation is intended to link executives’ interests directly with the annual operating strategies and financial and qualitative goals of the business as the executive officers have a direct influence on the company’s operations and strategy the compensation committee has adopted an annual cash incentive framework which fosters a performancedriven payforperformance culture that aligns its executive officers’ interests with those of its stockholders while also rewarding the executive officers for superior individual achievements 

fiscal 2013 annual cash incentive compensation 

pursuant to their employment agreements messrs thomson and singh were eligible to receive an annual cash incentive with a target amount of 2000000 and 1000000 respectively prorated for fiscal 2013 to reflect each named executive officer’s respective employment commencement date these targets amounts were set by 21st century fox management and the fox compensation committee based on their consideration of the factors described above in light of the timing of the separation the new roles of the company’s named executive officers their focus on the execution of the separation and preparation to operate the company as an independent company and the fact that the company’s businesses were not previously operated as a single reporting unit 21st century fox management and the fox compensation committee determined that the company’s compensation committee should be able to exercise discretion in determining the amount of the annual cash incentive if any to be paid to messrs thomson and singh for fiscal 2013 following the separation this decision was intended to preserve flexibility to appropriately account for the contributions of the named executive officers in light of the unique circumstances of the separation and the strategic and leadershiporiented goals of the named executive officers for fiscal 2013 many of which required qualitative subjective assessment of their achievement that could not be reduced to formulaic numerical targets or anticipated in advance 

  

for fiscal 2013 the compensation committee evaluated the performance of each of messrs thomson and singh in executing the separation and preparing the company to operate as an independent publiclytraded company the compensation committee noted each officer’s significant and numerous contributions and strong leadership in the development and implementation of a new corporate vision strategy and organizational structure for the company’s businesses in assessing each officer’s performance and determining the appropriate award amounts the compensation committee acknowledged the following specific achievements 

for mr thomson 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 for mr singh 

 

  

  

  

  

 in light of these accomplishments the compensation committee determined to award annual cash incentives to mr thomson and mr singh at 100 and 120 of their target amounts respectively the actual amount of annual cash incentive paid for fiscal 2013 for each of messrs thomson and singh which was prorated to reflect each officer’s employment commencement date is set forth in the summary compensation table below 

fiscal 2014 annual cash incentive compensation 

in september 2013 the compensation committee approved a framework for the company’s 2014 annual cash incentive program the “2014 annual cash incentive” the compensation committee determined that twothirds of the 2014 annual cash incentive would be based on achievement of target adjusted total segment ebitda of the company and onethird would be based on an assessment of qualitative considerations the committee believes that this mix of quantitative and qualitative factors focuses management on the achievement of critical operating goals of the business while also rewarding the executive officers for their individual contributions in 

  

achieving strategic objectives the compensation committee selected adjusted total segment ebitda as the financial performance metric because the committee believes that this metric reflects the company’s key financial objective for the operations for which the executive officers have direct responsibility the committee also determined that it would consider based on a recommendation from the audit committee of its assessment of management’s performance on ethics and compliance objectives whether a reduction to the qualitative portion of the 2014 annual cash incentive payout is appropriate and if so the amount of such reduction 

for fiscal 2014 the compensation committee did not make any changes to the target annual cash incentive opportunities for messrs thomson and singh prior to the separation the fox compensation committee approved a fiscal 2014 target annual cash incentive opportunity of 2000000 for mr kr murdoch for his service as the company’s executive chairman
