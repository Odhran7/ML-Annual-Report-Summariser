competition 

we face competition across our lines of business on a global multinational national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2021 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets property types and services we face competition from other global national regional and local commercial real estate service providers companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded into other outsourcing offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments and property ownersdevelopers that selfperform real estate services investment banking firms investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital accountingconsulting firms that advise on real estate strategies and providers of flexible officespace solutions that offer space directly to the occupier 

despite ongoing consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are some of them are larger on a regional or localmarket basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as jones lang lasalle incorporated jll cushman  wakefield plc colliers international group inc savills plc and newmark group inc marketsegment specialists such as eastdil secured marcus  millichap inc and walker  dunlop inc firms with business lines that compete with some business lines within our occupier outsourcing business such as iss and sodexo sa firms engaged in project management such as arcadis and aecom and firms that provide flexible officespace solutions such as wework iwgregusspaces and knotel these flexible space providers also compete directly with industrious in which we hold a 40  noncontrolling interest 

seasonality 

in a typical year a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities have tended to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic may cause seasonality to deviate from historical patterns

material governmental matters 

environment 

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry in general and us environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines 

environmental sustainability 

we have developed measurable environmental and sustainability goals for 2035 grounded in science and an assessment of where our operations have the most significant impact on the environment as well as the areas where we can most effectively mitigate that impact these include goals to reduce scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 68 from the 2019 base year additional information about our approach to corporate social responsibility and to environmental social and governance esg issues is available on our corporate responsibility website httpswwwcbrecomaboutuscorporateresponsibilityoverview including the cbre corporate responsibility report the contents of our website and corporate responsibility report are referenced for general information only and are not incorporated in this annual report on form 10k

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that could later become material may also adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business environment 

our performance is significantly related to general economic political and regulatory conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity constraints significant public health events fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve 

periods of economic weakness or recession fiscal or political uncertainty market volatility declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may materially and negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines 

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we operate adverse economic conditions political or regulatory uncertainty and significant public health events can result in declines in real estate sale and leasing volumes and the value of commercial real estate it may also lead to a decrease in funds invested in commercial real estate assets and development projects such developments in turn may reduce our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities for example during the onset of the covid19 pandemic commercial real estate markets globally were severely impacted by a sharp decline in economic activity due to the spread of covid19 which put downward pressure on certain parts of our business see “ risks related to our operations—the covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and the extent to which it will continue to do so and its impact on our future financial results are uncertain ” below for additional risks related to the covid19 pandemic our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions or the perception that such disruptions may occur that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty 

we also make coinvestments alongside our investor clients in our development and investment management businesses during an economic downturn capital for our investment activities could be constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or sale prices we achieve may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the volume of loans our capital markets business originates andor services fees within our property management business are generally based on a percentage of rent collections making them sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that negatively impact rent collections and the performance of the properties we manage 

economic political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global landscape make it difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future as a result any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on thencurrent conditions and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate 

adverse developments in the credit markets may materially harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our investment management development services and capital markets including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as financial liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate markets 

disruptions in the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to obtain credit on favorable terms there may be fewer property leasing disposition and acquisition transactions in addition under such conditions our investment management and development services businesses may be unable to attract capital or achieve returns sufficient to earn incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if any such disruption causes a prolonged decline in the value of investments made 

our operations are subject to social political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 43 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 

in addition international economic trends foreign governmental policy actions and the following factors may have a material adverse effect on the performance of our business 

• difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies languages and cultures 

• currency restrictions transferpricing regulations and adverse tax consequences which may affect our ability to transfer capital and profits 

• adverse changes in regulatory or tax requirements and regimes or uncertainty about the application of or the future of such regulatory or tax requirements and regimes 

• responsibility for complying with numerous potentially conflicting and frequently complex and changing laws in multiple jurisdictions  eg  with respect to data protection privacy regulations corrupt practices embargoes trade sanctions employment and licensing 

• the impact of regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability including those related to public health or safety events 

• greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable or delays in client payments in some geographic regions 

• foreign ownership restrictions in certain countries particularly in asia pacific and the middle east or the risk that such restrictions will be adopted in the future and 

• changes in laws or policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards multinational companies as a result of any such changes to laws or policies as well as other geopolitical risks 

we maintain anticorruption and antimoneylaundering compliance programs throughout the company as well as programs designed to enable us to comply with any potential government economic sanctions embargoes or other importexport controls however coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or material civil sanctions and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have established operations and seek to grow our presence in many emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there 

risks related to our operations 

the covid19 pandemic has impacted our business operations and the extent to which it will continue to do so and its impact on our future financial results are uncertain 

the emergence of the covid19 pandemic initially resulted in a decline in real estate sales financing construction and leasing activity adversely impacting deal volume in our property sales and leasing activity in our advisory services segment there has since been a sharp economic and commercial real estate recovery however the pandemic has resulted in changes to the utilization of many types of commercial real estate for example the covid19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of hybrid and remote work schemes which may lead to reduced corporate office space requirements in the future the covid19 pandemic has also fueled increased demand for logistics and distribution facilities these shifts in commercial utilization may have an adverse effect on portions of our business while benefiting others for example reduced office space requirements could negatively impact office sales and leasing while higher demand for industrial and logistics properties could benefit industrial sales and leasing we would expect a similar shift to be reflected in other business lines as well should these structural demand shifts persist there can be no assurance however that any such beneficial demand shifts would be sufficient to substantially mitigate the adverse effects of such shifts on other portions of our business or the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic on our business results of operations and performance on a consolidated basis 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will impact our business and financial results in the future will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic the emergence and virulence of new variants which may cause and impact the severity of additional outbreaks governmental business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic how quickly and to what extent normal economic activity resumes the availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments for covid19 globally the effect on our clients and client demand for our services our ability to provide our services on a competitive basis including as a result of travel restrictions the remote work environment and staffing changes due to additional financial family and health burdens that may negatively impact our people’s mental and physical health engagement and retention the ability of our clients to pay for our services the acceleration of secular changes in the use of certain commercial real estate and any closures of our or our clients’ offices and facilities the situation continues to change rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this annual report 

we have numerous local regional and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future competition 

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including property management facilities management project and transaction management tenant and landlord leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and structured finance flexible space solutions real estate investment management valuation loan servicing development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2021 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines 

depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate services providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments developers flexible space providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions 

although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve in addition disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively furthermore we are substantially dependent on longterm client relationships and on revenue received for services under various service agreements many of these agreements may be canceled by the client for any reason with as little as 30 to 60 days’ notice as is typical in the industry 

in this competitive market if we are unable to maintain longterm client relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients our business results of operations andor financial condition may be materially adversely affected there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

our growth and financial performance have benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future 

acquisitions have accounted for a significant component of our growth over time any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices terms and conditions as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions which could increase the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt acquisitions involve risks that business judgments made concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove to be incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which could include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be costly and may adversely impact our business and the acquired company’s business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of accounting and information technology systems 

we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits but the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions are subject to a number of uncertainties including the ability to timely realize accretive benefits the level of attrition from professionals licensed or associated with the acquired companies and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business financial condition and operating results 

our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 

our brand and reputation are key assets and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices management workplace culture financial condition our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including handling of complaints regulatory compliance such as compliance with government sanctions the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other antibribery antimoney laundering and corruption laws the use and protection of client and other sensitive information and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct furthermore as a company with headquarters and operations located in the us a negative perception of the us arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand abroad although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity would materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our 

brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by the actions of third parties that are outside of our control including vendors and joint venture partners 

the protection of our brand including related trademarks may require the expenditure of significant financial and operational resources moreover the steps we take to protect our brand may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks even when we detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks any unauthorized use by third parties of our brand may adversely affect our brand furthermore as we continue to expand our business especially internationally there is a risk we may face claims of infringement or other alleged violations of thirdparty intellectual property rights which may restrict us from leveraging our brand in a manner consistent with our business goals 

our real estate investments businesses including our real estate investment programs and coinvestment activities subject us to performance and real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flow and impact our ability to raise capital for future investments 

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our investment management business line within our real estate investments segment can be volatile primarily because the management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements in the event that any of the investment programs that our investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2021 we had coinvested approximately 2324 million and had committed 1271 million to fund future coinvestments in our real estate investments segment approximately 426 million of which is expected to be funded during 2022 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our investment management line of business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments 

selective investment in real estate projects is critical to our development services business strategy within our real estate investments segment and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2021 we were involved as a principal in 26 real estate projects that were consolidated in our financial statements with invested equity of 4393 million and coinvested with our clients in approximately 125 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 2190 million we had committed additional capital of 407 million to the unconsolidated subsidiaries and of 1416 million to consolidated projects as of december 31 2021 

during the ordinary course of business within our development services business line we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

the success of our global workplace solutions segment depends on our ability to enter into mutually beneficial contracts deliver high quality levels of service and accurately assess working capital requirements 

contracts for our global workplace solutions clients often include complex terms regarding payment of fees risk transfer liability limitations termination due diligence and transition timeframes further the facilities management and project management businesses within our global workplace solutions segment are often impacted by transition activities in the first year of a contract as well as the timing of starting operations on these large client contracts if we are unable to negotiate contracts with our clients in a timely manner and on mutually beneficial terms or there is a delay in becoming fully operational our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted further if we fail to deliver the highquality levels of service expected by our clients it may result in reputational and financial damage and could impact our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 

our global workplace solutions segment also requires us to accurately model the working capital needs of this business should we fail to accurately assess working capital requirements the cash flow generated by this business may be adversely impacted in addition if we do not accurately assess the creditworthiness of a client or if a client’s creditworthiness changes during the term of the contract we could potentially be unable to collect on any outstanding payments 

a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business depends upon our relationships with us government sponsored enterprises 

a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business which we conduct through certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries depends upon our relationship with the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac collectively the government sponsored enterprises gses as an approved sellerservicer for the gses we are required to comply with various eligibility criteria and are required to originate and service loans in accordance with their individual program requirements  including participation in loss sharing and repurchase arrangements failure to comply with these requirements may result in termination or withdrawal of our approval to sell and service the gse loans 

a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in economic and reputational harm to us 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to perform activities on behalf of our organization to improve quality increase efficiencies cut costs and lower operational risks across our business and support functions we have instituted a supplier code of conduct which is intended to communicate to our vendors the standards of conduct we expect them to uphold our contracts with vendors typically impose a contractual obligation to comply with our supplier code of conduct in addition we leverage technology to help us better screen vendors with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of the compliance data privacy health and safety environmental sustainability and other risks posed to our business by potential and existing vendors if our third parties do not have the proper safeguards and controls in place or appropriate oversight cannot be provided we could be exposed to increased operational regulatory financial or reputational risks a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees while certain of our executive officers and key employees are subject to longterm compensatory arrangements there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all key members of our senior management we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to materially suffer competition for employee talent is intense and increasing and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business if we were to experience significant employee attrition or turnover it could lead to increased recruitment and training costs as well as operating 

inefficiencies that could adversely impact our results of operation we and our competitors use equity incentives and signon and retention bonuses to help attract retain and incentivize key personnel as competition is significant for the services of such personnel the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase which could negatively impact our profitability or result in our inability to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could materially suffer 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our global operations we might be unable to achieve our business objectives  

our global operations present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals the size of our employee base increases the possibility that we will have individuals who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to business and reputational risks if we are not successful in continuing to develop and implement the processes and tools designed to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our reputation and ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change if we do not successfully implement any such changes our business and results of operation may be negatively and materially impacted 

our policies procedures and programs to safeguard the health safety and security of our employees and others may not be adequate 

we have more than 105000 employees excluding turner  townsend employees as well as independent contractors working in over 100 countries we have undertaken to implement what we believe to be best practices to safeguard the health safety and security of our employees independent contractors clients and others at our worksites however if these policies procedures and programs are not adequate or employees do not receive related adequate training or follow them for any reason the consequences may be severe to us including serious injury or loss of life which could impair our operations and cause us to incur significant legal liability or fines as well as reputational damage our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover any legal liability or fines that we incur for health safety or security incidents 

we may be subject to actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

similar to other global services companies with different business lines and a broad client base we may be subject to potential conflicts of interests in the provision of our services for example conflicts may arise from our role in advising or representing both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions in certain cases we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our clients in such situations our policies are designed to give full disclosure and transparency to all parties as well as implement appropriate barriers on informationsharing and other activities to ensure each party’s interests are protected however there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in every case if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations there could be an adverse effect on our business or reputation regardless of whether any such claims have merit in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that potential conflicts of interest will not materially adversely affect us 

infrastructure disruptions may disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients 

our ability to conduct a global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located this may include disruptions as a result of political instability public health crises attacks on our information technology systems terrorist attacks interruptions or delays in services from thirdparty data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers employee errors or malfeasance building defects utility outages the effects of climate change and natural disasters such as fires earthquakes floods and hurricanes the infrastructure disruptions we may experience as a result of such events could also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of our real estate investments in our investment management and development services businesses 

the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by people daily we also manage the critical facilities including data centers that our clients rely on to serve the public and their customers where unplanned downtime could potentially disrupt other parts of their businesses or society as a result fires earthquakes floods hurricanes other natural disasters building defects terrorist attacks mass shootings or infrastructure disruptions can result in significant loss of life or injury and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm 

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could materially harm our business 

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the us and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly 

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business political economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter particularly those that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a proportionally larger effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

as of december 31 2021 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 our interest expense was 683 million 

our debt instruments impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

• plan for or react to market conditions 

• meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and 

• finance ongoing operations strategic acquisitions investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest including 

◦ incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness 

◦ entering into mergers and consolidations 

◦ creating liens and 

◦ entering into saleleaseback transactions 

our credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt as defined in the credit agreement less available cash as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated ebitda as of the end of each fiscal quarter our ability to meet these financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments 

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness in addition in the event of a creditratings downgrade our ability to borrow and the costs of such borrowings could be adversely affected 

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments in addition moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades of them may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings 

risks related to our information technology cybersecurity and data protection 

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market 

our business relies heavily on information technology including solutions provided by third parties to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients if we are unable to effectively execute or maintain our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform our ability to deliver highquality services may be materially impaired in addition we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays or fail to exploit new technologies then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted similarly our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business failure to successfully provide such tools and systems or ensure that employees have properly adopted them could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes 

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results 

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or our infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyberattacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism employee errors or malfeasance or other events which are beyond our control with respect to cyberattacks and viruses these pose growing threats to many companies and we have been a target and may continue to be a target of such threats which could expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm to our business and financial results in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients contractors and vendors and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel furthermore while we have certain business interruption and cyber insurance coverage and various contractual arrangements that can serve to mitigate costs damages and liabilities any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers business partners and other third parties we have crises management business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers and thirdparty cloud hosting providers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected 

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information intellectual property and proprietary business information could materially adversely affect us 

security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks as well as that of thirdparty vendors could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs which could cause material harm to our business and financial results in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees contractors and vendors in our data centers networks and thirdparty cloud hosting providers the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations although we and our vendors continue to implement new security measures and regularly conduct employee training our information technology and infrastructure may nevertheless be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third 

parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions an increasing number of companies that rely on information and technology networks have disclosed breaches of their security some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target to date we have not yet experienced any cybersecurity breaches that have been material either individually or in the aggregate however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent any material events from occurring in the future 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect sensitive information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation china’s cyber security laws various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information including the california consumer privacy act and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations are increasing in severity complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us 

a significant actual or potential theft loss corruption exposure fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients harm our relationships with contractors and vendors damage our reputation result in the loss of a competitive advantage impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting which could adversely affect our business revenues competitive position and investor confidence additionally we rely on third parties to support our information and technology networks including cloud storage solution providers and as a result have less direct control over our data and information technology systems such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation 

legal and regulatory related risks 

we are subject to various litigation and regulatory risks and may face financial liabilities andor damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or regulatory investigations or proceedings 

our businesses are exposed to various litigation and regulatory risks especially within our valuations business although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures additionally our insurance policies may not cover us in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct accordingly an adverse result in a litigation against us or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore an adverse result in regulatory proceedings if applicable could result in fines or other liabilities or adversely impact our operations prolonged or complex investigations even if they do not result in regulatory or other proceedings or adverse findings may result in significant costs that may not be covered by insurance and in diversion of employee resources in addition we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients as a result allegations against us or the announcement of a regulatory investigation involving us irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation or investigation may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects 

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes we may incur material financial penalties 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including 

the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre investment management are subject to regulation by the sec financial industry regulatory authority finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental employment laws and antibribery antimoney laundering and corruption laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations us state wageandhour laws the us fcpa and the uk bribery act failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters 

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have both increased new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the us as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

exposure to additional tax liabilities and changes in tax laws and regulations or could adversely affect our financial results 

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter 

in addition changes in tax laws or regulations including developments arising from proposed us tax legislation the final form of which is uncertain and multijurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd increase tax uncertainty and could impact the company’s effective tax rate and provision for income taxes given the unpredictability of possible further changes to and the potential interdependency of the united states or foreign tax laws and regulations it is difficult to predict the cumulative effect of such tax laws and regulations on the company’s results of operations 

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business 

risks related to our internal controls and accounting policies 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls as disclosed in part ii item 9a during the fourth quarter of 2019 management identified several material weaknesses in internal control related to our global workplace solutions segment in the europe middle east  africa region or gws emea we made significant progress during the prior and the current fiscal year and remediated certain material weaknesses even though a material misstatement was not identified in the gws emea financial statements it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the gws emea revenue  receivables and journal entries would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis and therefore management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2021 internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner or are otherwise unable to maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our stock price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired which may require us to take material noncash charges against earnings 

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

risks related to our investments 

we have equity investments in certain companies that we do not control which subject us to risks related to their respective businesses 

as of december 31 2021 we had 12 billion invested in unconsolidated subsidiaries that were accounted for under the cost method of accounting equity method or fair value this included 368 million associated with our investment in altus power inc which merged with a spac that we sponsored these investments are subject to risks related to the businesses in which we invest which may be different than the risks inherent in our own business factors beyond our control can significantly influence the value of these investments and may cause their fair value to decrease or adversely impact our ability to recognize a gain on such investments these factors include decisions made by management or controlling stockholders of such businesses who may have interests different than those of cbre and instability in the capital markets any of these factors among others could cause realized andor unrealized losses in future periods which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the future we may acquire more equity investments that are not consolidated and may sponsor additional spacs which could increase our exposure to the risks described above

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2021 we occupied offices excluding affiliates in the following geographical regions 



 

1 includes 99 offices acquired as part of turner  townsend including 21 in the americas 46 in emea and 32 offices in apac regions 

some of our offices house employees from more than one of our business segments ie an office might house employees from all three of our business segments as such we have provided the above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting or triple counting our offices 

we do not own any material real property and generally lease our office space and believe it is adequate for our current needs the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic areas our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business we believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefore as liabilities on our consolidated financial statements are unlikely to be significant but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is designed to provide the reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition results of operations liquidity and certain other factors that may affect future results this mda should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2019 and comparisons between the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 is included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the company’s annual report filed with the sec on february 24 2021 

overview 

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm based on 2021 revenue with leading global market positions in our leasing property sales occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses as of december 31 2021 the company has more than 105000 employees excluding turner  townsend employees serving clients in more than 100 countries 

we provide services to real estate investors and occupiers for investors our services include capital markets property sales mortgage origination sales and servicing property leasing investment management property management valuation and development services among others for occupiers our services include facilities management project management transaction both property sales and leasing and consulting services among others we provide services under the following brand names “cbre” real estate advisory and outsourcing services “cbre investment management” investment management “trammell crow company” us development “telford homes” uk development and “turner  townsend holdings limited” during 2020 cbre sponsored a special purpose acquisition company or spac cbre acquisition holdings inc which merged with and into altus power inc a leading provider of solar energy for commercial and industrial properties altus power inc altus began trading on the new york stock exchange nyse on december 10 2021 under the ticker symbol “amps” 

we generate revenue from both stable recurring large multiyear portfolio and per project contracts and more cyclical nonrecurring sources including commissions on transactions our revenue mix has become heavily weighted towards stable revenue sources particularly occupier outsourcing with our dependence on highly cyclical property sales and lease transaction revenue declining markedly we believe we are wellpositioned to capture a substantial and growing share of market opportunities at a time when investors and occupiers increasingly prefer to purchase integrated accountbased services on a national and global basis 

in 2021 we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients including more than 93 of the fortune 100 companies we have been an sp 500 company since 2006 and in 2021 we were ranked 122 on the fortune 500 we have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the lipsey company survey for 21 years in a row including 2021 we have also been rated a world’s most ethical company by the ethisphere institute for eight consecutive years including 2021 the most recent year the award has been announced and included in the dow jones world sustainability index for three years in a row and the bloomberg genderequality index for three years in a row 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

to recognize revenue in a transaction with a customer we evaluate the five steps of the accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue recognition framework 1 identify the contract 2 identify the performance obligationss in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and 5 recognize revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied 

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five step framework understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time amount and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires significant judgement these significant judgements include i determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer ii applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time iii estimating how and when contingencies or other forms of variable consideration will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue and iv determining whether we control third party services before they are transferred to the customer in order to appropriately recognize the associated fees on either a gross or net basis the timing and amount of revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue incentivebased management fees development fees and third party fees associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management services for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

business combinations goodwill and other intangible assets 

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill deferred consideration arrangements granted in connection with a business combination are evaluated to determine whether all or a portion is in substance additional purchase price or compensation for services additional purchase price is added to the fair value of consideration transferred in the business combination and compensation is included in operating expenses in the period it is incurred in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews 

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in accordance with asc topic 350 “ intangibles – goodwill and other ” topic 350 we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of our reporting units to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is needed we are permitted to assess based on qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test if not we do not need to apply the quantitative test the qualitative test is elective and we can go directly to the quantitative test rather than making a morelikelythannot assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors when performing a quantitative test we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2021 and 2020 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items 

see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes 

new accounting pronouncements 

see new accounting pronouncements discussion within note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

the sec issued release no 3310890 “management’s discussion and analysis selected financial data supplementary financial information” which became fully effective on august 9 2021 this release was adopted to modernize simplify and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements in regulation sk specifically the requirement for selected financial data was eliminated the requirement to disclose supplementary financial information was streamlined and certain elements of required mda disclosures were amended these amendments are intended to eliminate duplicative disclosures and modernize and enhance mda disclosures for the benefit of investors while simplifying compliance efforts for registrants 

with our adoption of this release we have applied the required amendments where applicable to form 10k for the year ended december 31 2021 

seasonality 

in a typical year a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities have tended to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic may cause seasonality to deviate from historical patterns 

inflation 

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by inflation for example input costs for construction materials in our development business have increased as a result of inflation related to supply chain issues and worker shortages respectively however these increases have been more than offset by rising property values we believe that our business has significant inherent protections against inflation and to date general inflation has not had a material impact upon our operations the company continues to monitor inflation potential monetary policy changes in response to high inflation and potentially adverse effects to our business from either higher inflation or interest rates or both 

items affecting comparability 

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties particularly those caused or exacerbated by covid19 that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

macroeconomic conditions 

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth with specific sensitivity to growth in officebased employment interest rate levels and changes in interest rates the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business 

compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effects on our operating margins of difficult market conditions such as the environment that prevailed in the early months of the covid19 pandemic are partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe like during the current covid19 pandemic we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance additionally our contractual revenue has increased primarily as a result of growth in our outsourcing business and we believe this contractual revenue should help offset the negative impacts that macroeconomic deterioration could have on other parts of our business we also believe that we have significantly improved the resiliency of our business through a fourdimension diversification strategy that expanded the business strategically across asset types clients geographies and lines of business nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our consolidated operations and financial condition 

effects of acquisitions and investments 

we have historically made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service capabilities around the world on november 1 2021 we acquired a 60 controlling ownership interest in turner  townsend holdings limited turner  townsend we believe that this partnership will help us advance our diversification strategy across four dimensions including asset types lines of business clients and geographies turner  townsend is a leading professional services company specializing in program management project management cost and commercial management and advisory services across the real estate infrastructure and natural resources sectors and is consolidated and reported in our global workplace solutions segment turner  townsend was acquired for £9600 million or 13 billion along with the acquisition of 440 million £322 million in cash the turner  townsend acquisition was funded with cash on hand and gross deferred purchase consideration of 5912 million £4320 million 

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform or independent affiliates which in some cases we held a small equity interest in early 2022 we acquired a spanish project management company 

during 2021 we completed eight infill acquisitions a us firm that provides construction and project management services a professional service advisory firm in australia a us firm focused on investment banking and investment sales in the global gaming real estate market a leading facilities management firm in the netherlands a workplace interior design and project management company in singapore a property management firm in france a residential brokerage in the netherlands and an occupancy management company based in the us 

during 2020 we completed six infill acquisitions leading local facilities management firms in spain and italy a us firm that helps companies reduce telecommunications costs a technologyfocused project management firm based in florida a firm specializing in performing real estate valuations in south korea and a facilities management and technical maintenance firm in australia 

also during 2021 we made an incremental investment in industrious a leading provider of premium flexible workplace solutions in the us bringing its current noncontrolling ownership stake to 40 as part of this investment we contributed hana our legacy flexible office space business into industrious during the fourth quarter of 2021 our companysponsored spac merged with and into altus power inc our investment in common shares of altus and related interests were approximately 368 million at december 31 2021 

we believe strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position – or expand our capabilities – within targeted markets or business lines in general however most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating income and net income as a result of transactionrelated expenditures including severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs as well as costs and charges associated with integrating the acquired business and integrating its financial and accounting systems into our own 

our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase consideration in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2021 we have accrued deferred purchase and contingent considerations totaling 6301 million which is included in “accounts payable and accrued expenses” and in “other longterm liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

international operations 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally our real estate investments business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe in addition our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies such as the euro and british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

our businesses could suffer from the effects of public health crises such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic political or economic disruptions or the perception that such disruptions may occur that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty 

during the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 43 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies dollars in thousands 



 

1 approximately 48 currencies comprise 70 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 and approximately 40 currencies comprise 69 of our revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 

although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results for example we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2021 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 83 million had the eurotous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2021 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 181 million these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into us dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 dollars in thousands 



 

1 see discussion in segment operations for organization changes effective january 1 2021 prior period results have been recast to conform with these changes 

2 in conjunction with the acquisition of a 60 interest in turner  townsend in the fourth quarter of 2021 we modified our definition of consolidated adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit sop to be inclusive of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and have recast prior periods to conform to this definition the attribution of adjusted ebitda and sop to noncontrolling interests for prior periods was deemed to be materially the same as net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in such periods 

net revenue and consolidated adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use these measures in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we generally use these nongaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected costs and charges that may obscure the underlying performance of our business and related trends because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of net revenue and consolidated adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

net revenue is gross revenue less costs largely associated with subcontracted vendor work performed for clients and generally has no margin prior to 2021 the company utilized fee revenue to analyze the overall financial performance fee revenue excluded additional reimbursed costs primarily related to employees dedicated to clients some of which included minimal margin 

we use consolidated adjusted ebitda as an indicator of consolidated financial performance it represents earnings before the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests net interest expense writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt income taxes depreciation and amortization asset impairments adjustments related to certain carried interest incentive compensation expense reversal to align with the timing of associated revenue fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the telford acquisition purchase accounting that were sold in the period costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring costs associated with workforce optimization transformation initiatives and integration and other costs related to acquisitions we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending 

consolidated adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments this measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt we also use consolidated adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs 

consolidated adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows dollars in thousands 



 

1 during 2020 management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs streamline operations and support future growth the majority of expenses incurred were cash in nature and primarily related to employee separation benefits lease termination costs and professional fees see note 21 of our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2021 increased by 39 billion or 165 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 overall revenue generated by the advisory services segment increased by 327 primarily due to a notable rebound in sales and lease revenue as we continue to recover from the impacts of the pandemic across our major markets the increase was also due to an uptick in revenue from our commercial mortgage origination and loan servicing line of business primarily driven by an active private lending market revenue generated by our global workplace solutions segment increased 82 as compared to 2020 led by growth in our facilities management line of business driven by its contractual nature and also in the project management space supported by turner  townsend which contributed approximately 1940 million in total revenue our asset under management aum portfolio grew substantially during the year contributing to an increase in asset management fees in our real estate investments segment revenue generated from sales in our development service line of business increased dramatically this year as we continue to recover from market activity that was generally suppressed due to the pandemic last year foreign currency translation had a 20 positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 primarily driven by strength in the canadian dollar british pound sterling and euro partially offset by weakness in the argentine peso and brazilian real 

our cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 25 billion or 133 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global workplace solutions segment due to growth in our facilities management and project management business and higher costs associated with our advisory services segment primarily due to significant growth in our sales and leasing business foreign currency translation had a 20 negative impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased from 799 for the year ended december 31 2020 to 778 for the year ended december 31 2021 this was primarily driven by an increase in the real estate investment segment investment management 

fees due to growth in aum that does not have an associated cost of revenue as well as a shift in the overall composition of revenue with advisory services contributing more to current year revenue than it did last year 

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 7680 million or 232 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 139 for the year ended december 31 2020 to 147 for the year ended december 31 2021 the increase was primarily due to higher integration and other acquisition costs primarily due to the turner  townsend acquisition higher expenses associated with maintenance of our operational infrastructure and an increase in overall compensation expense including support staff compensation and related benefits overall bonus accrual and stock compensation expense which are primarily tied to significant improvement in the business performance for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 this was partially offset by lower expenses associated with bad debt write off and associated provision expenses foreign currency translation also had a 21 negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 241 million or 48 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 this increase was primarily attributable to accelerated amortization of mortgage servicing rights due to early loan payoffs in our loan servicing business line in addition we recorded approximately 197 million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to definitelived intangibles identified as part of the turner  townsend acquisition 

we did not record any asset impairments during the year ended december 31 2021 our asset impairments on a consolidated basis totaled 887 million during the year ended december 31 2020 and consisted of a 502 million of noncash asset impairment charges in our global workplace solutions segment a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 250 million and noncash asset impairment charges of 135 million in our real estate investments segment these impairments were recorded primarily due to triggering events associated with covid19 

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis decreased by 168 million or 191 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 these gains resulted from decreased activity related to property sales on consolidated deals within our real estate investments segment 

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 4925 million or 3904 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with property sales reported in our real estate investments segment our positive fair value adjustment related to our investment in industrious and higher equity earnings associated with certain noncontrolling equity investments reported in our corporate and other segment 

our other income on a consolidated basis was 2036 million for the year ended december 31 2021 versus 174 million for the same period in the prior year the increase was primarily due to a noncash gain of 1875 million that was recorded as part of the deconsolidation of cbre acquisition holdings upon its merger with and into altus power inc at which point we recorded our equity investment and related interests in altus at fair value 

our consolidated interest expense net of interest income decreased by 174 million or 257 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 this decrease was primarily due to interest expense associated with the 525 senior note which was fully paid off in december 31 2020 and offset by interest expense associated with a favorable term 2500 senior note issued in march 2021 

we did not incur any writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 756 million for the year ended december 31 2020 the costs for the year ended december 31 2020 included a 736 million premium paid and the writeoff of 20 million of unamortized premium and debt issuance costs in connection with the redemption in full of the 4250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 525 senior notes 

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 5675 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to 2141 million for the same period in 2020 our effective tax rate increased from 220 for the year ended december 31 2020 to 236 for the year ended december 31 2021 the increase is primarily due to an increase in the provision for state income taxes net of federal benefit and a decrease of tax credits in 2021

year ended december 31 2021 compared to year ended december 31 2020 

revenue increased by 2602 million or 313 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by an increase in real estate sales in our development services line of business primarily in the uk as we bounce back from the pandemic and an increase in investment management fees related to growth in aum slightly muted by lower carried interest than the year before foreign currency translation had a 43 positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 primarily driven by strength in the british pound sterling and euro 

cost of revenue increased by 1759 million or 1014 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by an increase in real estate development which is consistent with an increase in sales in our development service line of business foreign currency translation had a 77 negative impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31 2021 

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 2873 million or 472 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in general compensation and related benefits incentive compensation and bonuses in our development services and investment management line of business consistent with higher revenue growth foreign currency translation had a 28 negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2021 

equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries increased by 4318 million or 3495 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with property sales reported in the development line of business 

a roll forward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31 2021 is as follows dollars in billions 



aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide or participate in oversight investment management services and other advice and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market not the basis for determining our management fees our assets under management consist of 

• the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either whollyowned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing committed but unfunded capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our aum the value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost in the case of real estate operating companies the total value of real properties controlled by the companies generally through joint ventures is included in aum and 

• the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios including investments which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments 

our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers 

corporate and other 

our corporate segment primarily consists of corporate overhead costs other consists of activities from strategic noncore noncontrolling equity investments and is considered an operating segment but does not meet the aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment and is therefore combined with corporate and reported as corporate and other the following table summarizes our results of operations for our corporate and other segment for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 dollars in thousands 



 

1 percentage of revenue calculations are not meaningful and therefore not included 

2 primarily represents costs incurred related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management’s cost containment efforts in response to the covid19 pandemic the charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort and were included in the “operating administrative and other” line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 

3 during 2020 management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs streamline operations and support future growth the majority of expenses incurred were cash in nature and primarily related to employee separation benefits lease termination costs and professional fees see note 21 of our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

operating administrative and other expenses were approximately 4524 million during the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 362 as compared to the prior year this was primarily due to an increase in general compensation and related benefits as well as in stock compensation expense bonus and other incentive compensation expense primarily tied to the overall profitability of the organization in addition operating expenses associated with our sponsorship of cbre acquisitions holdings inc now known as altus power inc up until its merger with and into altus on december 9 2021 were also recorded in this segment 

equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries was approximately 369 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 this was primarily due to elevated capital markets activity coupled with mark to market adjustments for investments where the fair value option has been elected we recorded favorable fair value adjustments on our noncontrolling investments including a 65 million fair value adjustment on our equity investment and related interests in altus from the merger date through december 31 2021 the valuation of common shares private placement warrants and alignment shares are dependent on altus’ stock price which could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various market conditions 

other income of 2058 million is primarily comprised of 1875 million in noncash gain that was recorded as part of our deconsolidation of cbre acquisition holdings inc upon it merging with and into altus as part of this transaction we recorded our interest in altus’ alignment shares and private placement warrants at fair value which factored into the recognition of the above gain the remaining activity relates to unrealized and realized gainloss on equity and available for sale debt securities owned by our whollyowned captive insurance company and our noncontrolling interest in additional equity securities 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2022 include up to approximately 305 million of anticipated capital expenditures net of tenant concessions during the year ended december 31 2021 we incurred 1787 million of capital expenditures net of tenant concessions received which includes approximately 363 million related to technology enablement as of december 31 2021 we had aggregate commitments of 1271 million to fund future coinvestments in our real estate investments business 426 million of which is expected to be funded in 2022 additionally as of december 31 2021 we are committed to fund additional capital of 407 million and 1416 million to unconsolidated subsidiaries and to consolidated projects respectively within our real estate investments business as of december 31 2021 we had 32 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and 23 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use 

we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and general investment requirements including strategic infill acquisitions and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future and at a minimum for the next 12 months given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals are generally paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments as we have done in the past with new debt instruments at interest rates maturities and terms we deem attractive we may also from time to time in our sole discretion purchase redeem or retire our existing senior notes through tender offers in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise 

on december 28 2020 we redeemed the 4250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 525 senior notes due 2025 in full we funded this redemption using cash on hand in march 2021 we took advantage of favorable market conditions and low interest rates and conducted a new issuance for 5000 million in aggregate principal amount of 2500 senior notes due 2031 on november 23 2021 we redeemed the 3000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our tranche a term loan facility due 2024 in full we funded this redemption using cash on hand 

as noted above we believe that any future significant acquisitions we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions 

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are generally comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness if our cash flow is insufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

the second longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase consideration in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had accrued deferred purchase consideration totaling 6301 million 320 million of which was a current liability and 825 million 143 million of which was a current liability respectively which was included in “accounts payable and accrued expenses” and in “other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

lastly as described in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report in february 2019 our board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to 5000 million of our class a common stock over three years the 2019 program during the year ended december 31 2021 we repurchased 3122054 shares of our class a common stock at an average price of 9203 per share for 2873 million under the 2019 program as of december 31 2021 we had 627 million of capacity remaining under the 2019 program 

in november 2021 our board of directors authorized a new program for the company to repurchase up to 20 billion of our class a common stock over five years effective november 19 2021 the 2021 program during the year ended december 31 2021 we spent 856 million to repurchase 832315 shares of our class a common stock at an average price of 10282 per share using cash on hand as of december 31 2021 we had 19 billion of capacity remaining under the 2021 program for a total capacity of approximately 198 billion as of february 17 2022 we had 191 billion of total capacity remaining under the above programs 

our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash we may utilize our stock repurchase programs to continue offsetting the impact of our stockbased compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses the timing of any future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions and other factors

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 24 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 05 billion as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the primary drivers that contributed to the net increase were as follows  the company’s net income more than doubled in 2021 as compared to 2020 this was partially muted by certain key noncash items such as a 1875 million gain recognized upon deconsolidation of cbre acquisition holdings inc and higher equity income than distributions received from unconsolidated subsidiaries in addition there were some noncash charges during 2020 that did not occur in 2021 such as 887 million in asset impairment that are offsetting the net increase in operating cash activities for 2021 we also experienced a drag on our working capital which negatively impacted the overall increase in operating cash flows by approximately 3624 million this was primarily due to a significant increase in our trade receivables fueled by revenue growth but our cash collection efforts fell behind this was mitigated to some extent by an increase in accrued commission as our brokerage professionals are generally not paid until cash has been collected on the transaction additionally a smaller change in our real estate under development asset balance this year as compared to previous year contributed to the overall positive change in operating cash flow 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 13 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 5368 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 this increase was primarily driven by i our investment in industrious ii a significant increase in mergers and acquisitions related activities with the major one being turner  townsend and iii an investment of 2200 million in altus’ common shares the increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by an outflow from purchase of marketable securities from the spac trust account in 2020 of 4025 million versus a 2127 million inflow of proceeds from sale of marketable securities from the spac trust account in 2021 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 4906 million for the year ended december 31 2021 an increase of 2679 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was primarily due to an additional 3186 million that was used to repurchase shares during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to december 31 2020 as well as in 2021 a repayment of senior term loans of 3000 million and net payments of notes payable on real estate of 969 million this was partially offset by the net proceeds of 4923 million from the issuance of our 2500 senior notes during 2021 net cash used in financing activities during 2021 was also impacted by the payment of 2051 million for redemption of noncontrolling interest for cbre acquisition holdings inc and payment of deferred underwriting costs related to its initial public offering net cash used in financing in 2020 was impacted by our redemption in full of 525 senior notes in december 2020 partially offset by 3937 million in proceeds from the sale of noncontrolling interest from the spac

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply fasb asc topic 815 “ derivatives and hedging ” when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

exchange rates 

our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional reporting currency which is the us dollar see the discussion of international operations which is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “international operations” and is incorporated by reference herein 

interest rates 

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt historically we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2021 we do not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements 

the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 4518 million at december 31 2021 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair value of our 4875 and 2500 senior notes was 6717 million and 5021 million respectively at december 31 2021 

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2021 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 46 million on pretax income and a decrease of 46 million in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2021

 item 9a controls and procedures 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act the company’s management with participation of the ceo and cfo under the oversight of our board of directors evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 using the framework in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness towards future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the acquired controlling interest in turner  townsend holdings limited which was acquired in 2021 the amount of total assets and revenue included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2021 that is attributable to the acquired controlling interest in turner  townsend holdings limited was approximately 417 million and 194 million respectively 

based on the evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2021 due to the material weaknesses described below 

a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting kpmg llp’s report is included herein on page 56  

material weaknesses identified relating to global workplace solutions segment – europe middle east  africa region gws emea 

gws emea resources were not sufficiently trained to operate controls related to financial reporting risks resulting in process level controls that did not operate effectively in the revenue  receivables and journal entries processes these control deficiencies create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and therefore we conclude that the deficiencies represent material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and our internal control over financial reporting is not effective as of december 31 2021 

the company’s plan to remediate the material weaknesses 

the company with the oversight from the audit committee of the board of directors is committed to remediating the gws emea material weaknesses in a timely manner we are using both internal and external resources to assist in the remediation plan by continuing to train all relevant personnel involved in the revenue  receivables and journal entries processes 

our remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses are ongoing these material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls have been fully designed documented implemented and operate for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude through testing that these controls are operating effectively while we intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses in 2022 there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully complete the remediation within the contemplated timeline 

disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer “certifying officers” have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d 15e under the exchange act as of december 31 2021 our certifying officers concluded that as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described above our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2021 

rule 13a15 of the exchange act requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same this evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects the evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our sec reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the sec’s rules and forms any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives our chief executive officer and chief financial officer supervise and participate in this evaluation and they are assisted by members of our disclosure committee our disclosure committee consists of our general counsel our deputy cfo and chief accounting officer our chief transformation officer our chief communication officer our senior officers of significant business lines and other select employees 

in light of the material weaknesses described above management performed additional analysis and other procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap accordingly management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with gaap 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2021 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

remediation of previously reported material weaknesses relating to gws emea 

as previously reported management identified that the company had material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 related to its gws emea business which continued through december 31 2020 based on the company’s evaluation under the coso framework and excluding the material weaknesses described above management ensured that the root causes contributing to the previously reported material weaknesses were remediated such that the controls were designed implemented and operating effectively

competition 

we face competition across our lines of business on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2020 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets property types and services we face competition from other global national regional and local commercial real estate service providers companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded into other outsourcing offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments and property ownersdevelopers that selfperform real estate services investment banking firms investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital and accountingconsulting firms that advise on real estate strategies some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do 

despite ongoing consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are some of them are larger on a regional or localmarket basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as jones lang lasalle incorporated jll cushman  wakefield plc colliers international group inc savills plc and newmark group inc marketsegment specialists such as eastdil secured marcus  millichap inc and walker  dunlop inc and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business such as iss and sodexo sa in addition in recent years providers of flexible officespace solutions such as wework iwgregusspaces industrious national management company llc “industrious” and knotel have offered services directly to occupiers providing competition particularly for smaller space requirements these providers also compete directly with our flexiblespace solutions subsidiary hana 

seasonality 

in a typical year a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities have tended to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend the severe and ongoing impact of the novel coronavirus covid19 pandemic may cause seasonality to deviate from historical patterns

material governmental matters 

environment 

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a 

table of contents 

property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry in general and us environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this annual report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that could later become material may also adversely affect our business 

risks related to our business environment 

our performance is significantly related to general economic political and regulatory conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity constraints significant public health events fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve 

periods of economic weakness or recession fiscal or political uncertainty market volatility declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may materially and negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines 

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we operate adverse economic conditions political or regulatory uncertainty and significant public health events can result in declines in real estate sale and leasing volumes and the value of commercial real estate it may also lead to a decrease in funds invested in commercial real estate assets and development projects such developments in turn may reduce our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities 

for example during 2020 commercial real estate markets globally were severely impacted by a sharp decline in economic activity due to the spread of covid19 which put downward pressure on certain parts of our business see “the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition” below for additional risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions or the perception that such disruptions may occur that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty for example in 2020 uncertainty over the longterm economic and trade relationship between the uk and european union adversely impacted sales and leasing activity in the uk and may continue to adversely impact our business due to market and currency volatility and reduced economic activity 

we also make coinvestments alongside our investor clients in our development and investment management businesses during an economic downturn capital for our investment activities could be constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or sale prices we achieve may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the volume of loans our capital markets business originates andor services fees within our property management business are generally based on a percentage of rent collections making them sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that negatively impact rent collections and the performance of the properties we manage 

economic political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global landscape make it difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future as a result any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on thencurrent conditions and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate 

table of contents 

adverse developments in the credit markets may materially harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

our investment management development services and capital markets including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as financial liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate markets 

disruptions in the credit markets may have a material adverse effect on our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to obtain credit on favorable terms there may be fewer property leasing disposition and acquisition transactions in addition under such conditions our investment management and development services businesses may be unable to attract capital or achieve returns sufficient to earn incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a prolonged decline in the value of investments made 

our operations are subject to social political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 44 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 

in addition international economic trends foreign governmental policy actions and the following factors may have a material adverse effect on the performance of our business 

• difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies languages and cultures 

• currency restrictions transferpricing regulations and adverse tax consequences which may affect our ability to transfer capital and profits 

• adverse changes in regulatory or tax requirements and regimes or uncertainty about the application of or the future of such regulatory or tax requirements and regimes 

• responsibility for complying with numerous potentially conflicting and frequently complex and changing laws in multiple jurisdictions eg  with respect to data protection privacy regulations corrupt practices embargoes trade sanctions employment and licensing 

• the impact of regional or countryspecific business cycles and economic instability including those related to public health or safety events 

• greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable or delays in client payments in some geographic regions 

• foreign ownership restrictions in certain countries particularly in asia pacific and the middle east or the risk that such restrictions will be adopted in the future and 

• changes in laws or policies governing foreign trade or investment and use of foreign operations or workers and any negative sentiments towards multinational companies as a result of any such changes to laws or policies as well as other geopolitical risks 

we maintain anticorruption and antimoneylaundering compliance programs throughout the company as well as programs designed to enable us to comply with any potential government economic sanctions embargoes or other importexport controls however coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory 

table of contents 

environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or material civil sanctions and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have established operations and seek to grow our presence in many emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there 

risks related to our operations 

the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic has created significant economic and societal disruption which has adversely affected our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations cash flows and financial condition in 2020 the covid19 pandemic resulted in a decline in real estate sales financing construction and leasing activity adversely impacting deal volume in our property sales and leasing activity in our advisory services segment we expect this impact to continue in 2021 the continued spread of the covid19 pandemic may cause further economic weakness and may result in a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn may reduce our revenue from property commissions derived from property leasing sales valuation and financing as well as property management fees and other fees and revenues equity earnings and gains on asset sales associated with development or investment management activities it may also result in losses due to our participation in the government sponsored enterprise lending programs which require us to satisfy certain forbearance and loss sharingrepurchase obligations furthermore our investment management development services and capital markets including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit costs and availability as well as financial liquidity and dislocations in the capital markets related to the covid19 pandemic may adversely impact the performance of these businesses in addition if office workers continue to work from home after the covid19 crisis has passed it may alter the demand for office space particularly in major urban areas which may in turn lead to a decline in other sectors of commercial real estate such as multifamily and retail 

in 2020 we transitioned a significant subset of our employee population to remote work environments to help mitigate the public health risk and comply with government directives most of whom continue to work remotely these arrangements increase our reliance on technology and may exacerbate certain risks to our business including those relating to the security and effectiveness of our information and technology networks while we have undertaken measures that we believe to be best practices to safeguard cbre operations and business continuity there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in every instance in addition certain of our employees and independent contractors in particular in our global workplace solutions segment have been deemed to be “essential workers” and are unable to work remotely as a result they may be exposed to covid19 in their workplaces if one of more of our employees independent contractors clients or others at our worksites becomes ill from covid19 and attributes their exposure to such illness to us or one of our worksites we could be subject to allegations of failure to adequately mitigate the risk of such exposure such allegations could harm our reputation and expose us to the risks of litigation and liability 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic governmental business and other actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response the effect on our clients and client demand for our services the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs particularly if members of our workforce are quarantined as a result of exposure the ability of our clients to pay for our services the acceleration of secular changes in the use of certain commercial real estate and any closures of our or our clients’ offices and 

table of contents 

facilities in addition if the pandemic continues to create disruptions in the credit or financial markets or impacts our credit ratings it could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted this situation continues to change rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently to the extent the covid19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described elsewhere in this annual report 

a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business depends upon our relationships with us government sponsored enterprises as an approved sellerservicer for the government sponsored enterprises we are required to originate and service loans in accordance with their individual program requirements including participation in loss sharing and repurchase arrangements our obligations under these programs may materially and adversely impact our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business which we conduct through certain of our whollyowned subsidiaries depends upon our relationship with the federal national mortgage association fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac collectively the government sponsored enterprises gses numerous pieces of legislation seeking various types of changes designed to reform the gses and the us housing finance system have been introduced in congress including among other things changes to the role the gses play in the us housing finance system and the winding down or conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac over a period of years legislation that curtails the gses’ activities andor alters the structure or existence of the gses if enacted may result in a significant decrease in our loan origination and servicing revenue and could have a material impact on our loan origination and servicing business 

as an approved sellerservicer for the gses we are required to comply with various eligibility criteria and are required to originate and service loans in accordance with their individual program requirements failure to comply with these requirements may result in termination or withdrawal of our approval to sell and service the gse loans on march 27 2020 the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was enacted in the us in response to the covid19 pandemic the cares act among other things permits borrowers with governmentbacked mortgages from gses who are experiencing a financial hardship to obtain forbearance of their loans which may materially increase our exposure under such programs for fannie mae loans that we service we are obligated to advance scheduled principal and interest payments to fannie mae regardless of whether the borrowers actually make the payments these advances are reimbursable by fannie mae after 120 days but require an immediate capital outlay further with respect to fannie mae loans if the loan goes into foreclosure or is restructured we have an obligation to share in up to onethird of any losses for the freddie mac small balance lending sbl program we could potentially be obligated to repurchase any loan that remains in default for 120 days following the forbearance period if the default occurred during the first 12 months after origination and such loan had not been earlier securitized in addition we may be responsible for a loss not to exceed 10 of the original principal amount of any sbl loan that is not securitized and goes into default after the 12month repurchase period we may need to secure additional sources of financing in order to satisfy our forbearance and loss sharingrepurchase obligations under these programs we cannot make any assurances that such financing would be available on attractive terms if at all our forbearance and loss sharingrepurchase obligations under these programs may materially adversely impact our results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

we have numerous local regional and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future competition 

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including property management facilities management project and transaction management tenant and landlord leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and structured finance flexible space solutions real estate investment management valuation loan servicing development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2020 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines 

table of contents 

depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate services providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments developers flexible space providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions 

although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve in addition disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively furthermore we are substantially dependent on longterm client relationships and on revenue received for services under various service agreements many of these agreements may be canceled by the client for any reason with as little as 30 to 60 days’ notice as is typical in the industry 

in this competitive market if we are unable to maintain longterm client relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients our business results of operations andor financial condition may be materially adversely affected there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

our growth and financial performance have benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future 

acquisitions have accounted for a significant component of our growth over time any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices terms and conditions as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions which could increase the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt acquisitions involve risks that business judgments made concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove to be incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which could include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be costly and may adversely impact our business and the acquired company’s business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of accounting and information technology systems 

we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits but the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions are subject to a number of uncertainties including the ability to timely realize accretive benefits the level of attrition from professionals licensed or associated with the acquired companies and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business financial condition and operating results

the protection of our brand including related trademarks may require the expenditure of significant financial and operational resources moreover the steps we take to protect our brand may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks even when we detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks any unauthorized use by third parties of our brand may adversely affect our brand furthermore as we continue to expand our business especially internationally there is a risk we may face claims of infringement or other alleged violations of thirdparty intellectual property rights which may restrict us from leveraging our brand in a manner consistent with our business goals 

our real estate investments businesses including our real estate investment programs and coinvestment activities subject us to performance and real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flow and impact our ability to raise capital for future investments 

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our investment management business line within our real estate investments segment can be volatile primarily because the management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements in the event that any of the investment programs that our investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2020 we had committed 765 million to fund future coinvestments in our real estate investments segment approximately 301 million of which is expected to be funded during 2021 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our investment management line of business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments

selective investment in real estate projects is critical to our development services business strategy within our real estate investments segment and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2020 we had 21 real estate projects consolidated in our financial statements in addition as of december 31 2020 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 80 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 2020 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 348 million as of december 31 2020 we also had letters of credit of 150 million in our uk development business which relate to our share of certain cost overrun of unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries in our us development business with outstanding balances of 75 million 

during the ordinary course of business within our development services business line we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

the success of our global workplace solutions segment depends on our ability to enter into mutually beneficial contracts deliver high quality levels of service and accurately assess working capital requirements 

contracts for our global workplace solutions clients often include complex terms regarding payment of fees risk transfer liability limitations termination due diligence and transition timeframes further the facilities management and project management businesses within our global workplace solutions segment are often impacted by transition activities in the first year of a contract as well as the timing of starting operations on these large client contracts if we are unable to negotiate contracts with our clients in a timely manner and on mutually beneficial terms or there is a delay in becoming fully operational our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted further if we fail to deliver the highquality levels of service expected by our clients it may result in reputational and financial damage and could impact our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients 

our global workplace solutions segment also requires us to accurately model the working capital needs of this business should we fail to accurately assess working capital requirements the cash flow generated by this business may be adversely impacted in addition if we do not accurately assess the creditworthiness of a client or if a client’s creditworthiness changes during the term of the contract we could potentially be unable to collect on any outstanding payments 

a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements could result in economic and reputational harm to us 

we rely on third parties and in some cases subcontractors to perform activities on behalf of our organization to improve quality increase efficiencies cut costs and lower operational risks across our business and support functions we have instituted a supplier code of conduct which is intended to communicate to our vendors the standards of conduct we expect them to uphold our contracts with vendors typically impose a contractual obligation to comply with our supplier code of conduct in addition we leverage technology to help us better screen vendors with the aim of gaining a deeper understanding of the compliance data privacy health and safety environmental sustainability and other risks posed to our business by potential and existing vendors if our third parties do not have the proper safeguards and controls in place or appropriate oversight cannot be provided we could be exposed to increased operational regulatory financial or reputational risks a failure by third parties to comply with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements in a high quality and timely manner could result in economic and reputational harm to us in addition these third parties face their own technology operating business and economic risks and any significant failures by them including the improper use or disclosure of our confidential client employee or company information could cause damage to our reputation and harm to our business

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees while certain of our executive officers and key employees are subject to longterm compensatory arrangements there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all key members of our senior management we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to materially suffer competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business we and our competitors use equity incentives and signon and retention bonuses to help attract retain and incentivize key personnel as competition is significant for the services of such personnel the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase which could negatively impact our profitability or result in our inability to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could materially suffer 

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our global operations we might be unable to achieve our business objectives  

our global operations present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals the size of our employee base increases the possibility that we will have individuals who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to business and reputational risks if we are not successful in continuing to develop and implement the processes and tools designed to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our reputation and ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change if we do not successfully implement any such changes our business and results of operation may be negatively and materially impacted 

our policies procedures and programs to safeguard the health safety and security of our employees and others may not be adequate 

we have more than 100000 employees as well as independent contractors working in over 100 countries we have undertaken to implement what we believe to be best practices to safeguard the health safety and security of our employees independent contractors clients and others at our worksites however if these policies procedures and programs are not adequate or employees do not receive related adequate training or follow them for any reason the consequences may be severe to us including serious injury or loss of life which could impair our operations and cause us to incur significant legal liability or fines as well as reputational damage our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover any legal liability or fines that we incur for health safety or security incidents 

table of contents 

we may be subject to actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

similar to other global services companies with different business lines and a broad client base we may be subject to potential conflicts of interests in the provision of our services for example conflicts may arise from our role in advising or representing both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions in certain cases we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our clients in such situations our policies are designed to give full disclosure and transparency to all parties as well as implement appropriate barriers on informationsharing and other activities to ensure each party’s interests are protected however there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in every case if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations there could be an adverse effect on our business or reputation regardless of whether any such claims have merit in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that potential conflicts of interest will not materially adversely affect us 

infrastructure disruptions may disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients 

our ability to conduct a global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located this may include disruptions as a result of political instability public health crises attacks on our information technology systems terrorist attacks interruptions or delays in services from thirdparty data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers employee errors or malfeasance building defects utility outages and natural disasters such as fires earthquakes floods and hurricanes the infrastructure disruptions we may experience as a result of such disasters could also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of our real estate investments in our investment management and development services businesses 

the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by people daily we also manage the critical facilities including data centers that our clients rely on to serve the public and their customers where unplanned downtime could potentially disrupt other parts of their businesses or society as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters building defects terrorist attacks mass shootings or infrastructure disruptions can result in significant loss of life or injury and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm 

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could materially harm our business 

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the us and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents 

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly 

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business political economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter particularly those that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a proportionally larger effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

risks related to our indebtedness 

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

as of december 31 2020 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 our interest expense was 829 million 

our debt instruments impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

◦ plan for or react to market conditions 

◦ meet capital needs or otherwise restrict our activities or business plans and 

◦ finance ongoing operations strategic acquisitions investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest including 

◦ incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness 

◦ entering into mergers and consolidations 

◦ creating liens and 

◦ entering into saleleaseback transactions 

our credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt as defined in the credit agreement less available cash as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated ebitda as of the end of each fiscal quarter our ability to meet these financial ratios may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments 

table of contents 

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness in addition in the event of a creditratings downgrade our ability to borrow and the costs of such borrowings could be adversely affected 

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments in addition moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades of them may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings 

risks related to our information technology cybersecurity and data protection 

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes we may incur material financial penalties

risks related to our internal controls and accounting policies 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our results of operations and stock price could be materially adversely affected 

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls as disclosed in part ii item 9a during the fourth quarter of 2019 management identified several material weaknesses in internal control related to our global workplace solutions segment in the europe middle east  africa region or gws emea remediation of these material weaknesses is ongoing as a result even though a material misstatement was not identified in the gws emea financial statements it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the gws emea financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis and therefore management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2020 internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner or are otherwise unable to maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our stock price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected 

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired which may require us to take material noncash charges against earnings 

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations

 item 2 properties 

as of december 31 2020 we occupied offices excluding affiliates in the following geographical regions 



some of our offices house employees from more than one of our business segments ie an office might house employees from all three of our business segments as such we have provided the above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting or triple counting our offices 

we lease all of our office space and believe it is adequate for our current needs the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic areas our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business we believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefore as liabilities on our consolidated financial statements are unlikely to be significant but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december 31 2018 and comparisons between the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 is included in part ii item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in the company’s annual report filed with the sec on march 2 2020 

overview 

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm based on 2020 revenue with leading global market positions in our leasing property sales occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses as of december 31 2020 the company has more than 100000 employees excluding affiliates serving clients in more than 100 countries 

our business is focused on providing services to real estate investors and occupiers for investors we provide capital markets property sales mortgage origination sales and servicing property leasing investment management property management valuation and development services among others for occupiers we provide facilities management project management transaction both property sales and leasing and consulting services among others we provide services under the following brand names “cbre” real estate advisory and outsourcing services “cbre global investors” investment management “trammell crow company” us development “telford homes” uk development and “hana” flexiblespace solutions in 2020 cbre sponsored a spac cbre acquisition holdings which has the sole purpose of acquiring a privately held company with significant growth potential and to create value by supporting the company in the public markets the company that it acquires is expected to operate in an industry that will benefit from the experience expertise and operating skills of cbre cbre acquisition holdings trades on the nyse under the symbols “cbah” “cbahu” and “cbahw” 

our revenue mix has shifted toward more stable revenue sources particularly occupier outsourcing and our dependence on highly cyclical property sales and lease transaction revenue has declined markedly over the past decade we believe we are wellpositioned to capture a substantial and growing share of market opportunities at a time when investors and occupiers increasingly prefer to purchase integrated accountbased services on a national and global basis we generate revenue from both management fees large multiyear portfolio and perproject contracts and commissions on transactions 

in 2020 we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients including more than 90 of the fortune 100 companies we have been an sp 500 company since 2006 and in 2020 we were ranked 128 on the fortune 500 we have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the lipsey company survey for 20 years in a row including 2021 we have also been rated a world’s most ethical company by the ethisphere institute for eight consecutive years including 2021 and are included in both the dow jones world sustainability index and the bloomberg genderequality index for two years in a row 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

revenue recognition 

to recognize revenue in a transaction with a customer we evaluate the five steps of the accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue recognition framework 1 identify the contract 2 identify the performance obligationss in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and 5 recognize revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied 

table of contents 

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five step framework understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time amount and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires significant judgement these significant judgements include i determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer ii applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time iii estimating how and when contingencies or other forms of variable consideration will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue and iv determining whether we control third party services before they are transferred to the customer in order to appropriately recognize the associated fees on either a gross or net basis the timing and amount of revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue incentivebased management fees development fees and third party fees associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management services for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews 

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb asc topic 350 “ intangibles – goodwill and other ” topic 350 we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of our reporting units to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is needed we are permitted to assess based on qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test if not we do not need to apply the quantitative test the qualitative test is elective and we can go directly to the quantitative test rather than making a morelikelythannot assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors when performing a quantitative test we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2020 and 2019 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code including a decrease to the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and a onetime transition tax ie toll charge or the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 we are paying the federal tax liability for the transition tax in annual interestfree installments over a period of eight years through 2025 as allowed by the tax act 

on march 18 2020 the families first coronavirus response act ffcr act and on march 27 2020 the cares act were each enacted in response to the covid19 pandemic the ffcr act and the cares act contain numerous tax provisions such as net operating loss carryback periods alternative minimum tax credit refunds deferral of employer payroll taxes deferring payroll tax payments establishing a credit for the retention of certain employees relaxing limitations on the deductibility of interest and updating the definition of qualified improvement property this legislation currently has no material impact to income tax expense on the company’s financial statements 

our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items 

see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes

seasonality 

in a typical year a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities have tended to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend the severe and ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic may cause seasonality to deviate from historical patterns 

table of contents 

inflation 

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by inflation however to date we believe that general inflation has not had a material impact upon our operations 

items affecting comparability 

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties particularly those caused or exacerbated by covid19 that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

macroeconomic conditions 

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth with specific sensitivity to growth in officebased employment interest rate levels and changes in interest rates the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business 

compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effects on our operating margins of difficult market conditions such as we are currently experiencing with the covid19 pandemic is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe like during the current covid19 pandemic we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved additionally our contractual revenue has increased primarily as a result of growth in our outsourcing business and we believe this contractual revenue should help offset the negative impacts that macroeconomic deterioration could have on other parts of our business nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our consolidated operations and financial condition 

from 2010 to early 2020 commercial real estate markets had generally been characterized by increased demand for space falling vacancies higher rents and strong capital flows leading to solid property sales and leasing activity this healthy backdrop changed abruptly in the first quarter of 2020 with the emergence of the covid19 pandemic and resultant sharp contraction of economic activity across much of the world since then there has been a severe impact on commercial real estate markets as many property owners and occupiers have put transactions on hold and withdrawn existing mandates sharply reducing sales and leasing volumes we expect to see the highly challenging operating environment continue as covid19 caseloads remain elevated across our major markets business travel and facetoface business dealings are limited and the overwhelming majority of workers remain out of their offices the recovery of real estate markets around the world remain uncertain as of the date of this report 

covid19 is putting downward pressure on parts of our business and creating larger opportunities in other parts the severe economic effects of the pandemic continued to weigh most heavily on highermargin property lease and sales revenue in the advisory services segment however global industrial leasing revenue fueled by ecommerce grew strongly during the fourth quarter reflecting the resiliency of this asset type also during the fourth quarter we saw improvement in sales activity in the us and certain north asia markets but transaction volumes there and elsewhere in the world remain well below prepandemic levels 

table of contents 

the future performance of our global real estate services and investment businesses depends on a recovery of global market conditions including restored business and consumer confidence sustained economic growth solid and consistent job creation stable functioning global credit markets and a receding of the covid19 pandemic 

effects of acquisitions 

we have historically made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service capabilities around the world most recently we acquired telford homes plc telford a leading developer of multifamily residential properties in the london area in october 2019 telford which is reported in our real estate investments segment expanded our real estate development business outside the us for the first time 

in june 2018 we acquired facilitysource holdings llc facilitysource to help us build a techenabled supply chain capability for the occupier outsourcing industry which would drive meaningfully differentiated outcomes for leading occupiers of real estate facilitysource results are reflected in our global workplace solutions segment 

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform or independent affiliates which in some cases we held a small equity interest in early 2021 we acquired a construction and project management firm based in southern california 

during 2020 we completed six infill acquisitions leading local facilities management firms in spain and italy a us firm that helps companies reduce telecommunications costs a technologyfocused project management firm based in florida a firm specializing in performing real estate valuations in south korea and a facilities management and technical maintenance firm in australia during 2019 in addition to the telford strategic acquisition we completed eight infill acquisitions a leading advanced analytics software company based in the uk a commercial and residential real estate appraisal firm in florida our former affiliate in omaha a project management firm in australia a valuation and consulting business in switzerland a leading project management firm in israel a fullservice real estate firm in san antonio with a focus on retail office medical office and land and a debtfocused real estate investment management business in the uk 

we believe strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position – or expand our capabilities – within targeted markets or business lines in general however most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating income and net income as a result of transactionrelated expenditures including severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs as well as costs and charges associated with integrating the acquired business and integrating its financial and accounting systems into our own 

our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase consideration in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2020 we have accrued deferred purchase consideration totaling 825 million which is included in “accounts payable and accrued expenses” and in “other longterm liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

international operations 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the us and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally our real estate investments business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe in addition our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies such as the euro and british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

table of contents 

we are closely monitoring the impact of the covid19 pandemic on business conditions across all regions worldwide covid19 has significantly impacted our operations and has the potential to further constrain our business activity see “the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition” in part i item 1a “risk factors” for additional risks related to the covid19 pandemic 

our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions or the perception that such disruptions may occur that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty for example we are continuing to monitor the trade and economic effects of the uk’s withdrawal from the european union brexit particularly its impact on sales and office and retail leasing activity in the uk any currency volatility associated with the covid19 pandemic brexit or other economic dislocations could impact our results of operations 

during the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 44 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies us dollars in thousands 



 

1 approximately 40 currencies comprise 69 of our revenue for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results for example we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2020 the net impact would have been a decrease in pretax income of 31 million had the eurotous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2020 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 93 million these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into us dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations 

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 dollars in thousands 



fee revenue and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use these measures in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we generally use these nongaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of fee revenue and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

table of contents 

fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients we believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company’s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business 

ebitda represents earnings before depreciation and amortization asset impairments interest expense net of interest income writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt and provision for income taxes amounts shown for adjusted ebitda further remove from ebitda the impact of costs associated with transformation initiatives costs associated with workforce optimization efforts fair value adjustments to real estate assets acquired in the telford acquisition purchase accounting that were sold in the period costs incurred related to legal entity restructuring integration and other costs related to acquisitions carried interest incentive compensation expense reversal to align with the timing of associated revenue and costs associated with our reorganization including costsavings initiatives we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending 

adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments this measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our credit facilities and debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt we also use adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs 

adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows dollars in thousands 



 

1 during 2020 management began the implementation of certain transformation initiatives to enable the company to reduce costs streamline operations and support future growth the majority of expenses incurred were cash in nature and primarily related to employee separation benefits lease termination costs and professional fees see note 21 of our notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

table of contents 

2 primarily represents costs incurred related to workforce optimization initiated and executed in the second quarter of 2020 as part of management’s cost containment efforts in response to the covid19 pandemic the charges are cash expenditures primarily for severance costs incurred related to this effort of the total costs 74 million was included within the “cost of revenue” line item and 302 million was included in the “operating administrative and other” line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 

3 primarily represents severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with our reorganization announced in the third quarter of 2018 that became effective january 1 2019 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

we reported consolidated net income of 7520 million for the year december 31 2020 on revenue of 238 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 13 billion on revenue of 239 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2020 decreased by 679 million or 03 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the revenue decrease reflects decreases in our advisory services segment due to the impact of covid19 including lower sales down 222 as compared to the same period in 2019 and leasing revenue down 265 as compared to the same period in 2019 these decreases were partially offset by increases in revenue in our global workplace solutions segment up 80 as compared to the same period in 2019 led by growth in our facilities management line of business driven by its contractual nature and improved revenue in our real estate investments segment up 259 as compared to the same period in 2019 largely due to the telford acquisition and an increase in investment management fees foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2020 

our cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 3586 million or 19 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global workplace solutions segment due to growth in our facilities management business and higher costs in our real estate investments segment due to the telford acquisition we also incurred 421 million of costs primarily employee separation benefits related to the company’s transformation initiatives during 2020 to enable the company to reduce costs streamline operations and support future growth these items were partially offset by lower commission expense incurred during the year ended december 31 2020 our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our sales and lease revenue performance accordingly the decrease in advisory sales and leasing revenue led to a corresponding decrease in commission expense these items were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation which had a 012 positive impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31 2020 cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased from 782 for the year ended december 31 2019 to 799 for the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by our mix of revenue with revenue from our global workplace solutions segment which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior period 

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by 1298 million or 38 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 the negative impact of covid19 on our operating results led to a corresponding reduction in certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment marketing and employee events to manage financial performance as well as reduced stock compensation expense these items were partially offset by 1130 million of costs primarily related to employee separation benefits lease termination costs and professional fees related to the company’s transformation initiatives mentioned above as well as 302 million of costs related to workforce optimization efforts executed primarily in the second quarter of 2020 we also incurred higher incremental costs associated with telford which we acquired on october 1 2019 rent expense for our new flexible space offering higher bad debt expense as a result of covid19 and higher charitable contributions due to donations to our covid19 relief fund foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total operating administrative and other expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 144 for the year ended december 31 2019 to 139 for the year ended december 31 2020 reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business and reduced discretionary spending 

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 625 million or 142 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 this increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of 605 million during the year ended december 31 2020 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures and accelerated depreciation related to lease terminations included in our transformation initiatives 

table of contents 

our asset impairments on a consolidated basis totaled 887 million and 898 million during the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively for the year ended december 31 2020 asset impairments comprised the following 502 million of noncash asset impairment charges in our global workplace solutions segment a noncash goodwill impairment charge of 250 million and noncash asset impairment charges of 135 million in our real estate investments segment primarily as a result of the recent global economic disruption and uncertainty due to covid19 we deemed there to be triggering events during 2020 that required testing of goodwill and certain assets for impairment based on these events we recorded the aforementioned noncash impairment charges which were primarily driven by lower anticipated cash flows in certain businesses directly resulting from a downturn in forecasts as well as increased forecast risk due to covid19 and changes in our business going forward during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded a noncash intangible asset impairment charge of 898 million in our real estate investments segment this noncash writeoff resulted from a review of the anticipated cash flows and the decrease in assets under management in our public securities business driven in part by a continued industrywide shift in investor preference for passive investment programs 

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis increased by 680 million or 3430 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 these gains resulted from property sales within our real estate investments segment 

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by 348 million or 216 during the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 primarily driven by lower equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our real estate investments segment 

our other income on a consolidated basis was 174 million for the year ended december 31 2020 versus 289 million for the same period in the prior year the decrease was primarily due to higher net unrealized gains in the prior year compared to the current year on certain of our coinvestments 

our consolidated interest expense net of interest income decreased by 180 million or 210 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 this decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense on borrowings associated with our credit agreement driven by lower interest rates as well as reduced net interest expense overseas associated with cash pooling arrangements 

our writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was 756 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 26 million for the year ended december 31 2019 the costs for the year ended december 31 2020 included a 736 million premium paid and the writeoff of 20 million of unamortized premium and debt issuance costs in connection with the redemption in full of the 4250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 525 senior notes the costs for the year ended december 31 2019 were incurred in connection with the refinancing of our credit agreement 

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 2141 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to 699 million for the same period in 2019 our effective tax rate increased from 51 for the year ended december 31 2019 to 221 for the year ended december 31 2020 the lower tax rate for year ended december 31 2019 was primarily driven by a 2772 million net tax benefit recorded in 2019 attributable to outside basis differences recognized as a result of a legal entity restructuring

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

revenue increased by 1709 million or 259 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by the telford acquisition in our development services line of business and an increase in investment management fees primarily related to growth in aum foreign currency translation had a 07 positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2020 primarily driven by strength in the british pound sterling and euro 

cost of revenue increased by 885 million or 1042 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 driven by the telford acquisition which we acquired on october 1 2019 

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 34 million or 05 for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the same period in 2019 primarily driven by incremental costs associated with telford which we acquired on october 1 2019 increased results driven bonus expense in our development services line of business driven by higher property sales in 2020 rent expense for our new flexible space offering workforce optimization costs and transformation initiative costs these increases are partially offset by decreases in certain operating expenses such as travel and entertainment costs as a result of covid19 a reduction in integration and transaction costs for telford and a reduction in carried interest expense foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2020 

a roll forward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31 2020 is as follows dollars in billions 



aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide or participate in oversight investment management services and other advice and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market not the basis for determining our management fees our assets under management consist of 

• the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either whollyowned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have invested or to which they have provided financing committed but unfunded capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our aum the value of development properties is included at estimated completion cost in the case of real estate operating companies the total value of real properties controlled by the companies generally through joint ventures is included in aum and 

table of contents 

• the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios including investments which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital in private real estate funds under our fund of funds investments 

our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers 

liquidity and capital resources 

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2021 include up to approximately 235 million of anticipated capital expenditures net of tenant concessions as of december 31 2020 we had aggregate commitments of 765 million to fund future coinvestments in our real estate investments business 301 million of which is expected to be funded in 2021 additionally as of december 31 2020 we are committed to fund 348 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our real estate investments business which we may be required to fund at any time as of december 31 2020 we had 28 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility and 18 billion of cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate use 

we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and general investment requirements including strategic infill acquisitions and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future and at a minimum for the next 12 months given compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals are generally paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production the negative effect of difficult market conditions is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments as we have done in the past with new debt instruments at interest rates maturities and terms we deem attractive we may also from time to time in our sole discretion purchase redeem or retire our existing senior notes through tender offers in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise on december 28 2020 we redeemed the 4250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 525 senior notes due 2025 in full we funded this redemption using cash on hand 

as noted above we believe that any future significant acquisitions we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions 

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are generally comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness if our cash flow is insufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

the second longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase consideration in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had accrued deferred purchase consideration totaling 825 million 143 million of which was a current liability and 1117 million 416 million of which was a current liability respectively which was included in “accounts payable and accrued expenses” and in “other liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

table of contents 

lastly as described in note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report our board of directors authorized a program for the repurchase of up to 5000 million of our class a common stock over three years during the year ended december 31 2020 we spent 500 million to repurchase 1050084 shares of our class a common stock at an average price of 4762 per share using cash on hand our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future repurchases with existing cash we may utilize our stock repurchase program to continue offsetting the impact of our stockbased compensation program and on a more opportunistic basis if we believe our stock presents a compelling investment compared to other discretionary uses the timing of any future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions and other factors as of december 31 2020 we had 3500 million of capacity remaining under our repurchase program 

historical cash flows 

year ended december 31 2020 compared to year ended december 31 2019 

operating activities 

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 an increase of 6074 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the company experienced an overall increase in net working capital of approximately 11 billion partially offset by lower net income of 5356 million as compared to the same period in the previous year the positive impact from net working capital was largely attributable to a decrease in accounts receivable due to a heightened focus on cash collections across our businesses and lower net income tax payments due to the refunds received in the current year related to the prior year tax restructuring partially offset by a net decrease to accounts payable and accrued expenses as well as compensation payable and accrued bonus 

investing activities 

net cash used in investing activities totaled 3416 million for the year ended december 31 2020 a decrease of 3794 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 this decrease was largely driven by a decrease of 269 million in capital expenditures during 2020 and lower amounts paid for acquisitions compared to 2019 which was driven primarily by the telford acquisition 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 6253 million for the year ended december 31 2020 an increase of 3533 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2019 this increase was primarily due to the impact of the full redemption of the 4250 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 525 senior notes including a premium of 736 million and due to 448 million in lower net contributions received from noncontrolling interests during the year ended december 31 2020 this was partially offset by the impact of repayment of debt assumed in the telford acquisition of 1107 million during 2019 in addition we used 951 million less for repurchase of common stock during the year ended december 31 2020

indebtedness

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply fasb asc topic 815 “ derivatives and hedging ” when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

exchange rates 

our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional reporting currency which is the us dollar see the discussion of international operations which is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “international operations” and is incorporated by reference herein 

interest rates 

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt historically we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2020 we do not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements 

the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 7722 million at december 31 2020 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair value of our 4875 senior notes was 7025 million at december 31 2020 

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2020 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 75 million on pretax income and a decrease of 75 million in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2020

 item 9a controls and procedures 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f of the exchange act the company’s management with participation of the ceo and cfo under the oversight of our board of directors evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 using the framework in internal control  integrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on that evaluation management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2020 due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 

1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 

2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 

3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 due to the fact that material weaknesses existed in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as further described below a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 

our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has expressed an adverse report on the operating effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting kpmg llp’s report is included herein on page 57  

material weaknesses identified relating to global workplace solutions segment – europe middle east  africa region gws emea 

based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 due to the fact that material weaknesses existed in gws emea 

as of december 31 2019 we determined that the severity of control failures isolated to gws emea led management to conclude that the following material weaknesses existed in the internal control environment in gws emea 

• gws emea did not have sufficient resources in the local gws emea territories with the appropriate reporting lines roles and responsibilities authority training and skill sets to design and operate financial activities including controls in an appropriate and timely manner 

• gws emea did not effectively assess and address the risks posed by changes in the business and the related effect on the gws emea system of internal controls in relation to this specific to the rollout of gws emea’s primary financial system gws emea did not effectively operate general information technology controls related to financial data migrations user access system changes and financial data processing because of the deficiencies in general information technology controls the business process controls automated and manual that are dependent on this system were also deemed ineffective because they could have been adversely impacted 

• gws emea did not design or execute control activities that sufficiently mitigated the financial reporting risks related to gws emea 

• gws emea did not have an effective information and communication process to identify capture and process relevant information necessary for financial accounting and reporting 

• the company did not monitor the presentation and effectiveness of components of internal control through evaluation and remediation in an appropriate manner within gws emea and gws emea was not sufficiently integrated with the corporate oversight function 

consequently there were control failures for gws emea in the areas of revenue and receivables balance sheet account reconciliations journal entries and general information technology controls during 2020 even though a material misstatement was not identified in the gws emea financial statements it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the gws emea financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis 

the company’s plan to remediate the material weaknesses 

the company with the oversight from the audit committee of the board of directors is committed to remediating the gws emea material weaknesses in a timely manner we are executing remediation plans intended to address the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting we are engaged in various stages of remedial actions to address the material weaknesses described above we are using both internal and external resources to assist in the following actions 

• performing a comprehensive review of the gws emea’s finance and accounting operating model to establish and implement a target operating model under the recently developed finance innovation office under the chief financial officer which will assess people and headcount reporting lines roles and responsibilities training technology and tools 

• assessing key processes at material gws emea locations to ensure that the processes procedures and controls are adequately designed are clearly documented standardized and appropriately communicated to enhance control ownership throughout the gws emea organization 

• reviewing the gws emea finance and accounting organization to ensure gws emea compliance and information technology resources are under the cbre global sox and financial reporting systems governance programs led by the chief accounting officer and that control preparers and reviewers align to an appropriate organizational structure to sustain the remedial actions including those related to business process and general information technology controls 

• evaluating and designing controls to address the completeness and accuracy of data used to support key estimations accounting transactions and disclosures primarily associated with spreadsheets and other key reports 

• enhancing gws emea’s risk assessment and monitoring procedures by implementing new training activities hiring additional capable resources and enhancing our risk and fraud risk assessment processes to ensure appropriate resources and controls are in place to mitigate risks as commensurate with the global risk assessment and that gws emea’s process is fully incorporated into the corporate oversight function 

management has taken the following remediation actions related to the gws emea material weaknesses during 2020 

• we performed a comprehensive review of the gws emea finance and accounting organization and implemented a new operating model to establish accountability reporting lines and roles and responsibilities 

• we began hiring staff responsible for internal control over financial reporting in alignment with the new operating model 

• we began implementing an ongoing training program addressing internal control over financial reporting including educating control owners concerning the requirements of each control 

• we are designing risk assessment procedures aligned with the global framework and corporate oversight to ensure internal control over financial reporting risks are evaluated in a timely and consistent manner 

• we developed documentation for underlying business processes and information technology general controls to promote control ownership and consistent operation of controls 

• we are designing standardized controls and procedures over completeness and accuracy of data used in performing controls including information technology and financial reporting controls 

our remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses are ongoing the material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls have been fully designed documented implemented and operate for a sufficient period of time for management to conclude through testing that these controls are operating effectively while we intend to complete the remediation of the material weaknesses in 2021 given the inherent complexities and limitations caused by the ongoing covid19 pandemic there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully complete the remediation within the contemplated timeline 

disclosure controls and procedures 

our chief executive officer and chief financial officer “certifying officers” have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the exchange act as of december 31 2020 our certifying officers concluded that as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as described above our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2020 

rule 13a15 of the securities and exchange act of 1934 as amended requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same this evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects the evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our sec reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the sec’s rules and forms any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of 

achieving the desired control objectives our chief executive officer and chief financial officer supervise and participate in this evaluation and they are assisted by members of our disclosure committee our disclosure committee consists of our general counsel our senior vice president corporate finance our chief administrative officer our chief communication officer our senior vice president risk and assurance our senior officers of significant business lines and other select employees 

in light of the material weaknesses described above management performed additional analysis and other procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap accordingly management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k fairly present in all material respects our financial position results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented in accordance with gaap 

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting our remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses are ongoing

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are some of them are larger on a regional or localmarket basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as jones lang lasalle incorporated or jll cushman  wakefield colliers international group inc savills plc and newmark group inc marketsegment specialists such as eastdil secured marcus  millichap inc and walker  dunlop and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business such as iss and sodexo in addition in recent years providers of flexible officespace solutions such as wework iwgregusspaces industrious and knotel have offered services directly to occupiers providing competition particularly for smaller space requirements these providers also compete directly with our flexiblespace solutions subsidiary cbre hana llc which launched in 2019

seasonality

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that later become material may also adversely affect our business

risks related to our business environment

our performance is significantly related to general economic political and regulatory conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity constraints significant public health events such as pandemics fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal or political uncertainty market volatility declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we operate which can result in a decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities 

 

our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions or the perception that such disruptions may occur that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty for example in 2019 continued uncertainty throughout the year about the date and the terms on which the united kingdom w ould leave the european union led to lower lease and sales volumes following the united kingdom’s exit from the european union on january 31 2020 ongoing uncertainty over the country’s longterm economic and trade relationship with the european union may continue to cause market volatility and currency fluctuations and adversely impact business and consumer confidence or the economy in general which may adversely affect business in the united kingdom and other european businesses these uncertainties and any perception of weakness in the british economy could not only impact the performance of commercial real estate assets located in the united kingdom but access to funds from investors located in the united kingdom 

adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty or significant public health events such as pandemics could also lead to a decline in leasing volume property sales prices funds invested in commercial real estate assets or planned development activity which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees we earn during 2019 our asia pacific business experienced declines in leasing activity amid rising geopolitical and trade uncertainty and slowing regional economies furthermore in december 2019 a strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china resulting in decreased economic activity in china and concerns about a potential pandemic which would adversely affect the broader global economy at this point the extent to which this coronavirus may impact the global economy and our results is uncertain but pandemics or other significant public health events or the perception that such events may occur could have a material adverse effect on our business

we also make coinvestments alongside our investor clients in our development and investment management businesses during an economic downturn capital for our investment activities could be constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or sale prices we achieve may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the volume of loans our capital markets business originates andor services fees within our property management business are generally based on a percentage of rent collections making them sensitive to macroeconomic conditions that negatively impact rent collections and the performance of the properties we manage

economic political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global landscape make it difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future as a result any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on thencurrent conditions and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition

our investment management development services and capital markets including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as financial liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate markets

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to obtain credit on favorable terms there may be fewer property leasing disposition and acquisition transactions in addition under such conditions our investment management and development services businesses may be unable to attract capital or achieve returns sufficient to earn incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a prolonged decline in the value of investments made

 

our operations are subject to social political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility 

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2019 approximately 42 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan czech koruna danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee israeli shekel japanese yen korean won mexican peso new zealand dollar polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in revenue and earnings as well as the assets under management for our investment management business over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results

in addition we are exposed to international economic trends foreign governmental policy actions and the following factors that may adversely affect the performance of our business





















we maintain anticorruption and antimoneylaundering compliance programs throughout the company as well as programs designed to enable us to comply with any potential government economic sanctions embargoes or other importexport controls however coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business

 

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have established operations and seek to grow our presence in many emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there 

risks related to our operations

we have numerous local regional and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future competition

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including property management facilities management project and transaction management tenant and landlord leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and structured finance flexible space solutions real estate investment management valuation loan servicing development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2019 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines

depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate services providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments developers flexible space providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions

although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve in addition disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively furthermore we are substantially dependent on longterm client relationships and on revenue received for services under various service agreements many of these agreements may be canceled by the client for any reason with as little as 30 to 60 days’ notice as is typical in the industry 

in this competitive market if we are unable to maintain longterm client relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients our business results of operations andor financial condition may be materially adversely affected there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

our growth and financial performance have benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future

acquisitions have accounted for a significant component of our growth over time any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive prices terms and conditions as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the 

 

documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase acquisitions involve risks that business judgments made concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove to be incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which could include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may adversely impact our business and the acquired company’s business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology and accounting and management services

we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits including enhanced or more stable revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities cost synergies tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted net income per share achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated whether we will experience greaterthanexpected attrition from professionals licensed or associated with the acquired companies and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business financial condition and operating results

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer while certain of our executive officers and key employees are subject to longterm compensatory arrangements which often include retention incentives and various restrictive covenants there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all key members of our senior management we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business we and our competitors use equity incentives and signon and retention bonuses to help attract retain and incentivize key personnel as competition is significant for the services of such personnel the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase which could negatively impact our profitability or result in our inability to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives  

our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to business and reputational risks if we are not successful in continuing to develop and implement the processes and tools designed to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our reputation and ability 

 

to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change  if we do not successfully implement any such changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted 

our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace

our brand and reputation are key assets and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices management workplace culture financial condition our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including handling of complaints regulatory compliance such as compliance with government sanctions the foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa the uk bribery act and other antibribery antimoney laundering and corruption laws the use and protection of client and other sensitive information and from actions taken by regulators or others in response to such conduct furthermore as a company with headquarters and operations located in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand abroad although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity would materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by the actions of third parties that are outside of our control including vendors and joint venture partners

the protection of our brand including related trademarks may require the expenditure of significant financial and operational resources moreover the steps we take to protect our brand may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks even when we detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks any unauthorized use by third parties of our brand may adversely affect our brand furthermore as we continue to expand our business especially internationally there is a risk we may face claims of infringement or other alleged violations of thirdparty intellectual property rights which may restrict us from leveraging our brand in a manner consistent with our business goals

our real estate investments businesses including our real estate investment programs and coinvestment activities subject us to performance and real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flow and impact our ability to raise capital for future investments

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our investment management business line within our real estate investments segment can be volatile primarily because the management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements in the event that any of the investment programs that our investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2019 we had committed 721 million to fund future coinvestments in our real estate investments segment approximately 463 million of which is expected to be funded during 2020 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to 

 

our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our i nvestment m anagement line of business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments 

selective investment in real estate projects is critical to our development services business strategy within our real estate investments segment and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2019 we had 16 real estate projects consolidated in our financial statements in addition as of december 31 2019 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 70 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 1765 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 501 million as of december 31 2019 we also had guarantees of 218 million in our uk development business which relate to our share of certain cost overrun guarantees of unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries in our us development business with outstanding balances of 66 million

during the ordinary course of business within our development services business line we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee

the success of our global workplace solutions segment depends on our ability to enter into mutually beneficial contracts deliver high quality levels of service and accurately assess working capital requirements

contracts for our global workplace solutions clients often include complex terms regarding payment of fees risk transfer liability limitations termination due diligence and transition timeframe further the facilities management and project management businesses within our global workplace solutions segment are often impacted by transition activities in the first year of a contract as well as the timing of starting operations on these large client contracts if we are unable to negotiate contracts with our clients in a timely manner and on mutually beneficial terms or there is a delay in becoming fully operational our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted further if we fail to deliver the high quality levels of service expected by our clients it may result in reputational and financial damage and could impact our ability to retain existing clients and attract new clients

the success of our global workplace solutions segment also requires us to accurately model the working capital needs of this business should we fail to accurately assess working capital requirements the cash flow generated by this business may be adversely impacted in addition if we do not accurately assess the creditworthiness of a client or if a client’s creditworthiness changes during the term of the contract we could potentially be unable to collect on any outstanding payments

a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business depends upon our relationships with us government sponsored enterprises

a significant portion of our loan origination and servicing business depends upon our relationship with the federal national mortgage association or fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation or freddie mac collectively the government sponsored enterprises or gses numerous pieces of legislation seeking various types of changes designed to reform the gses and the us housing finance system have been introduced in congress including among other things changes to the role the gses play in the us housing finance system and the winding down or conservatorship of fannie mae and freddie mac over a period of years legislation which curtails the gses activities andor alters the structure or existence of the gses if enacted may result in a significant 

 

decrease in our loan origination and servicing revenue and could have a significant impact on our loan origination and servicing business further as an approved sellerservicer for the gses we are required to comply with various eligibility criteria and are required to originate and service loans in accordance with their individual program requirements failure to comply with these requirements may result in termination or withdrawal of our approval to sell and service the gses loans our status as an approved sellerservicer may be terminated by the applicable gse at any time for cause 

our investments in our flexible workspace offering hana may prove to be unsuccessful  

while we have taken a measured approach regarding our investment into our flexible workspace offering hana there is a possibility that these investments will prove to be unsuccessful given our measured approach we believe the impact to our overall business would not be material at this time but we expect to continue opening new hana locations during the course of 2020 as this product offering expands the potential impact to our overall financial condition will increase should these locations be unsuccessful we may not earn a positive return on the capital invested and we may incur future operating losses associated with the cost of operating leases required for this business

we may be subject to actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

similar to other global services companies with different business lines and a broad client base we may be subject to potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of our services for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions in certain cases we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our clients in such situations our policies are designed to give full disclosure and transparency to all parties as well as implement appropriate barriers on informationsharing and other activities to ensure each party’s interests are protected however there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in every case if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations there could be an adverse effect on our business or reputation regardless of whether any such claims have merit in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that potential conflicts of interest will not adversely affect us

infrastructure disruptions may disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients

our ability to conduct a global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located this may include disruptions as a result of political instability public health crises attacks on our information technology systems terrorist attacks interruptions or delays in services from thirdparty data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers employee errors or malfeasance building defects utility outages and natural disasters such as fires earthquakes floods and hurricanes the infrastructure disruptions we may experience as a result of such disasters could also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of the real estate investments we make through our investment management and development services businesses

the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by people daily we also manage the critical facilities including data centers that our clients rely on to serve the public and their customers where unplanned downtime could potentially disrupt other parts of their businesses or society as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters building defects terrorist attacks mass shootings or infrastructure disruptions can result in significant loss of life or injury and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm

 

our policies procedures and programs to safeguard the health safety and security of our employees and others may not be adequate 

we have more than 100000 employees as well as independent contractors working in over 100 countries we have undertaken to implement what we believe to be best practices to safeguard the health safety and security of our employees independent contractors clients and others at our worksites however if these policies procedures and programs are not adequate or employees do not receive related adequate training or follow them for any reason the consequences may be severe to us including serious injury or loss of life which could impair our operations and cause us to incur significant legal liability or fines as well as reputational damage our insurance may not cover or may be insufficient to cover any legal liability or fines that we incur for health safety or security incidents

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could harm our business

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business political economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter particularly those that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a proportionally larger effect on our financial condition and results of operations

risks related to our indebtedness

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

as of december 31 2019 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 our interest expense was 1030 million

our debt instruments impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to







 









our credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement of 200x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt as defined in the credit agreement less available cash as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated ebitda of 425x and in the case of the first four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a qualified acquisition as defined in the credit agreement 475x as of the end of each fiscal quarter on this basis our coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense was 2262x for the year ended december 31 2019 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to consolidated ebitda was 044x as of december 31 2019 our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee or arrc has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate or sofr is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to usdlibor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from usdlibor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to usdlibor establishing a replacement rate for libor in this manner may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made on our debt if libor was available in its current form

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness in addition in the event of a creditratings downgrade our ability to borrow and the costs of such borrowings could be adversely affected 

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments in addition moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades of them may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings 

risks related to our information technology cybersecurity and data protection

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market

our business relies heavily on information technology including solutions provided by third parties to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients if we are unable to effectively execute or maintain our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform our ability to deliver highquality services may be materially impaired in addition we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or 

 

technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays or fail to exploit new technologies then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted similarly our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business failure to successfully provide such tools and systems or ensure that employees have properly adopted them could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes 

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us

security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks as well as that of thirdparty vendors could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs which could cause material harm to our business and financial results in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees contractors and vendors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations although we and our vendors continue to implement new security measures and regularly conduct employee training our information technology and infrastructure may nevertheless be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions an increasing number of companies that rely on information and technology networks have disclosed breaches of their security some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target to date we have not yet experienced any cybersecurity breaches that have been material either individually or in the aggregate however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent any material events from occurring in the future

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect sensitive information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation china’s cyber security law various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information including the california consumer privacy act and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us

a significant actual or potential theft loss corruption exposure fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients harm our relationships with contractors and vendors damage our reputation result in the loss of a competitive advantage impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting which could adversely affect our business revenues competitive position and investor confidence additionally we rely on third parties to support our information and technology networks including cloud storage solution providers and as a result have less direct control over our data and information technology systems such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or our infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are 

 

vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyberattacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism employee errors or malfeasance or other events which are beyond our control with respect to cyberattacks and viruses these pose growing threats to many companies and we have been a target and may continue to be a target of such threats which could expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm to our business and financial results  in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients contractors and vendors and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel furthermore while we have certain business interruption insurance coverage and various contractual arrangements that can serve to mitigate costs damages and liabilities any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers business partners and other third parties we have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially adversely affected 

our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected

legal and regulatory related risks

we are subject to various litigation and regulatory risks and may face financial liabilities andor damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or regulatory proceedings 

our businesses are exposed to various litigation and regulatory risks especially within our valuations business although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures additionally our insurance policies may not cover us in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct accordingly an adverse result in a litigation against us or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore an adverse result in regulatory proceedings if applicable could result in fines or other liabilities or adversely impact our operations in addition we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients as a result allegations against us or the announcement of a regulatory investigation involving us irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation or investigation may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes we may incur significant financial penalties

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec financial industry regulatory authority or finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to 

 

disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental employment laws and antibribery antimoney laundering and corruption laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations us state wageandhour laws the us fcpa and the uk bribery act failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis resulted in increased government and legislative activity and we expect that we will continue to see the introduction of new legislation and additional changes to rules and regulations in the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects

we also operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 

risks related to our internal controls and accounting policies 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and our results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls as disclosed in part ii item 9a during the fourth quarter of 2019 management identified several material weaknesses in internal control related to our global workplace solutions segment in the europe middle east  africa region or gws emea management concluded that during 2019 as gws emea increased in complexity and grew in both size and scale management did not prioritize an appropriate level of oversight a sufficient number of capable resources or training for control preparers and reviewers to address internal controls over financial reporting as a result even though a material misstatement was not identified in the gws emea financial statements it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the gws emea financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis and therefore management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december 31 2019 we are committed to remediating the gws emea material weaknesses in a timely manner and have begun the process of executing remediation plans these measures will result in additional administrative expenses related to enhanced training and hiring of additional personnel internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses in a timely manner or are otherwise unable to maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our stock price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations

as of december 31 2019 we occupied offices excluding affiliates in the following geographical regions

 



 

some of our offices house employees from more than one of our business segments ie an office might house employees from all three of our business segments as such we have provided above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting or triple counting our offices

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business we believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefore as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated

management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

tableend

overview 

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm based on 2019 revenue with leading global market positions in our leasing property sales occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses as of december 31 2019 we operated in more than 530 offices worldwide and have more than 100000 employees excluding independent affiliates

our business is focused on providing services to real estate occupiers and investors for occupiers we provide facilities management project management transaction both property sales and leasing and consulting services among others for investors we provide capital markets property sales mortgage origination sales and servicing leasing investment management property management valuation and development services among others we provide services under the following brand names “cbre” real estate advisory and outsourcing services “cbre global investors” investment management “trammell crow company” us development “telford homes” uk development and “hana” flexiblespace solutions

our revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue as occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated accountbased services from firms that meet the full spectrum of their needs nationally and globally we believe we are wellpositioned to capture a substantial share of growing market opportunities we generate revenue from both management fees large multiyear portfolio and perproject contracts and commissions on transactions our contractual feeforservices businesses generally involve occupier outsourcing including facilities and project management property management investment management appraisalvaluation and loan servicing in addition our leasing services business line is largely recurring in nature over time

in 2019 we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients including more than 90 of the fortune 100 companies we have been an sp 500 company since 2006 and in 2019 we were ranked 146 on the fortune 500 we have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the lipsey company survey for 19 years in a row including 2020 we have also been rated a world’s most ethical company by the ethisphere institute for seven consecutive years including 2020 and are included in the dow jones world sustainability index and the bloomberg gender equality index

critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition

to recognize revenue in a transaction with a customer we evaluate the five steps of the accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue recognition framework 1 identify the contract 2 identify the performance obligationss in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and 5 recognize revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five step framework understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time amount and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires significant judgement these significant judgements include i determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer ii applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time iii estimating how and when contingencies or other forms of variable consideration will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue and iv determining whether we control third party services before they are transferred to the customer in order to appropriately recognize the 

 

associated fees on either a gross or net basis the timing and amount of revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue incentivebased management fees development fees and third party fees associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management services for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k or this annual report 

goodwill and other intangible assets

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in accordance with the “ intangibles – goodwill and other ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic 350 we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of our reporting units to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is needed we are permitted to assess based on qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test if not we do not need to apply the quantitative test the qualitative test is elective and we can go directly to the quantitative test rather than making a morelikelythannot assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors when performing a quantitative test we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis

for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized

 

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 201 9 and 201 8 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code including a decrease to the us corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 and a onetime transition tax ie toll charge or the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 we are paying the federal tax liability for the transition tax in annual interestfree installments over a period of eight years through 2025 as allowed by the tax act 

our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items

see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes

new accounting pronouncements

see new accounting pronouncements discussion within note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report

seasonality

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend

inflation

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by inflation however to date we believe that general inflation has not had a material impact upon our operations

items affecting comparability

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future

 

macroeconomic conditions 

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels and changes in interest rates the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business

compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved additionally our contractual revenues have continued to increase primarily as a result of growth in our outsourcing business and we believe this contractual revenue should help offset the negative impacts that macroeconomic deterioration could have on other parts of our business nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our consolidated operations and financial condition

commercial real estate markets in the united states have generally been marked by increased demand for space falling vacancies and higher rents since 2010 during this time healthy us property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals including higher occupancy rates and rents broad lowcost credit availability and increased institutional capital allocations to commercial real estate in 2019 us sales market activity improved from 2018 levels as significant capital continued to be targeted at commercial real estate and relatively lowcost financing remained plentiful the market for commercial real estate leasing was solid in 2019 though leasing market volumes weakened somewhat in the latter stages of the year

in europe leasing activity was relatively stable in 2019 sales market volumes were soft for much of the year but rebounded strongly in the fourth quarter the united kingdom’s economy and property market were generally solid from the june 2016 referendum to leave the european union through 2018 however in 2019 continued uncertainty throughout the year about the date and the terms on which the united kingdom would leave the european union led to lower lease and sales volumes the december 2019 united kingdom general election and exit from the european union on january 31 2020 brought some clarity and a return of investor confidence but uncertainty remains over the united kingdom’s longterm economic and trade relationship with the european union

in asia pacific leasing activity declined significantly in 2019 amid rising geopolitical uncertainty and slowing regional economies however investment activity was more resilient declining only modestly from 2018 levels asia pacific investors continue to be a significant source of real estate investment capital in the region and globally

real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate actively managed public real estate equity funds and programs have been pressured by a shift in investor preferences from active to passive portfolio strategies

the performance of our global real estate services and investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and solid job creation stable global credit markets and positive business and investor sentiment

effects of acquisitions 

we historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world on october 1 2019 we acquired telford homes plc telford to expand our real estate development business outside the united states telford acquisition a leading developer of multifamily residential properties in the london area telford is reported in our real estate investments segment telford was acquired for £ 2671 million or  3285 million along with the assumption of 1107 million £900 million of debt and the acquisition of cash from telford of 79 million £64 million the telford acquisition was funded with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

 

on june 12 2018 we acquired facilitysource through a stock purchase and merger agreement with its stockholders including facilitysource holdings llc wp x finance lp and warburg pincus x partners lp facilitysource acquisition facilitysource which is reported in our global workplace solutions segment was acquired to help us build a techenabled supply chain capability for the occupier outsourcing industry which would drive meaningfully differentiated outcomes for leading occupiers of real estate the n et purchase price was approximately 2665 million in cash with 2630 million paid in 2018 and 35 million paid in 2019 we financed the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform or independent affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest in early 2020 we acquired leading local facilities management firms in spain and italy and a us firm that helps companies reduce telecommunications costs

during 2019 we completed eight infill acquisitions a leading advanced analytics software company based in the united kingdom a commercial and residential real estate appraisal firm headquartered in florida our former affiliate in omaha a project management firm in australia a valuation and consulting business in switzerland a leading project management firm in israel a fullservice real estate firm in san antonio with a focus on retail office medical office and land and a debtfocused real estate investment management business in the united kingdom during 2018 we completed six infill acquisitions the largest of which was the purchase of the remaining 50 equity interest in our longstanding new england joint venture we also acquired a retail leasing and property management firm in australia two firms in israel our former affiliate and a majority interest in a local facilities management provider a commercial real estate services provider in san antonio and a provider of real estate and facilities consulting services to healthcare companies across the united states 

we believe strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position – or expand our capabilities – within targeted markets or business lines in general however most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating income and net income as a result of transactionrelated expenditures including severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs as well as costs and charges associated with integrating the acquired business and integrating its financial and accounting systems into our own

our acquisition agreements often require us to pay deferred andor contingent purchase price payments subject to the acquired company achieving certain performance metrics andor the passage of time as well as other conditions as of december 31 2019 we have accrued deferred consideration totaling 1117 million which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report

international operations

we continue to monitor developments related to the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the european union and the uncertainty of the longterm economic and trade relationship between the united kingdom and european union the continued uncertainty has the potential to impact our businesses in the united kingdom and the rest of europe particularly sales and leasing activity in the united kingdom in addition any associated currency volatility could impact our results of operations we are also monitoring the impact of a coronavirus that emerged in wuhan china in december 2019 on business conditions and operations in china and other regions in which we operate

as we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our real estate investments business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management or aum as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe in addition our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings

 

during the year ended december 31 201 9  approximately 42  of our business was transacted in nonus dollar currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan czech koruna danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee israeli shekel japanese yen korean won mexican peso new zealand dollar polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies us dollars in thousands 

 



 

although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results for example we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2019 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 36 million had the eurotous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2019 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 95 million these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into us dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which affect the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 dollars in thousands  

 



 

fee revenue and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use these measures in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we generally use these nongaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of fee revenue and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients we believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company’s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business

 

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt income taxes depreciation and amortization and intangible asset impairments  amounts shown for adjusted ebitda further remove from ebitda the impact of certain cash and noncash items related to acquisitions certain carried interest incentive compensation expense reversal to align with the timing of associated revenue costs associated with our reorganization including costsavings initiatives and other nonrecurring costs we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending 

adjusted ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments this measure may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments we also use adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs

adjusted ebitda is calculated as follows dollars in thousands

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2019 increased by 26 billion or 120 as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher revenue in our global workplace solutions segment up 145 and improved revenue in our advisory services segment due to property and advisory project management revenue up 96 as well as 

 

increased advisory leasing up 62   advisory sales up 76 and commercial mortgage origination activity up 127   h igher revenue in our real estate investments segment up 235 driven by the telford acquisition also contributed to the increase  f oreign currency translation had a 2  1  negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by weakness in the argentine peso australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and indian rupee 

our cost of revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 22 billion or 136 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global workplace solutions segment in addition our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in advisory leasing and sales transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense higher costs in our property and advisory project management business as well as higher costs in our real estate investments segment due to the telford acquisition also contributed to the increase these items were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation which had a 22 positive impact on total cost of revenue during the year ended december 31 2019 cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue increased from 771 for the year ended december 31 2018 to 782 for the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by our mix of revenue with revenue from our global workplace solutions segment which has a lower margin than our other revenue streams comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior period

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 128 million or 28 during the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 this decrease was primarily attributable to 274 million of lower amortization expense largely associated with intangibles from prior acquisitions the decrease in amortization expense was partially offset by a rise in depreciation expense of 146 million during the year ended december 31 2019 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures

during the year ended december 31 2019 we recorded an intangible asset impairment of 898 million in our real estate investments segment this noncash writeoff resulted from a review of the anticipated cash flows and the decrease in assets under management in our public securities business driven in part by continued industrywide shift in investor preference for passive investment programs

our consolidated interest expense net of interest income decreased by 129 million or 131 for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the same period in 2018 this decrease was primarily driven by the early redemption in full of the 8000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 500 senior notes in the first quarter of 2018 lower interest expense associated with the term loans under our credit agreement driven by more favorable interest rates stemming from our amendment to our credit agreement in 2019 also contributed to the decrease

we reported consolidated net income of 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 on revenue of 213 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 6971 million on revenue of 186 billion for the year ended december 31 2017

a roll forward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31 2019 is as follows dollars in billions

 



 

aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide or participate in oversight investment management services and other advice and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market not the basis for determining our management fees our assets under management consist of





our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers

a roll forward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31 2018 is as follows dollars in billions

 



 

we describe above how we calculate aum also as noted above our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers

liquidity and capital resources

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2020 include up to approximately 385 million of anticipated capital expenditures net of tenant concessions as of december 31 2019 we had aggregate commitments of 721 million to fund future coinvestments in our real estate investments business 463 million of which is expected to be funded in 2020 additionally as of december 31 2019 we are committed to fund 501 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our real estate investments business which we may be required to fund at any time as of december 31 2019 we had 28 billion of borrowings available under our revolving credit facility

we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and general investment requirements including strategic infill acquisitions and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future and at a minimum for the next 12 months we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments as we have done in the past with new debt instruments at interest rates maturities and terms we deem attractive we may also from time to time in our sole discretion purchase redeem or retire our existing senior notes through tender offers in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise

as noted above we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are generally comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness if our cash flow is insufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all

 

the second longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 201 9 and 201 8  we had accrued  1117 million  416 million of which was a current liability and  1363 million  417 million of which was a current liability respectively of deferred purchase consideration which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

lastly in october 2016 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2500 million of our class a common stock over three years as of december 31 2018 we spent 1610 million to repurchase 3980656 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of 4043 during the month of january 2019 under the october 2016 program we spent 451 million to repurchase an additional 1144449 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of 3938 in february 2019 our board of directors authorized a new program for the company to repurchase up to 3000 million of our class a common stock over three years effective march 11 2019 the previous program terminated upon the effectiveness of the new program in both august 2019 and november 2019 our board of directors authorized an additional 1000 million under our new program bringing the total authorized amount under the new program to a total of 5000 million as of march 2 2020

during the year ended december 31 2019 under the march 2019 program we spent 1000 million to repurchase 1936458 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of 5164 as of march 2 2020 we had 4000 million of capacity remaining under our current stock repurchase program our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand and we intend to continue funding future stock repurchases with existing cash the timing of future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions and other factors

historical cash flows

operating activities

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 921 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating performance partially offset by lower distribution of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31 2019

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 an increase of 2368 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to improved operating performance as well as a higher distribution of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31 2018

investing activities

net cash used in investing activities totaled 7210 million for the year ended december 31 2019 an increase of 1603 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 this increase was largely driven by an increase of 657 million in capital expenditures and higher amounts paid for acquisitions driven by the telford acquisition during the year ended december 31 2019 additionally higher contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries and lower distributions received from unconsolidated subsidiaries during the year ended december 31 2019 contributed to the higher net use of cash in investing activities

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 2719 million for the year ended december 31 2019 a decrease of 2347 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2018 this decrease was primarily due to the impact of the full redemption of the 8000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 500 senior notes including 200 million premium during the year ended december 31 2018 this was partially offset by the impact of higher net borrowings of 5527 million from our senior term loans during the year ended december 31 2018 and the repayment of debt assumed in the telford acquisition of 1107 million during the year ended december 31 2019

net cash used in financing activities totaled 5066 million for the year ended december 31 2018 a decrease of 1211 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 this decrease was primarily due to 11 billion of higher net borrowings from our senior term loans during the year ended december 31 2018 largely offset by the full redemption of the 8000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 500 senior notes including 200 million premium as well as the 1610 million repurchase of our common stock during the year ended december 31 2018

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes

 

exchange rates 

our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional reporting currency which is us dollars see the discussion of international operations which is included in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “international operations” and is incorporated by reference herein

interest rates

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt historically we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2019 we do not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements

the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 7455 million at december 31 2019 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 4875 senior notes and 525 senior notes were 6707 million and 4783 million respectively at december 31 2019

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2019 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 75 million on pretax income and a decrease of 75 million in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2019

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 2013 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission we acquired telford homes plc during 2019 as defined in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements and excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 telford homes plc’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of 5254 million and total revenues of 975 million included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2019

based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 due to the fact that material weaknesses existed in the company’s internal control over financial reporting as further described below a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis

our independent registered public accounting firm kpmg llp who audited the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k has expressed an adverse report on the operating effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting kpmg llp’s report is included herein on page 2

 

material weaknesses identified relating to global workplace solutions segment – europe middle east  africa r egion gws emea 

based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2019 due to the fact that material weaknesses existed in gws emea

as of december 31 2019 we determined that the severity of control failures isolated to gws emea led management to conclude that the following material weaknesses existed in the internal control environment in gws emea











consequently there were control failures for gws emea in the areas of revenue and receivables balance sheet account reconciliations journal entries and general information technology controls during 2019 as gws emea increased in complexity and grew in both size and scale management did not prioritize an appropriate level of oversight a sufficient number of capable resources or training for control owners to address internal controls over financial reporting as a result even though a material misstatement was not identified in the gws emea financial statements it was determined that there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in the gws emea financial statements would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis

the company’s plan to remediate the material weaknesses

the company with the oversight from the audit committee of the board of directors is committed to remediating the gws emea material weaknesses in a timely manner we have begun the process of executing remediation plans that address the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting we are engaged in various stages of remedial actions to address the material weaknesses described above we are using both internal and external resources to assist in the following actions

we conducted the required evaluation and our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as defined by securities exchange act rule 13a15e were not effective as of december 31 2019 to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level because of the material weaknesses described above

notwithstanding such material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting our management concluded that our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form 10k present fairly in all material respects the company’s financial position results of operations and cash flows as of the dates and for the periods presented in conformity with us gaap

changes in internal control over financial reporting 

other than the material weaknesses described above there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended december 31 2019 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting our remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses are ongoing

the americas 

the americas is our largest reporting segment comprised of operations throughout the united states and canada as well as key markets in latin america 

most of our operations are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre inc our mortgage loan origination sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary operating under the name cbre capital markets inc or cbre capital markets and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre limited and our operations in latin america are operated through various indirect whollyowned subsidiaries

within our americas segment we organize our services into several business lines as further described below

leasing services

we provide strategic advice and execution for owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing of office industrial and retail space we generate significant repeat business from existing clients which for example accounted for approximately 66 of our us leasing activity in 2018 including referrals from other parts of our business we believe we are a market leader for the provision of these services in most top us metropolitan statistical areas as defined by the us census bureau including atlanta austin chicago dallas denver houston los angeles miamisouth florida new york philadelphia phoenix san francisco and seattle

capital markets 

we offer clients property sales and mortgage and structured financing services the tight integration of these services helps to meet marketplace demand for comprehensive solutions during 2018 we closed approximately 1475 billion of capital markets transactions in the americas including 1001 billion of property sales transactions and 475 billion of mortgage originations and loan sales

we are the leading property sales advisor in the united states accounting for approximately 16 of investment sales transactions greater than 25 million across office industrial retail multifamily and hotel properties in 2018 according to real capital analytics our mortgage brokerage business brokers originate and service commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms national and regional banks credit companies insurance companies and pension funds in the americas our mortgage loan origination volume in 2018 was 469 billion including approximately 211 billion for us government sponsored enterprises gses most of the gse loans were financed through revolving warehouse credit lines through a cbre subsidiary that is dedicated exclusively for this purpose and were substantially risk mitigated by either obtaining a contractual purchase commitment from the gse or confirming a forwardtrade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgagebacked security that will be secured by the loan we advised on the sale of approximately 06 billion of mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2018 we also oversee a loan servicing portfolio which totaled approximately 162 billion in the americas approximately 201 billion globally at yearend 2018 

our real estate services professionals both leasing and capital markets are compensated primarily through commissions which are payable upon completion of an assignment this mitigates the effect of compensation our largest expense on our operating margins during difficult market conditions we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity as well as investments in support resources including professional development and training market research and information technology branding and marketing

competition

we compete across a variety of business lines within the commercial real estate industry including property management facilities management project and transaction management tenant and landlord leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and structured finance real estate investment management valuation loan servicing development services and proprietary research each business line is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2018 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets property types and services we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global national regional or local basis or within a market segment companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their outsourcing offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments and property ownersdevelopers that selfperform real estate services investment banking firms investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital and accountingconsulting firms that advise on real estate strategies some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as jones lang lasalle incorporated or jll cushman  wakefield colliers international group inc savills plc and newmark group inc marketsegment specialists such as eastdil secured hff lp marcus  millichap inc and walker  dunlop and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business such as iss and sodexo in addition in recent years providers of coworking space such as wework iwgregus industrious and knotel have offered services directly to occupiers providing competition particularly for smaller space requirements these coworking providers also compete with our new flexspace subsidiary cbre hana which we announced in late 2018

seasonality

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend

employees

at december 31 2018 excluding our independent affiliates we had more than 90000 employees worldwide approximately 37 of whose costs are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our occupier outsourcing and property management lines of business at december 31 2018 approximately 9 of our employees worldwide were subject to collective bargaining agreements

environmental matters

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry in general and us environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our global investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that later become material may also adversely affect our business

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity pressure fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent declines in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal or political uncertainty market volatility declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions or the perception that such disruptions may occur that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty for example uncertainty with respect to the political and economic impact of the united kingdom’s announced departure from the european union and the continued negotiations related thereto has caused and may continue to cause market volatility and currency fluctuations and adversely impact our clients’ and consumers’ confidence which may result in a deterioration in our uk and other european businesses if leasing and investing activity slows down furthermore if such withdrawal from the european union has an adverse economic impact on the united kingdom our uk operations may experience a prolonged period of decreased sales and leasing activity 

 

adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in particular the performance of commercial real estate assets located in the united kingdom and access to funds from investors located in the united kingdom may be adversely impacted by any weakness in the british economy following withdrawal from the european union or the perception that such weakness may occur in addition our development and investment strategy often entails making coinvestments alongside our investor clients during an economic downturn capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our capital markets business 

the performance of our property management business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform this is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties rent collections may be affected by many factors including 1 real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally 2 our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and 3 the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed economic conditions  

in continental europe and asia pacific the economies in certain countries where we operate can be fragile which may adversely affect our financial performance

economic political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future as a result any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on thencurrent conditions and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition

our global investment management development services and capital markets including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition and acquisition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made

our operations are subject to social political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2018 approximately 43 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan czech koruna danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee israeli shekel japanese yen korean won mexican peso new zealand dollar polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our global investment management business revenue and earnings over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of 

 

currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for example uncertainty with respect to the political and economic impact of the united kingdom’s announced withdrawal from the european union has caused and may continue to cause additional volatility in international currency markets and any longterm adverse economic consequences of such withdrawal may create additional volatility in the international currency markets in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

in addition to exposure to foreign currency fluctuations our international operations expose us to international economic trends as well as foreign governmental policy measures additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors





















we maintain anticorruption and antimoneylaundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions embargoes and other importexport controls throughout the company however coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have penetrated and seek to continue to enter into emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there

 

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer while certain of our executive officers and key employees are subject to longterm compensatory arrangements from time to time which include retention incentives and various restrictive covenants there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all key members of our senior management we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business we use equity incentives and signon and retention bonuses to help attract retain and incentivize key personnel as competition is significant for the services of such personnel the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel furthermore stockholder influence on our compensation practices including our ability to issue equity compensation may decrease our ability to offer attractive compensation to key personnel and make recruiting retaining and incentivizing such personnel more difficult if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer

we have numerous local regional and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation fragmentation or innovation could lead to significant future competition

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including property management facilities management project and transaction management tenant and landlord leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and structured finance flexible space solutions real estate investment management valuation loan servicing development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2018 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines

depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate services providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments developers flexible space providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions 

although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve in addition disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively furthermore we are substantially dependent on longterm client relationships and on revenue received for services under various service agreements many of these agreements may be canceled by the client for any reason with as little as 30 to 60 days’ notice as is typical in the industry

 

in this competitive market if we are unable to maintain longterm client relationships or are otherwise unable to retain existing clients and develop new clients our business results of operations andor financial condition may be materially adversely affected there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future

a significant component of our growth over time has been generated by acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company’s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology and accounting and management services

we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits including enhanced or more stable revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities cost synergies tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted net income per share achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated whether we will experience greaterthanexpected attrition from professionals licensed or associated with the acquired companies and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business financial condition and operating results

if we are unable to manage the organizational challenges associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objectives

our size and scale present significant management and organizational challenges it might become increasingly difficult to maintain effective standards across a large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operations and effectively communicate our core values policies and procedures strategies and goals particularly given our worldwide operations the size and scope of our operations increase the possibility that we will have employees who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose us to business or reputational risks despite our efforts to train them and maintain controls to prevent such instances for example employee misconduct could involve inappropriate behavior directed at an individual’s gender appearance ethnicity or religious beliefs asking for a personal payment in exchange for awarding a company contract accepting or giving inappropriate or excessive gifts or misappropriating property or confidential or proprietary information or technology belonging to the company our clients or third parties if we are not successful in continuing to develop and implement the processes and tools designed to manage our enterprise and instill our culture and core values into all of our employees our reputation and ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired in addition from time to time we have made and may continue to make changes to our operating model including how we are organized as the needs and size of our business change if we do not successfully implement any such changes our business and results of operation may be negatively impacted

 

our brand and reputation are key assets of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 

our brand and reputation are key assets of our business and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of service trustworthiness business practices management workplace culture financial condition our response to unexpected events and other subjective qualities negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters even if related to seemingly isolated incidents and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential clients which could make it difficult for us to attract new clients and maintain existing ones negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities or circumstances including handling of client or employee complaints regulatory compliance such as compliance with applicable sanctions the foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and other antibribery antimoney laundering and corruption laws the use and protection of client and other sensitive information and from actions taken by regulators the media activists competitors or others in response to such conduct negative publicity or claims about us on social media channels can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand

our brand and reputation may also be harmed by actions taken by third parties that are outside our control for example any shortcoming or controversy related to a thirdparty vendor may be attributed to us thus damaging our reputation and brand value and increasing the attractiveness of our competitors’ services also business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners may adversely affect the value of our investments result in litigation or regulatory action against us and otherwise damage our reputation and brand adverse developments with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us furthermore as a company with headquarters and operations located in the united states a negative perception of the united states arising from its political or other positions could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perceptions or publicity would materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability

the protection of our brand including related trademarks may require the expenditure of significant financial and operational resources moreover the steps we take to protect our brand may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our trademarks even when we detect infringement or misappropriation of our trademarks we may not be able to enforce all such trademarks any unauthorized use by third parties of our brand may adversely affect our brand furthermore as we continue to expand our business especially internationally there is a risk we may face claims of infringement or other alleged violations of thirdparty intellectual property rights which may restrict us from leveraging our brand in a manner consistent with our business goals

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could harm our business

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition

 

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities in our global investment management as well as development services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flow 

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2018 we had committed 537 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business approximately 243 million of which is expected to be funded during 2019 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our global investment management business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2018 we had seven real estate projects consolidated in our financial statements in addition as of december 31 2018 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 65 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 933 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 347 million as of december 31 2018 we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of 84 million

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can be volatile period over period primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable

we have debt and related debt service obligations as of december 31 2018 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was 18 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 our interest expense was 1073 million

 

our debt instruments impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 















our credit agreement requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement of 200x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt as defined in the credit agreement less available cash as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated ebitda of 425x and in the case of the first four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a qualified acquisition as defined in the credit agreement 475x as of the end of each fiscal quarter on this basis our coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense was 2061x for the year ended december 31 2018 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to consolidated ebitda was 061x as of december 31 2018 our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments

in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the authority that regulates libor announced it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of libor after 2021 the alternative reference rates committee arrc has proposed that the secured overnight financing rate sofr is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to usdlibor for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to usdlibor the arrc has proposed a paced market transition plan to sofr from usdlibor and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to usdlibor we have debt instruments including our credit agreement that are indexed to usdlibor and are monitoring this activity and evaluating the related risks

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness in addition in the event of a creditratings downgrade our ability to borrow and the costs of such borrowings could be adversely affected 

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments in addition moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades of them may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings 

 

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly 

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business political economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to various litigation and regulatory risks and may face financial liabilities andor damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or regulatory proceedings 

our businesses are exposed to various litigation and regulatory risks although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures additionally our insurance policies may not cover us in the event of grossly negligent or intentionally wrongful conduct accordingly an adverse result in a litigation against us or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore an adverse result in regulatory proceedings if applicable could result in fines or other liabilities or adversely impact our operations in addition we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients as a result allegations against us or the announcement of a regulatory investigation involving us irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation or investigation may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects

the concentration of business with corporate clients can increase business risk and our business can be adversely affected due to the loss of certain of these clients 

we value the expansion of business relationships with individual corporate clients because of the increased efficiency and economics that can result from developing recurring business from performing an increasingly broad range of services for the same client although our client portfolio is highly diversified as we grow our business relationships with certain corporate clients may increase and our client portfolio may become increasingly concentrated for example part of our strategy is to increase our revenues from existing clients which may lead to an increase in corporate clients and therefore greater concentration of revenues having increasingly large and concentrated clients also can lead to greater or more concentrated risks if among other possibilities any such client 1 experiences its own financial problems 2 becomes bankrupt or insolvent which can lead to our failure to be paid for services we have previously provided or funds we have previously advanced 3 decides to reduce its operations or its real estate facilities 4 makes a change in its real estate strategy such as no longer outsourcing its real estate operations 5 decides to change its providers of real estate services or 6 mergers with another corporation or otherwise undergoes a change in control which may result in new management taking over with a different real estate philosophy or in different relationships with other real estate providers 

additionally competitive conditions particularly in connection with increasingly large clients may require us to compromise on certain contract terms with respect to the payment of fees the extent of risk transfer acting as principal rather than agent in connection with supplier relationships liability limitations credit terms and other contractual terms or in connection with disputes or potential litigation where competitive pressures result in higher levels of potential liability under our contracts the cost of operational errors and other activities for which we have indemnified our clients will be greater and may not be fully insured where we provide real estate services to firms in the financial services industry including banks and investment banks we are experiencing indirectly the increasing extent of the regulatory environment to which they are subject in the aftermath of the global financial crisis this increases the cost of doing business with them which we are not always able to pass on as a result of the additional resources and processes we are required to provide as a critical supplier

 

we may be subject to actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

similar to other global services companies with different business lines and a broad client base we may be subject to potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of our services for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions in certain cases we are also subject to fiduciary obligations to our clients in such situations our policies are designed to give full disclosure and transparency to all parties as well as implement appropriate barriers on informationsharing and other activities to ensure each party’s interests are protected however there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in every case if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations there could be an adverse effect on our business or reputation regardless of whether any such claims have merit in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that potential conflicts of interest will not adversely affect us 

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market

our business relies significantly on information technology including solutions provided by third parties to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients if we are unable to effectively execute or maintain our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform our ability to deliver highquality services may be materially impaired in addition we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays or fail to exploit new technologies then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted similarly our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business failure to successfully provide such tools and systems or ensure that employees have properly adopted them could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us 

security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs which could cause material harm to our business and financial results in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees contractors and vendors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations

although we continue to implement new security measures and regularly conduct employee training our information technology and infrastructure may nevertheless be vulnerable to cyberattacks by third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions an increasing number of companies that rely on information and technology networks have disclosed breaches of their security some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target to date we have not yet experienced any cybersecurity breaches that have been material either individually or in the aggregate however there can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent any material events from occurring in the future

 

we are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect sensitive information such as the european union’s general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may 2018 various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other personally identifiable information and data privacy and cybersecurity laws in other regions these laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us the gdpr imposes new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data and has significantly increased financial penalties for noncompliance for example failure to comply with the gdpr may lead to regulatory enforcement actions which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4 of worldwide revenues orders to discontinue certain data processing operations private lawsuits or reputational damage 

a significant actual or potential theft loss corruption exposure fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients harm our relationships with contractors and vendors damage our reputation result in the loss of a competitive advantage impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting which could adversely affect our business revenues competitive position and investor confidence additionally we rely on third parties to support our information and technology networks including cloud storage solution providers and as a result have less direct control over our data and information technology systems such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or our infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyberattacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism employee errors or malfeasance or other events which are beyond our control with respect to cyberattacks and viruses these pose growing threats to many companies and we have been a target and may continue to be a target of such threats which could expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs and cause material harm to our business and financial results in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients contractors and vendors and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel furthermore while we have certain business interruption insurance coverage and various contractual arrangements that can serve to mitigate costs damages and liabilities any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers business partners and other third parties we have business continuity and disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially adversely affected

our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected

 

infrastructure disruptions may disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients 

the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by numerous people daily as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm

our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls

the accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls we are required to provide a report from management to our stockholders on the internal controls over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls internal controls over financial reporting has inherent limitations including human error the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions and fraud because of these inherent limitations internal controls over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud if we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use we could suffer harm to our reputation incur incremental compliance costs fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations or be required to restate our financial statements and our results of operations our stock price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes we may incur significant financial penalties

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec financial industry regulatory authority or finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental employment laws and antibribery antimoney laundering and corruption laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations us state wageandhour laws the us fcpa and the uk bribery act failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters

 

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations which we expect will continue into the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we also operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate a number of countries where we do business including the united states and many countries in the european union have implemented and are considering implementing changes in relevant tax accounting and other laws regulations and interpretations for example on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law the “tax cuts and jobs act” or tax act that significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the tax act’s “base erosion and antiabuse tax” provisions or regulations issued thereunder could adversely impact our ongoing effective tax rate by imposing taxes on our intercompany transactions and limiting our ability to deduct certain expenses our future effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items in addition from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

we occupied the follo wing offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2018 

 



 

some of our offices house employees from our global investment management and development services segments as well as employees from our other business segments we have provided above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting our global investment management and development services offices

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases

we do not own any of these offices

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business we believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefor as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated

management’s discussion and analysis of fina ncial condition and results of operations 

tableend

overview 

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm based on 2018 revenue with leading global market positions in our leasing property sales occupier outsourcing and valuation businesses as of december 31 2018 we operated in more than 480 offices worldwide with over 90000 employees excluding independent affiliates 

our business is focused on providing services to both occupiers of and investors in real estate for occupiers we provide facilities management project management transaction both property sales and tenant leasing and consulting services among others for investors we provide capital markets property sales commercial mortgage brokerage loan origination and servicing leasing investment management property management valuation and development services among others we provide commercial real estate services under the “cbre” brand name investment management services under the “cbre global investors” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow company” brand name

our revenue mix has shifted in recent years toward more contractual revenue as occupiers and investors increasingly prefer to purchase integrated accountbased services from firms that meet the full spectrum of their needs nationally and globally we believe we are wellpositioned to capture a growing share of this business we generate revenue from both management fees large multiyear portfolio and perproject contracts and commissions on transactions our contractual feeforservices businesses generally involve occupier outsourcing including facilities and project management property management investment management appraisalvaluation and loan servicing in addition our leasing services business line is largely recurring in nature over time 

in 2018 we generated revenue from a highly diversified base of clients including more than 90 of the fortune 100 companies we have been an sp 500 company since 2006 and in 2018 we were ranked 207 on the fortune 500 we have been voted the most recognized commercial real estate brand in the lipsey company survey for 18 years in a row including 2019 we have also been rated a world’s most ethical company by the ethisphere institute for six consecutive years

critical accounting policies

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition

to recognize revenue in a transaction with a customer we evaluate the five steps of the accounting standards codification topic 606 revenue recognition framework 1 identify the contract 2 identify the performance obligationss in the contract 3 determine the transaction price 4 allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations and 5 recognize revenue when or as the performance obligations are satisfied

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with this five step framework understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time amount and method to recognize revenue for each transaction requires significant judgement these significant judgements include i determining what point in time or what measure of progress depicts the transfer of control to the customer ii applying the series guidance to certain performance obligations satisfied over time iii estimating how and when contingencies or other forms of variable consideration will impact the timing and amount of recognition of revenue and iv determining whether we control third party services before they are transferred to the customer in order to appropriately recognize the associated fees on either a gross or net basis the timing and amount of revenue recognition in a period could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue incentivebased management fees development fees and third party fees associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management services for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k or this annual report 

 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews 

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status in accordance with the “ intangibles – goodwill and other ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic 350 we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment with respect to any of our reporting units to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is needed we are permitted to assess based on qualitative factors whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would conduct a quantitative goodwill impairment test if not we do not need to apply the quantitative test the qualitative test is elective and we can go directly to the quantitative test rather than making a morelikelythannot assessment based on an evaluation of qualitative factors when performing a quantitative test we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management’s judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2018 and 2017 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code including but not limited to 







in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 “ income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act ” which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date in march 2018 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu 201805 “ income taxes topic 740 amendments to sec paragraphs pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin no 118 ” which added sec guidance related to sab 118 

our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a net expense of 1434 million attributable to the tax act including a provisional amount representing our estimate of the us federal and state tax impact of the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings as of december 31 2017 during 2018 we continued to analyze the impact of the tax act and interpreted the additional guidance issued by the us treasury department the internal revenue service and other standardsetting bodies our provision for income taxes for 2018 included a net expense trueup of 133 million associated with the tax act based upon our final analysis as of december 31 2018 we have completed our analysis and the final net expense associated with the tax act was 1567 million 

our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items

our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated 21 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax in connection with the enactment of the tax act or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations while federal and state current income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the tax act we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes state income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss that would be due when cash is actually repatriated to the us because those foreign earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the business or may be remitted substantially free of any additional local taxes the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the undistributed earnings if eventually remitted is not practicable

seasonality

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend 

 

inflation 

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations

items affecting comparability

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future

macroeconomic conditions 

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels and changes in interest rates the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business

compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition

commercial real estate markets in the united states have generally been marked by increased demand for space falling vacancies and higher rents since 2010 during this time healthy us property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals including higher occupancy rates and rents broad lowcost credit availability and increased institutional capital allocations to commercial real estate following years of strong growth us property sales volumes slowed in 2016 and 2017 but improved in 2018 as significant capital continues to target commercial real estate and the availability of relatively lowcost financing remains plentiful the market for commercial real estate leasing has also remained strong reflecting healthy economic and employment growth

european countries began to emerge from recession in 2013 with economic growth improving in 2017 and 2018 sales and leasing activity have also generally improved across most of europe in the past three years while leasing demand has remained solid sales market volumes were relatively flat in 2018 since the united kingdom’s june 2016 referendum to leave the european union eu economic and property market performance has been solid with lease volumes up in 2018 while investment volumes declined slightly however the continued absence of any legislation confirming the terms on which the uk will leave the eu as the march 2019 deadline draws closer has contributed to increased uncertainty and could adversely affect lease and sales volumes in 2019 

in asia pacific real estate leasing and investment markets have been active since late 2016 while leasing activity continued to grow solidly in 2018 investment levels cooled in 2018 as investors became more cautious however asia pacific investors remain a significant source of real estate investment both in the region and across other parts of the world

 

real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate actively managed real estate equity strategies have been pressured by a shift in investor preferences from active to passive portfolio strategies and concerns about higher interest rates 

the performance of our global real estate services and real estate investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and job creation stable healthy global credit markets and continued positive business and investor sentiment

effects of acquisitions 

we historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world for example on september 1 2015 cbre inc our whollyowned subsidiary pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement with johnson controls inc jci acquired jci’s global workplace solutions jcigws business which we refer to as the gws acquisition the acquired jcigws business was a marketleading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world the purchase price was 1475 billion paid in cash plus adjustments totaling 465 million for working capital and other items we completed the gws acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our americas emea and asia pacific segments we merged the acquired jcigws business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line which adopted the “global workplace solutions” name 

additionally on june 12 2018 cbre jason acquisition llc merger sub our whollyowned subsidiary and facilitysource holdings llc facilitysource wp x finance lp and warburg pincus x partners lp collectively the stockholders entered into a stock purchase agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement as part of the merger agreement i we purchased from the stockholders all the outstanding shares of capital stock of fs wp holdco inc blocker corp which owned 1686013 class a units the blocker units and ii immediately following the acquisition of blocker corp merger sub merged with facilitysource with facilitysource continuing as the surviving company and our whollyowned subsidiary within our americas segment the facilitysource acquisition with the remaining blocker units not held by blocker corp canceled and converted into the right to receive cash consideration as set forth in the merger agreement the estimated net initial purchase price was approximately 2665 million with 2630 million paid in cash we financed the transaction with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility we completed the facilitysource acquisition to help us i build a techenabled supply chain capability for the occupier outsourcing industry and ii drive meaningfully differentiated outcomes for leading occupiers of real estate

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform or independent affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest during 2018 we acquired a retail leasing and property management firm in australia two firms in israel our former affiliate and a majority interest in a local facilities management provider a commercial real estate services provider in san antonio a provider of real estate and facilities consulting services to healthcare companies across the united states and the remaining 50 equity interest in our longstanding new england joint venture 

during 2017 we completed 11 infill acquisitions including two leading software as a service saas platforms – one that produces scalable interactive visualization technologies for commercial real estate and one that provides technology solutions for facilities management operations a healthcarefocused project manager in australia a fullservice brokerage and management boutique in south florida a technologyenabled national boutique commercial real estate finance and consulting firm in the united states a retail consultancy in france a majority interest in a torontobased investment management business specializing in private infrastructure and private equity investments a san franciscobased technologyfocused boutique real estate brokerage firm a project management and design engineering firm operating across the united states a washington dcbased retail brokerage operation and a leading technical engineering services provider in italy 

we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets in general however most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income as a result of transactionrelated expenditures these include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own

 

our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2018 we have accrued deferred consideration totaling 1363 million which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

international operations

we are monitoring the economic and political developments related to the united kingdom’s referendum to leave the european union and the potential impact on our businesses in the united kingdom and the rest of europe including in particular sales and leasing activity in the united kingdom as well as any associated currency volatility impact on our results of operations

as we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management or aum as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe in addition our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings

during the year ended december 31 2018 approximately 43 of our business was transacted in nonus dollar currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan czech koruna danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee israeli shekel japanese yen korean won mexican peso new zealand dollar polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies us dollars in thousands

 



 



 

 

although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results for example we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2018 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 41 million had the eurotous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2018 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 95 million these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into us dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations 

from time to time we have entered into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency the us dollar in march 2014 we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts including agreements to buy us dollars and sell australian dollars british pound sterling canadian dollars euros and japanese yen the purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated ebitda hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts as such changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as we made the decision to let our program expire at the end of 2016 included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report was a net gain of 77 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the year ended december 31 2016 we do not intend to hedge our foreign currency denominated ebitda in 2019

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 dollars in thousands  

 



 



fee revenue ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use these measures in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we generally use these nongaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of fee revenue ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

 

fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients we believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company’s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business 

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt income taxes depreciation and amortization amounts shown for adjusted ebitda further remove from ebitda the impact of certain cash and noncash items related to acquisitions costs associated with our reorganization including costsavings initiatives certain carried interest incentive compensation reversal to align with the timing of associated revenue and other nonrecurring costs we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments these measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments we also use adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows dollars in thousands

 



 







 

year ended december 31 2018 compared to year ended december 31 2017 

we reported consolidated net income of 11 billion for the year ended december 31 2018 on revenue of 213 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 6971 million on revenue of 186 billion for the year ended december 31 2017

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2018 increased by 27 billion or 146 as compared to the year ended december 30 2017 the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue up 152 and property management revenue up 71 increased leasing up 178 sales up 61 and commercial mortgage origination activity up 191 and higher revenue from our global investment management segment up 126 in addition foreign currency translation had an 885 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2018 primarily driven by strength in the british pound sterling and euro partially offset by weakness in the argentine peso and brazilian real

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 21 billion or 150 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business in addition our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense lastly foreign currency translation had a 650 million negative impact on total cost of services during the year ended december 31 2018 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 768 for the year ended december 31 2017 to 771 for the year ended december 31 2018 primarily driven by our revenue mix with occupier outsourcing revenue which has a lower margin than sales and lease revenue comprising a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior year 

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 5071 million or 177 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 the increase was mostly driven by higher payrollrelated costs including increases in bonus and stock compensation expense higher carried interest expense and increases in consulting marketing and occupancy costs during 2018 we also incurred 352 million of costs incurred in connection with our reorganization including costsavings initiatives and 89 million of costs as a result of a litigation settlement the impact of which was partly offset by lower integration and other costs associated with acquisitions foreign currency translation also had a 235 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2018 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 153 for the year ended december 31 2017 to 158 for the year ended december 31 2018 partially driven by higher bonus expense in our development services segment with no corresponding increase in revenue as bonus expense was attributable to an increase in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as due to the costs incurred in connection with our reorganization

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 459 million or 113 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 this increase was primarily attributable to a rise in depreciation expense of 259 million during the year ended december 31 2018 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures higher amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights and intangibles acquired in acquisitions also contributed to the increase

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 1145 million or 545 during the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment

our other income on a consolidated basis was 930 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 94 million for the same period in 2017 included in other income for the year ended december 31 2018 was a onetime gain of 1004 million associated with remeasuring our investment in a previously unconsolidated subsidiary in new england to fair value as of the date we acquired the remaining controlling interest 

 

our consolidated interest expense decreased by 295 million or 216 for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 this decrease was primarily driven by the early redemption in full of the 8000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 500 senior notes in the first quarter of 2018 

our writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was 280 million for the year ended december 31 2018 these costs included a 200 million premium paid and the writeoff of 80 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the early redemption in full of the 8000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 500 senior notes

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 3131 million for the year ended december 31 2018 as compared to 4678 million for the same period in 2017 our provision for income taxes for 2018 included a net expense trueup of 133 million resulting from completion of accounting for the tax act our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a net expense of 1434 million for the provisional charge related to the tax act these net expenses were primarily comprised of a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of a tax benefit from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower us corporate income tax rate and the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits that will decrease the liability related to the transition tax excluding these net charges associated with the tax act our effective tax rate after adjusting pretax income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests would have been 218 for the year ended december 31 2018 compared to 278 for the year ended december 31 2017 we benefited from a lower us corporate tax rate with such rate being 35 in 2017 versus 21 in 2018 the effect of the decrease in the us corporate tax rate was partially offset by discrete tax benefits for the year ended december 31 2017 from the remeasurement of income tax exposures relating to prior periods and release of valuation allowances on foreign income tax credits that were expected to be utilized with no similar items for the year ended december 31 2018

year ended december 31 2017 compared to year ended december 31 2016

we reported consolidated net income of 6971 million for the year ended december 31 2017 on revenue of 186 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 5731 million on revenue of 174 billion for the year ended december 31 2016

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2017 increased by 13 billion or 73 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue up 80 and property management revenue up 93 increased sales up 58 and leasing activity up 75 and higher loan servicing revenue up 289 these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a 347 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2017 primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling partially offset by strength in the euro

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 8842 million or 66 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to same period in 2016 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business as well as higher professional bonuses particularly in the united states and united kingdom in addition as previously mentioned our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a 379 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2017 in addition we incurred 371 million of costs in 2016 in connection with our costelimination project that did not recur in 2017 which partially contributed to cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreasing from 773 for the year ended december 31 2016 to 768 for the year ended december 31 2017

 

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 784 million or 28 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016  the increase was mostly driven by higher payrollrelated costs including increases in bonus and stock compensation expense driven by improved operating performance this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 967 million in integration and other costs related to the gws acquisition incurred during the year ended december 31 2017 as well as the impact of 414 million of costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2016 as part of our costelimination project which did not recur during the year ended december 31 2017 foreign currency also had a 17 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2017 including a 01 million positive impact from foreign currency translation and 16 million of favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended december 31 2016 part of which related to net hedging activity during 2016 which did not recur in the 2017 given that we discontinued our hedging program at the end of 2016 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 160 for the year ended december 31 2016 to 153 for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily driven by the aforementioned decline in integration and other costs related to the gws acquisition as well as the costs associated with our costelimination project in 2016 

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 392 million or 107 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights a rise in depreciation expense of 145 million during the year ended december 31 2017 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures also contributed to the increase

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 129 million or 65 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment

our consolidated interest expense decreased by 80 million or 55 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to lower net borrowings under our credit agreement and a decrease in notes payable on real estate during 2017

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 4678 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2969 million for the same period in 2016 our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a provisional net charge of 1434 million attributable to the tax act this net charge was primarily comprised of a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of a tax benefit from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower us corporate income tax rate and the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits that will decrease the liability related to the transition tax excluding this net charge our effective tax rate for 2017 after adjusting pretax income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests would have been 278 compared to 341 for the year ended december 31 2016 we benefited from a more favorable geographic mix of income the remeasurement of income tax exposures relating to prior periods and release of valuation allowances the release of valuation allowances during the year ended december 31 2017 primarily related to valuation allowances on foreign income tax credits that are expected to be utilized as well as on net operating losses that have been utilized through current year operations the remeasurement of income tax exposures primarily due to the resolution of certain tax audits during the year ended december 31 2017 contributed to the lower effective tax rate for 2017 as compared to 2016 in addition the contribution of income from lower taxed jurisdictions to our total consolidated income for the year ended december 31 2017 provided a more favorable geographic mix of income resulting in a decrease to the overall effective tax rate

liquidity and capital resources

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2019 include up to approximately 210 million of anticipated capital expenditures net of tenant concessions as of december 31 2018 we had aggregate commitments of 537 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 243 million of which is expected to be funded in 2019 additionally as of december 31 2018 we are committed to fund 347 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time as of december 31 2018 we had 28 billion of borrowings available under our 28 billion revolving credit facility

we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and general investment requirements including strategic infill acquisitions and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future and at a minimum for the next 12 months we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments as we have done in the past with new debt instruments at interest rates maturities and terms we deem attractive we may also from time to time in our sole discretion purchase redeem or retire our existing senior notes through tender offers in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise

in march 2018 we redeemed the 8000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 500 senior notes in full we funded this redemption with 5500 million of borrowings from our tranche a term loan facility and borrowings from our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement

 

as noted above we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions 

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are generally comprised of two elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all

the second longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2018 and 2017 we had accrued 1363 million 417 million of which was a current liability and 836 million 232 million of which was a current liability respectively of deferred purchase consideration which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report

in addition on october 27 2016 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of 2500 million of our class a common stock over three years as of december 31 2018 we have spent 1610 million to repurchase 3980656 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of 4043 during the month of january 2019 we spent 451 million to repurchase an additional 1144449 shares of our class a common stock with an average price paid per share of 3938 additionally on february 28 2019 our board of directors authorized a new program for the company to repurchase up to 3000 million of our class a common stock over three years effective march 11 2019 the existing program will terminate upon the effectiveness of the new program our stock repurchases have been funded with cash on hand the timing of future repurchases and the actual amounts repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions and other factors

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities totaled 5066 million for the year ended december 31 2018 a decrease of 1211 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2017 this decrease was primarily due to 11 billion of higher net borrowings from our senior term loans during the year ended december 31 2018 largely offset by the full redemption of the 8000 million aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 500 senior notes including 200 million premium as well as the 1610 million repurchase of our common stock during the year ended december 31 2018

net cash used in financing activities totaled 6277 million for the year ended december 31 2017 an increase of 4071 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the increase was primarily due to 4156 million of higher net repayments of senior term loans during the year ended december 31 2017

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes

exchange rates

our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional reporting currency which is us dollars see the discussion of international operations which is included in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “international operations” and is incorporated by reference herein

 

interest rates 

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt we enter into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates 

the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 7570 million at december 31 2018 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 4875 senior notes and 525 senior notes were 6164 million and 4437 million respectively at december 31 2018

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2018 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 56 million on pretax income and a decrease of 56 million in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2018

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting   

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

we also oversee a loan servicing portfolio which totaled approximately 141 billion in the americas approximately 174 billion globally at yearend 2017 

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissions which are payable upon completion of an assignment this mitigates the effect of compensation our largest expense on our operating margins during difficult market conditions we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity as well as greater investments in support resources including professional development and training market research and information technology branding and marketing than most other firms in our sector

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through cbre research and cbre econometric advisors our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups

competition

we compete across a variety of business lines within the commercial real estate industry including property management facilities management project and transaction management tenant and landlord leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and structured finance real estate investment management valuation loan servicing development services and proprietary research each business line is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2017 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets property types and services we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global national regional or local basis or within a market segment outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments and property ownersdevelopers that selfperform real estate services investment banking firms investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital and accountingconsulting firms that advise on real estate strategies some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as jll cushman  wakefield colliers international group inc savills plc and newmark group inc marketsegment specialists such as eastdil secured hff lp marcus  millichap inc and walker  dunlop inc and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business such as iss sodexo and abm

seasonality

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the 

 

fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend 

employees

at december 31 2017 excluding our independent affiliates we had more than 80000 employees worldwide approximately 37 of whose costs are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our occupier outsourcing and property management lines of business at december 31 2017 approximately 1900 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom work in properties we manage in california illinois new jersey and new york

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cbre” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cbre” and “trammell crow company” names we maintain trademark registrations for the cbre service mark in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business

environmental matters

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both the commercial 

 

real estate services industry in general and us environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our global investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines

risk factors 

tableend

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that later become material may also adversely affect our business

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity crises fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal or political uncertainty market volatility declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty for example the ongoing negotiations with respect to the terms of the united kingdom’s referendum to 

 

leave the european union and speculation about the terms and consequences of this exit or that of other european union members has caused and may continue to cause market volatility and currency fluctuations and adversely impact our clients’ confidence which may result in a deterioration in our uk and other european businesses as leasing and investing activity slow down 

adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in addition our development and investment strategy often entails making coinvestments alongside our investor clients during an economic downturn capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our capital markets business

the performance of our property management business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform this is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties rent collections may be affected by many factors including i real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally ii our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and iii the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed economic conditions  

in continental europe and asia pacific the economies in certain countries can be fragile which may adversely affect our financial performance

economic political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future as a result any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on thencurrent conditions and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition

our global investment management development services and capital markets including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made

our operations are subject to social political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2017 approximately 48 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan czech koruna danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee japanese yen korean won mexican peso polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in 

 

corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our global investment management business revenue and earnings over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for example the ongoing negotiations with respect to the united kingdom’s referendum to leave the european union or other changes to the membership or policies of the european union or speculation about such events may cause additional volatility in international currency markets in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors





















we maintain anticorruption and antimoneylaundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions embargoes and other importexport controls throughout the company but coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have penetrated and seek to continue to enter into emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there

 

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer while certain of our executive officers and key employees are subject to longterm compensatory arrangements from time to time which include retention incentives and various restrictive covenants there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all key members of our senior management we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business we and our competitors use equity incentives and signon and retention bonuses to help attract retain and incentivize key personnel as competition is significant for the services of such personnel the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel furthermore shareholder influence on our compensation practices including our ability to issue equity compensation may decrease our ability to offer attractive compensation to key personnel and make recruiting retaining and incentivizing such personnel more difficult if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer

we have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including property management facilities management project and transaction management tenant and landlord leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and structured finance real estate investment management valuation loan servicing development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2017 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future

a significant component of our growth over time has been generated by acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our 

 

thenexisting debt would increase acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company’s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology and accounting and management services

we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits including enhanced or more stable revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities cost synergies tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted income per share achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business financial condition and operating results

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could harm our business

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities in our global investment management as well as development services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flow

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2017 we had committed 386 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 319 million of which is expected to be funded during 2018 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets however our debt instruments contain restrictions that may limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our global investment management business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2017 we had eight real estate projects 

 

consolidated in our financial statements in addition at december 31 2017 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 70 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 1118 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 208 million as of december 31 2017 we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of 93 million 

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can be volatile period over period primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable

we have debt and related debt service obligations as of december 31 2017 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2017 our interest expense was approximately 1368 million

our debt instruments impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to











 





our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement of 200x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt as defined in the credit agreement less available cash as defined in the credit agreement to consolidated ebitda of 425x and in the case of the first four full fiscal quarters following the consummation of a qualified acquisition as defined in the credit agreement 475x as of the end of each fiscal quarter on this basis our coverage ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense was 1474x for the year ended december 31 2017 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to consolidated ebitda was 079x as of december 31 2017 our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us each of our material us subsidiaries which guarantees any of our other material indebtedness and certain of our foreign subsidiaries

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness in addition in the event of a creditratings downgrade our ability to borrow and the costs of that borrowing could be adversely affected 

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments in addition moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades of them may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings 

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business political economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations

we are subject to various litigation and regulatory risks and may face financial liabilities andor damage to our reputation as a result of litigation or regulatory proceedings 

our businesses are exposed to various litigation and regulatory risks in addition although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures accordingly an adverse result in a litigation against us or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations furthermore an adverse result in regulatory proceedings if applicable could result in fines or other liabilities or adversely impact our operations 

 

in addition we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients as a result allegations against us or the announcement of a regulatory investigation involving us irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation or investigation may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects 

we may be subject to actual or perceived conflicts of interest 

similar to other global services companies with different business lines and a broad client base we may be subject to potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of our services for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions in such situations our policies are designed to give full disclosure and transparency to all parties as well as implement appropriate barriers on informationsharing and other activities to ensure each party’s interests are protected however there can be no assurance that our policies will be successful in every case if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest there could be an adverse effect on our business or reputation regardless of whether any such claims have merit in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for certain parties where potential conflicts may exist there can be no assurance that potential conflicts of interest will not adversely affect us 

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market

our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients if we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform our ability to deliver highquality services may be materially impaired in addition we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays or fail to exploit new technologies then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted similarly our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business failure to successfully provide such tools and systems or ensure that employees have properly adopted them could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us 

security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs which could cause material harm to our business and financial results in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions a significant actual or potential theft loss corruption exposure fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients damage our reputation result in the loss of a competitive advantage impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting which could adversely affect our business revenues competitive position and investor confidence additionally we increasingly rely on thirdparty data storage providers including cloud storage solution providers resulting in less direct control over our data such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and 

 

compromised security systems for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation 

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or our infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyberattacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism employee errors or malfeasance or other events which are beyond our control in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel furthermore while we have certain business interruption insurance coverage and various contractual arrangements that can serve to mitigate costs damages and liabilities any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers business partners and other third parties we have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially adversely affected

the infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by numerous people daily as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm

our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations

 

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes we may incur significant financial penalties 

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec financial industry regulatory authority or finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability

we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental and employment laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations and us state wageandhour laws failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter

on december 22 2017 president trump signed into law the “tax cuts and jobs act” or tax act that significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended the tax act among other things reduces us corporate tax rates imposes significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest and net operating losses allows for expensing of certain capital expenditures puts into effect the migration from a “worldwide” system of taxation to a territorial system and imposes a deemed repatriation tax on certain earnings notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate tax rate the overall impact of the tax act is uncertain

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations which we expect will continue into the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects

 

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

we occupied the follo wing offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2017 

 



 

some of our offices house employees from our global investment management and development services segments as well as employees from our other business segments we have provided above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting our global investment management and development services offices

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases

we do not own any of these offices

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time and method to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time or over what period of time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k or this annual report

goodwill and other intangible assets

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present 

 

value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews 

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing see notes 2 and 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report

income taxes 

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2017 and 2016 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was signed into law making significant changes to the internal revenue code including but not limited to 







in december 2017 the securities and exchange commission sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 sab 118 “ income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act ” which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a net charge of 1434 million attributable to the tax act based upon our best estimate of the impact of the tax act in accordance with our understanding of the tax act and the related guidance available the changes included in the tax act are broad and complex the final transition impacts of the tax act may differ from the above estimate due to among other things changes in interpretations of the tax act any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax act any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax act or any updates or changes to estimates we have utilized to calculate the transition impacts including impacts from changes to currentyear earnings estimates and foreign exchange rates of foreign subsidiaries our accounting for the effects of the tax act is expected to be completed within the measurement period provided by sab 118

our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated 25 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability no additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax in connection with the enactment of the tax act or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings or as a result of a sale or liquidation of nonus subsidiaries these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds net of foreign tax credits determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable

seasonality

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend 

inflation

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations

 

items affecting comparability 

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report on form 10k you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future

macroeconomic conditions 

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels and changes in interest rates the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business

compensation is our largest expense and our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition

commercial real estate markets in the united states have generally been marked by increased demand for space falling vacancies and higher rents since 2010 during this time healthy us property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals including higher occupancy rates and rents broad lowcost credit availability and increased acceptance of commercial real estate as an institutional asset class following years of strong growth us property sales volumes slowed in 2016 and 2017 but the market has remained active with significant capital continuing to target commercial real estate commercial mortgage markets also have remained highly active driven by relatively low interest rates a favorable lending environment and improved market fundamentals the us government sponsored enterprises continue to be a significant source of debt capital for multifamily properties

european economies began to emerge from recession in 2013 with economic growth accelerating in 2017 sales and leasing activity has improved steadily across most of continental europe for more than three years and this trend gained momentum in 2017 since the united kingdom’s june 2016 referendum to leave the european union eu sentiment in that country has improved leading to higher property leasing and sales volumes however there continues to be uncertainty about both the withdrawal process and the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu

in asia pacific real estate leasing and investment markets have strengthened broadly since late 2016 in 2017 investment activity in particular was very strong and asia pacific investors continue to be a significant source of real estate investment both in the region and across other parts of the world

real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate actively managed real estate equity strategies have been pressured by a shift in investor preferences from active to passive portfolio strategies and concerns about potentially higher interest rates

the performance of our global real estate services and real estate investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and job creation stable healthy global credit markets and continued positive business and investor sentiment

 

effects of acquisitions 

we historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add and enhance service competencies around the world for example on september 1 2015 cbre inc our whollyowned subsidiary pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement with johnson controls inc jci acquired jci’s global workplace solutions jcigws business which we refer to as the gws acquisition the acquired jcigws business was a marketleading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world the purchase price was 1475 billion paid in cash plus adjustments totaling 465 million for working capital and other items we completed the gws acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our americas emea and asia pacific segments we merged the acquired jcigws business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line which adopted the “global workplace solutions” name

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform or independent affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest during 2017 we completed 11 infill acquisitions including two leading software as a service saas platforms – one that produces scalable interactive visualization technologies for commercial real estate and one that provides technology solutions for facilities management operations a healthcarefocused project manager in australia a fullservice brokerage and management boutique in south florida a technologyenabled national boutique commercial real estate finance and consulting firm in the united states a retail consultancy in france a majority interest in a torontobased investment management business specializing in private infrastructure and private equity investments a san franciscobased technologyfocused boutique real estate brokerage firm a project management and design engineering firm operating across the united states a washington dcbased retail brokerage operation and a leading technical engineering services provider in italy during 2016 we acquired our independent affiliate in norway a londonbased retail property advisor specializing in the luxury goods retail sector and a leading provider of retail project management shopping center development and tenant coordination services in the united states we also made an equity investment in a property services firm in malaysia acquiring a 49 interest 

we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets in general however most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income as a result of transactionrelated expenditures these include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own

our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2017 we have accrued deferred consideration totaling 836 million which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report

international operations

we are monitoring the economic and political developments related to the united kingdom’s referendum to leave the european union and the potential impact on our businesses in the united kingdom and the rest of europe including in particular sales and leasing activity in the united kingdom as well as any associated currency volatility impact on our results of operations

 

as we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management or aum as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe in addition our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound sterling fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

during the year ended december 31 2017 approximately 48 of our business was transacted in nonus dollar currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan czech koruna danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee japanese yen korean won mexican peso polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies us dollars in thousands

 



 

although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results for example we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2017 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 109 million had the eurotous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2017 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 120 million these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into us dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations

 

from time to time we have entered into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency the us dollar in march 2014 we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts including agreements to buy us dollars and sell australian dollars british pound sterling canadian dollars euros and japanese yen the purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated ebitda hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts as such changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as we made the decision to let our program expire at the end of 2016 included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of 77 million and 242 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015 respectively we do not intend to hedge our foreign currency denominated ebitda in 2018 

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

 

results of operations 

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2017 2016 and 2015 dollars in thousands  

 



 



fee revenue ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use these measures in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we generally use 

 

these nongaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of fee revenue ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients we believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company’s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt income taxes depreciation and amortization amounts shown for adjusted ebitda further remove from ebitda the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions costelimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation reversal expense to align with the timing of associated revenue we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments these measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments we also use adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows dollars in thousands

 



 



 



year ended december 31 2017 compared to year ended december 31 2016

we reported consolidated net income of 6915 million for the year ended december 31 2017 on revenue of 142 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 5720 million on revenue of 131 billion for the year ended december 31 2016

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2017 increased by 11 billion or 87 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue up 120 and property management revenue up 90 increased sales up 54 and leasing activity up 71 and higher loan servicing revenue up 289 these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a 345 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2017 primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling and venezuelan bolivar partially offset by strength in the euro

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 7695 million or 84 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to same period in 2016 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business as well as higher professional bonuses particularly in the united states and united kingdom in addition our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a 378 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2017 in addition we incurred 371 million of costs in the prior year in connection with our costelimination project that did not recur in the current year cost of services as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent at 696 for the year ended december 31 2017 versus 698 for the year ended december 31 2016 

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 774 million or 28 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to same period in 2016 the increase was mostly driven by higher payrollrelated costs including increases in bonus and stock compensation expense driven by improved operating performance this increase was partially offset by a decrease of 967 million in integration and other costs related to the gws acquisition incurred during the year ended december 31 2017 as well as the impact of 414 million of costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2016 as part of our costelimination project which did not recur during the year ended december 31 2017 foreign currency also had a 17 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2017 including a 01 million positive impact from foreign currency translation and 16 million of favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended december 31 2016 part of which related to net hedging activity during 2016 which did not recur in the current year given that we discontinued our hedging program at the end of 2016 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 213 for the year ended december 31 2016 to 201 for the year ended december 31 2017 primarily driven by the aforementioned decline in integration and other costs related to the gws acquisition as well as the costs associated with our costelimination project in 2016

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 392 million or 107 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights a rise in depreciation expense of 145 million during the year ended december 31 2017 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures also contributed to the increase

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 129 million or 65 during the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016 primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment

 

our consolidated interest expense decreased by 80 million or 55 for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to the year ended december 31 2016 this decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to lower net borrowings under our credit agreement and a decrease in notes payable on real estate during 2017 

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 4661 million for the year ended december 31 2017 as compared to 2967 million for the same period in 2016 our provision for income taxes for 2017 included a provisional net charge of 1434 million attributable to the tax act this net charge was primarily comprised of a transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings net of a tax benefit from the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities using the lower us corporate income tax rate and the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits that will decrease the liability related to the transition tax excluding this net charge our effective tax rate for 2017 after adjusting pretax income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests would have been 279 compared to 341 for the year ended december 31 2016 we benefited from a more favorable geographic mix of income the remeasurement of income tax exposures relating to prior periods and release of valuation allowances the release of valuation allowances during the year ended december 31 2017 primarily related to valuation allowances on foreign income tax credits that are expected to be utilized as well as on net operating losses that have been utilized through current year operations the remeasurement of income tax exposures primarily due to the resolution of certain tax audits during the year ended december 31 2017 contributed to the lower effective tax rate for 2017 as compared to 2016 in addition the contribution of income from lower taxed jurisdictions to our total consolidated income for the year ended december 31 2017 provided a more favorable geographic mix of income resulting in a decrease to the overall effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2017 the us corporate tax rate was 35 for 2018 the us corporate tax rate will decrease to 21

year ended december 31 2016 compared to year ended december 31 2015

we reported consolidated net income of 5720 million for the year ended december 31 2016 on revenue of 131 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 5471 million on revenue of 109 billion for the year ended december 31 2015

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2016 increased by 22 billion or 204 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 this increase was largely due to contributions from the gws acquisition which added 18 billion of revenue with a full year of activity reflected in 2016 versus only four months of activity in 2015 additionally the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue excluding the impact of the gws acquisition up 140 as well as increased leasing up 67 commercial mortgage origination up 180 loan servicing up 233 and sales up 14 activity these increases were partially offset by lower carried interest revenue in 2016 as well as foreign currency translation which had a 2778 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2016 versus the same period in 2015 primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 20 billion or 288 during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to same period in 2015 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business particularly due to the gws acquisition in addition as previously mentioned our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense we also incurred 189 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our costelimination project that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ended in the third quarter of 2016 to enhance margins and reduce our global cost structure going forward the expenses of which primarily consisted of severance costs related to headcount reductions and thirdparty contract termination costs these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a 2055 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2016 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 652 for the year ended december 31 2015 to 698 for the year ended december 31 2016 largely due to the gws acquisition excluding activity associated with the acquired jcigws business cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 625 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 640 for the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was partly driven by the aforementioned increase in costs incurred in connection with our costelimination project in 2016 and lower noncommissionable revenue in 2016 in addition outsourcing revenue excluding the impact of the gws acquisition which has a lower margin than sales and lease transaction revenue was a lower percentage of revenue in 2015 than in 2016

 

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 1477 million or 56 during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was mostly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payrollrelated costs particularly bonuses largely attributable to improved results most notably in our development services segment lastly we incurred an additional 191 million of costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our costelimination project these items were partly offset by lower carried interest expense as well as foreign currency which had a net 462 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2016 including 109 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year much of which related to hedging activities that was more than offset by a 571 million positive impact from foreign currency translation operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 243 for the year ended december 31 2015 to 213 for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to the gws acquisition excluding activity associated with the acquired jcigws business operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 257 for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 247 for the same period in 2016 partly driven by the lower carried interest expense during the year ended december 31 2016 

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 528 million or 168 during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the gws acquisition with a full year of amortization reflected during the year ended december 31 2016 versus only four months of amortization during the year ended december 31 2015 a rise in depreciation expense of 141 million during the year ended december 31 2016 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures also contributed to the increase

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 345 million or 212 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment

our consolidated interest expense increased by 260 million or 218 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 this increase was primarily driven by a full year of interest expense during the year ended december 31 2016 associated with our 6000 million of 4875 senior notes issued in august 2015 as well as higher interest expense associated with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement dated january 9 2015 2015 credit agreement due to an increase in interest rates

our writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was 27 million for the year ended december 31 2015 these costs included the writeoff of 17 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement dated march 28 2013 as amended 2013 credit agreement and 10 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 credit agreement

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 2967 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 3209 million for the same period in 2015 our effective tax rate after adjusting pretax income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased to 341 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 370 for the year ended december 31 2015 we experienced a favorable change in earnings mix in the current year with 60 of our earnings after removing the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests from the united states for 2016 versus 68 for 2015 in addition we realized certain discrete tax benefits during the year ended december 31 2016 that were not applicable in 2015 these items were offset in part by higher losses sustained during the year ended december 31 2016 in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be provided

liquidity and capital resources

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2018 include up to approximately 180 million of anticipated capital expenditures net of tenant concessions as of december 31 2017 we had aggregate commitments of 386 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 319 million of which is expected to be funded in 2018 additionally as of december 31 2017 we are committed to fund 208 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time as of december 31 2017 we had 28 billion of borrowings available under our 28 billion revolving credit facility

we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and general investment requirements including strategic infill acquisitions and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future and at a minimum for the next 12 months we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments as we have done in the past with new debt instruments at interest rates maturities and terms we deem attractive we may also from time to time in our sole discretion purchase redeem or retire our existing senior notes through tender offers in privately negotiated or open market transactions or otherwise

in february 2018 we gave the notice required under the indenture governing our 500 senior notes of our intent to redeem such notes in full on march 15 2018 we intend to fund this redemption with 5500 million of borrowings from our tranche a term loan facility and borrowings from our revolving credit facility under our credit agreement as well as with cash on hand

as noted above we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions

 

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are generally comprised of two elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

the second longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2017 and 2016 we had accrued 836 million 232 million of which was a current liability and 910 million 293 million of which was a current liability respectively of deferred purchase consideration which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report

in addition on october 27 2016 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of 250 million of our class a common stock over three years the timing of the repurchase and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of our common stock general market and economic conditions and other factors we intend to fund the repurchases if any with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2017 the authorization remained unused

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

tableend

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes

exchange rates

our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional reporting currency which is us dollars see the discussion of international operations which is included in item 7 “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “international operations” and is incorporated by reference herein

interest rates

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt we enter into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates see discussion of our interest rate swap agreements which is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “indebtednessinterest rate swap agreements” and is incorporated by reference herein

the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 1999 million at december 31 2017 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 500 senior notes 4875 senior notes and 525 senior notes were 8238 million 6457 million and 4680 million respectively at december 31 2017

as of december 31 2017 our outstanding gross variable rate debt was 2000 million and we had interest rate swap agreements in place for a like amount in order to hedge the variability of future interest payments due as such we have not utilized sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of a rise in interest rates on our variable rate debt as the impact would be minimal

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business lines within the commercial real estate industry including commercial property corporate facilities project and transaction management tenantoccupier and propertyagency leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination sales and servicing and structured finance real estate investment management valuation development services and proprietary research each business line is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2016 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets property types and services we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global national regional or local basis or within a market segment outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments and property ownersdevelopers that selfperform real estate services investment banking firms investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital and accountingconsulting firms that advise on real estate strategies some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do 

  

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than we are some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering among our 

  

primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as cushman  wakefield jll formerly jones lang lasalle incorporated colliers international group inc  savills plc and bgc partners which is the publicly traded parent of newmark grubb knight frank marketsegment specialists such as eastdil secured hff lp marcus  millichap inc and walker  dunlop inc and firms with business lines that compete with our occupier outsourcing business 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cbre” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cbre” and “trammell crow company” names we maintain trademark registrations for the cbre service mark in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow company” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and 

  

without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry in general and us environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our 

  

business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that later become material may also adversely affect our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity crises fiscal or political uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal or political uncertainty market volatility declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines 

  

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from asset services fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities our businesses could also suffer from political or economic disruptions that affect interest rates or liquidity or create financial market or regulatory uncertainty for example the uk’s vote to withdraw from the european union commonly known as “brexit” and speculation about the terms and consequences of this exit or that of other european union members has caused and may continue to cause market volatility and currency fluctuations and adversely impact our clients’ confidence which may result in a deterioration in our uk and other european businesses as leasing and investing activity slow down 

  

adverse economic conditions or political or regulatory uncertainty could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in addition our development and investment strategy often entails making coinvestments alongside our investor clients during an economic downturn capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our capital markets business 

  

the performance of our asset services line of business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform this is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties rent collections may be affected by many factors including i real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally ii our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and iii the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed economic conditions 

  

in continental europe and asia pacific the economies in certain countries can be fragile which may adversely affect our financial performance 

  

economic political and regulatory uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future as a result any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on thencurrent conditions and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate 

  

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including property sales and mortgage and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

our operations are subject to social political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2016 approximately 47 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee japanese yen mexican peso polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our global investment management business revenue and earnings over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results for example brexit caused a significant decline in the value of the british pound sterling against the us dollar during 2016 and negotiations with respect to the terms of the uk’s withdrawal or other changes to the membership or policies of the european union or speculation about such events may cause additional volatility in international currency markets in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we maintain anticorruption and antimoneylaundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions embargoes and other importexport controls throughout the company but coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in select markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have penetrated and seek to continue to enter into emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer mr sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business we and our competitors use equity incentives and signon and retention bonuses to help attract retain and incentivize key personnel as competition is significant for the services of such personnel the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel furthermore shareholder influence on our compensation practices including our ability to issue equity compensation may decrease our ability to offer attractive compensation to key personnel and make recruiting retaining and incentivizing such personnel more difficult if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

we have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including commercial property corporate facilities project and transaction management tenantoccupier and propertyagency leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage brokerage loan origination and servicing real estate investment management valuation development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2016 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated to that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth over time has been generated by acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

  

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company’s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology and accounting and management services 

  

we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits including enhanced or more stable revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities cost synergies tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted income per share achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could 

  

result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business financial condition and operating results 

  

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage asset services or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities in our global investment management as well as development services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2016 we had committed 316 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 255 million of which is expected to be funded during 2017 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets however our debt instruments contain restrictions that may limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our global investment management business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2016 we had nine real estate projects consolidated in our financial statements in addition at december 31 2016 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 60 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 1219 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 230 million as of december 31 2016 we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of 157 million 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

  

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can be volatile period over period primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

we have debt and related debt service obligations as of december 31 2016 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 26 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 our interest expense was approximately 1449 million 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to total interest expense of 200x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 425x as of the end of each fiscal quarter our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 1273x for the year ended december 31 2016 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 118x as of december 31 2016 our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness in addition in the event of a creditratings downgrade our ability to borrow and the costs of that borrowing could be adversely affected 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments in addition moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades of them may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which could cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this variance among periods makes it difficult to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis in addition as a result of the seasonal nature of our business political economic or other unforeseen disruptions occurring in the fourth quarter that impact our ability to close large transactions may have a disproportionate effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are subject to various litigation risks and may face financial liabilities andor damage to our reputation as a result of litigation 

  

our businesses are exposed to various litigation risks in addition although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures accordingly an adverse result in a litigation against us or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients as a result allegations against us irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects 

  

a failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses 

  

our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions we have adopted various policies controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

  

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market 

  

our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients if we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform our ability to deliver highquality services may be materially impaired in addition we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays or fail to exploit new technologies then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted similarly our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business failure to successfully provide such tools and systems or ensure that employees have properly adopted them could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes 

  

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us 

  

security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs which could cause material harm to our business and financial results in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions a significant actual or potential theft loss corruption exposure fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients damage our reputation result in the loss of a competitive advantage impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting which could adversely affect our business revenues competitive position and investor confidence additionally we increasingly rely on thirdparty data storage 

  

providers including cloud storage solution providers resulting in less direct control over our data such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation 

  

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results 

  

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyberattacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism employee errors or malfeasance or other events which are beyond our control in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel furthermore any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers business partners and other third parties we have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

the infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by numerous people daily as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm 

  

our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of asset services and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

  

we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental and employment laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations and us state wageandhour laws failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter 

  

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations which we expect will continue into the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in 

  

our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2016 

  

   

some of our offices house employees from our global investment management and development services segments as well as employees from our other business segments we have provided above office totals by geographic region rather than by business segment in order to avoid double counting our global investment management and development services offices 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases 

  

we do not own any of these offices 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business we believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefor as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue four basic criteria must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time and method to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time or over what period of time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k or this annual report 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectability our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing see notes 2 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary 

  

differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2016 and 2015 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

  

our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated 19 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings or as a result of a sale or liquidation of nonus subsidiaries these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds net of foreign tax credits determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable cash and cash equivalents owned by nonus subsidiaries totaled 4089 million at december 31 2016 

  

see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

see new accounting pronouncements section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year revenue earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to yearend 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

items affecting comparability 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this annual report on form 10k you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels and changes in interest rates the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business 

  

compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition 

  

commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past several years along with the steady improvement in global economic activity most particularly in the united states since 2010 us leasing markets have been marked by increased demand for space falling vacancies and higher rents during this time healthy us property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals lowcost credit availability and increased global and domestic capital flows property sales volumes slowed in 2016 following several years of strong growth however the market remained active commercial mortgage services activity rose in 2016 driven by lower interest rates and a favorable lending environment lending for multifamily properties in the united states was particularly robust reflecting strong activity with us government sponsored enterprises gses as well as a longterm trend of increased renting versus home ownership in the united states 

  

european economies began to emerge from recession in 2013 with most countries returning to positive albeit modest economic growth sales and leasing activity in europe has improved across most of europe for much of the past two years an exception is london where uncertainty in advance of and following the united kingdom’s referendum to leave the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” constrained occupier and investor activity in 2016 

  

in asia pacific the performance of real estate leasing and investment markets has varied from country to country amid slowing economic growth leasing and investment market activity was generally soft for much of 2016 but picked up noticeably in the fourth quarter however local capital from the asiapacific region continues to migrate to other parts of the world 

  

real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate real estate equity securities markets weakened in the fourth quarter of 2016 amid concerns about potentially higher interest rates 

  

the performance of our global real estate services and real estate investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and job creation stable healthy global credit markets and continued positive business and investor sentiment 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

we historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around 

  

the world on september 1 2015 cbre inc our whollyowned subsidiary pursuant to a stock and asset purchase agreement with johnson controls inc jci acquired jci’s global workplace solutions jcigws business which we refer to as the gws acquisition the acquired jcigws business was a marketleading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and had significant operations around the world the purchase price was 1475 billion paid in cash plus adjustments totaling 465 million for working capital and other items we completed the gws acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our americas emea and asia pacific segments we merged the acquired jcigws business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line and the new combined business adopted the “global workplace solutions” name 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform or independent affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest in early 2017 we acquired a leading software as a service saas platform that produces scalable interactive visualization technologies for commercial real estate and a national boutique commercial real estate finance and consulting firm in the united states during 2016 we acquired our independent affiliate in norway a londonbased retail property advisor specializing in the luxury goods retail sector and a leading provider of retail project management shopping center development and tenant coordination services in the united states we also made an equity investment in a property services firm in malaysia acquiring a 49 interest during 2015 we completed eight infill acquisitions including a seattlebased leader in capital markets services for affordable housing a texasbased commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services an energy management specialist based in brookfield wisconsin a chicagobased location data analytics firm one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the midwestern united states an advisory consulting and research firm specializing in the canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in columbia south carolina and memphis tennessee 

  

we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets in general however most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income as a result of transactionrelated expenditures these include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own 

  

our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2016 we have accrued deferred consideration totaling 910 million which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

international operations 

  

we are monitoring the economic and political developments related to brexit and the potential impact on our businesses in the united kingdom and the rest of europe including in particular sales and leasing activity in the united kingdom as well as any associated currency volatility impact on our results of operations 

  

as we continue to increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management or aum as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe in addition our global workplace solutions business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound sterling which has significantly declined in value as compared to the us dollar and other currencies as a 

  

result of brexit fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

  

during the year ended december 31 2016 approximately 47 of our business was transacted in nonus dollar currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan danish krone euro hong kong dollar indian rupee japanese yen mexican peso polish zloty singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc and thai baht the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies us dollars in thousands 

  

   

although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results for example we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2016 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 49 million had the eurotous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2016 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 37 million these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into us dollars and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations 

  

we enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency the us dollar in march 2014 we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program which expired in december 2016 by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts including agreements to buy us dollars and sell australian dollars british pound sterling canadian dollars euros and japanese yen the purpose of these forward contracts was to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated ebitda hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts as such changes in the fair values of these contracts were recorded directly in earnings included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of 77 million  242 million and 53 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 respectively as of december 31 2016 we had no foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding as the program has been terminated we do not intend to hedge our foreign currency denominated ebitda in 2017 

  

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2016 2015 and 2014 dollars in thousands 

  

   

fee revenue ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap when analyzing our operating performance investors should use these measures in addition to and not as an alternative for their most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we 

  

generally use these nongaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes we believe these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of fee revenue ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

  

fee revenue is gross revenue less both client reimbursed costs largely associated with employees that are dedicated to client facilities and subcontracted vendor work performed for clients we believe that investors may find this measure useful to analyze the company’s overall financial performance because it excludes costs reimbursable by clients and as such provides greater visibility into the underlying performance of our business 

  

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt income taxes depreciation and amortization amounts shown for adjusted ebitda further remove from ebitda the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions costelimination expenses and certain carried interest incentive compensation reversal expense to align with the timing of associated revenue we believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending 

  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments these measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments we also use adjusted ebitda as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs 

  

ebitda and adjusted ebitda are calculated as follows dollars in thousands 

  

  

   

   

year ended december 31 2016 compared to year ended december 31 2015 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 5720 million for the year ended december 31 2016 on revenue of 131 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 5471 million on revenue of 109 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2016 increased by 22 billion or 204 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 this increase was largely due to contributions from the gws acquisition which added 18 billion of revenue with a full year of activity reflected in the current year versus only four months of activity in 2015 additionally the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue excluding the impact of the gws acquisition up 140 as well as increased leasing up 67 commercial mortgage brokerage up 191 and sales up 14 activity these increases were partially offset by lower carried interest revenue in the current year as well as foreign currency translation which had a 2778 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2016 versus the same period in 2015 primarily driven by weakness in the british pound sterling 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 20 billion or 288 during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to same period in 2015 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing business particularly due to the gws acquisition in addition our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense we also incurred 189 million of additional costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our costelimination project that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 and ended in the third quarter of 2016 to enhance margins and reduce our global cost structure going forward the expenses of which primarily consisted of severance costs related to headcount reductions and thirdparty contract termination costs these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a 2055 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2016 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 652 for the year ended december 31 2015 to 698 for the year ended december 31 2016 largely due to the gws acquisition excluding activity associated with the acquired jcigws business cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 625 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 640 for the year ended december 31 2016 this increase was partly driven by the aforementioned increase in costs incurred in connection with our costelimination project in 2016 and lower noncommissionable revenue in the current year in addition outsourcing revenue excluding the impact of the gws acquisition which has a lower margin than sales and lease transaction revenue was a lower percentage of revenue in 2015 than in 2016 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 1477 million or 56 during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the increase was mostly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payrollrelated costs particularly bonuses largely attributable to improved results most notably in our development services segment lastly we incurred an additional 191 million of costs in 2016 versus 2015 in connection with our costelimination project these items were partly offset by lower carried interest expense as well as foreign currency which had a net 462 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2016 including 109 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year much of which related to hedging activities that was more than offset by a 571 million positive impact from foreign currency translation operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 

  

decreased from 243 for the year ended december 31 2015 to 213 for the year ended december 31 2016 primarily due to the gws acquisition excluding activity associated with the acquired jcigws business operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 257 for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 247 for the same period in 2016 partly driven by the lower carried interest expense in the current year 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 528 million or 168 during the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the gws acquisition with a full year of amortization reflected in the current year versus only four months of amortization in 2015 a rise in depreciation expense during the year ended december 31 2016 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures also contributed to the increase 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 345 million or 212 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our development services segment 

  

our consolidated interest expense increased by 260 million or 218 for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 this increase was primarily driven by interest expense in the current year associated with 6000 million of 4875 senior notes issued in august 2015 as well as higher interest expense associated with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement dated january 9 2015 2015 credit agreement due to an increase in interest rates 

  

our writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt on a consolidated basis was 27 million for the year ended december 31 2015 these costs included the writeoff of 17 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement dated march 28 2013 as amended 2013 credit agreement and 10 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 credit agreement 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 2967 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to 3209 million for the same period in 2015 our effective tax rate after adjusting pretax income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased to 341 for the year ended december 31 2016 compared to 370 for the year ended december 31 2015 we experienced a favorable change in earnings mix in the current year with 60 of our earnings after removing the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests from the united states for 2016 versus 68 for 2015 in addition we realized certain discrete tax benefits in the current year that were not applicable in 2015 these items were offset in part by higher losses sustained in the current year in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be provided 

  

year ended december 31 2015 compared to year ended december 31 2014 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 5471 million for the year ended december 31 2015 on revenue of 109 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 4845 million on revenue of 90 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2015 increased by 18 billion or 200 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was in part due to contributions from the gws acquisition from september 1 2015 through december 31 2015 additionally the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher occupier outsourcing revenue excluding the impact of the gws acquisition up 154 and property management fees up 175 as well as increased sales up 179 and leasing up 115 activity an increase in global appraisal revenue up 186 and commercial mortgage brokerage activity in our americas segment up 285 also contributed to the positive variance foreign currency translation had a 5364 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen during the year ended december 31 2015 versus the year ended december 31 2014 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 15 billion or 262 during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our occupier outsourcing and property management businesses particularly due to the gws acquisition in addition as previously mentioned our sales professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in sales and lease transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission expense lastly we incurred 183 million of costs in connection with our costelimination project these increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation which had a 3184 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2015 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 620 for the year ended december 31 2014 to 652 for the year ended december 31 2015 largely due to the gws acquisition excluding activity associated with the acquired jcigws business cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 620 for the year ended december 31 2014 compared to 625 for the year ended december 31 2015 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 1946 million or 80 during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the increase was partly driven by costs associated with the gws acquisition also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payrollrelated costs including bonuses attributable to increased headcount and improved results as well as higher consulting marketing and travel costs lastly we incurred 221 million of costs in connection with our costelimination project these increases were partially mitigated by an 86 million asset impairment charge incurred in our americas segment during the year ended december 31 2014 which did not recur during the year ended december 31 2015 and foreign currency movement foreign currency translation had a 1623 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2015 and there was an improvement of 207 million in foreign currency transaction activity over the year ended december 31 2014 much of which related to hedging activities operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 270 for the year ended december 31 2014 to 243 for the year ended december 31 2015 partially due to the gws acquisition excluding activity associated with the acquired jcigws business operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 270 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to 257 for the year ended december 31 2015 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 490 million or 185 during the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the gws acquisition as well as increased amortization expense associated with mortgage servicing rights a rise in depreciation expense during the year ended december 31 2015 driven by technologyrelated capital expenditures also contributed to the increase 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was 108 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 577 million for the year ended december 31 2014 these gains resulted from activity within our global investment management and development services segments

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 3209 million for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 2638 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was driven by the significant growth in pretax income during the year ended december 31 2015 our effective tax rate after adjusting pretax income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests increased to 370 for the year ended december 31 2015 compared to 353 for the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was largely due to the reversal of accrued taxes interest and penalties related to settled positions which had a favorable impact on the 2014 effective tax rate and did not recur in 2015

development services 

  

revenue was relatively consistent at 656 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to 652 million for the year ended december 31 2014 

  

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 171 million or 170 for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses during the year ended december 31 2015 as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 

  

2017 include up to approximately 170 million of anticipated capital expenditures net of tenant concessions as of december 31 2016 we had aggregate commitments of 316 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 255 million of which is expected to be funded in 2017 additionally as of december 31 2016 we are committed to fund 230 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time as of december 31 2016 we had 28 billion of borrowings available under our 28 billion revolving credit facility 

  

we have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and general investment requirements including strategic infill acquisitions and have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future and at a minimum for the next 12 months we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments as we have done in the past with new debt instruments at interest rates maturities and terms we deem attractive 

  

as noted above we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are generally comprised of two elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2016 and 2015 we had accrued 910 million and 797 million respectively of deferred purchase consideration which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

in addition on october 27 2016 we announced that our board of directors had authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of 250 million of its shares of class a common stock over three years the timing of the repurchase and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including the market price of the company’s common stock general market and economic conditions and other factors we intend to fund the repurchases if any with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

  

historical cash flows

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 4503 million for the year ended december 31 2016 a decrease of 2016 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net payments to vendors and income taxes paid during the year ended december 31 2016 these items were partially offset by higher commissions paid during the year ended december 31 2015 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6519 million for the year ended december 31 2015 a decrease of 99 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher bonuses and commissions paid during the year ended december 31 2015 as well as an increase in real estate held for development during the year ended december 31 2015 these items were partially offset by lower net payments to vendors and lower income taxes paid during the year ended december 31 2015 as well as improved collections of receivables and operating performance during the year ended december 31 2015 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 74 million for the year ended december 31 2016 a decrease of 16 billion as compared to the year ended december 31 2015 this variance was primarily driven by a greater amount invested in acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2015 particularly the gws acquisition

net cash used in financing activities totaled 1996 million for the year ended december 31 2016 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 7895 million for the year ended december 31 2015 this variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of 6000 million of 4875 senior notes in august 2015 as well as 3788 million of higher net borrowings of term loans under our 2015 credit agreement during the year ended december 31 2015 these collective borrowings during the year ended december 31 2015 as well as cash on hand were used to fund the gws acquisition which closed on september 1 2015 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 7895 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2321 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of 6000 million of 4875 senior notes in august 2015 and lower net repayments under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2015 also contributing to the increase was the establishment of 9000 million of new senior term loan facilities under our 2015 credit agreement partially offset by repayment of 6456 million of senior term loans under our 2013 credit agreement both of which occurred during the year ended december 31 2015 the net proceeds from the issuance of 525 senior notes and the redemption of 3500 million of 6625 senior notes during the year ended december 31 2014 partially reduced the overall cash used in financing activities during 2014

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

  

exchange rates 

  

our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional reporting currency which is us dollars see the discussion of international operations which is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “international operations” and is incorporated by reference herein 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt we enter into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates see discussion of our interest rate swap agreements which is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “indebtednessinterest rate swap agreements” and is incorporated by reference herein 

  

the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 7514 million at december 31 2016 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 500 senior notes 4875 senior notes and 525 senior notes were 8276 million 6070 million and 4393 million respectively at december 31 2016 

  

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2016 excluding notes payable on real estate the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 35 million on pretax income and a decrease of 35 million in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2016

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including commercial property corporate facilities project and transaction management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination sales and servicing capital markets structured finance solutions development services and proprietary research each business discipline is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2015 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets property types and services we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global national regional or local basis or within a market segment outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments and property ownersdevelopers that selfperform real estate services investment banking firms investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital and accountingconsulting firms that advise on real estate strategies some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do 

  

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than us some of them are larger on a regional or local basis or have a stronger position in a specific market segment or service offering among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as cushman  wakefield which is the name adopted following the combination of dtz and cushman  wakefield jones lang lasalle incorporated colliers international group inc which was spun off from firstservice corporation in 2015 savills plc which acquired usbased service provider studley inc in 2014 and bgc partners which is the publicly traded

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend

in addition to trade names we have developed proprietary technologies for the provision of complex services and analysis through our global outsourcing business and for preparing and developing valuation reports for our clients through our valuation business we also offer proprietary research to clients through our cbreea research unit and we offer proprietary investment analysis and structures through cbre global investors we have not generally registered these items of intellectual property in any jurisdiction while we may seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and 

  

without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry and us in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks 

  

and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that later become material may also adversely affect our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity crises fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines 

  

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the markets where we principally operate which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from asset services fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities our businesses could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that affects interest rates or liquidity 

  

adverse economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development which in turn could reduce the commissions and fees that we earn in addition our development and investment strategy often entails making coinvestments alongside our investor clients during an economic downturn capital for our investment activities is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our capital markets business 

  

the performance of our asset services line of business depends upon how well the properties we manage perform this is because our fees are generally based on a percentage of rent collections from these properties rent collections may be affected by many factors including i real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally ii our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and iii the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed economic conditions 

  

certain geographies within the americas as well as certain industry sectors that we serve have been negatively affected by the recent weakened performance of the oil and gas industry which may in turn diminish the performance of our various businesses in those geographies as well as reduce the demand for our services by our clients in such areas or who are affected by that industry in continental europe the economic recovery is slow and fragile if recovery in certain european economies stalls our performance may be adversely affected in addition china’s deteriorating macroeconomic environment could adversely affect our operations in our asia pacific segment which may adversely affect our financial performance 

  

economic uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our financial performance into the future as a result any guidance or outlook that we provide on our performance is based on thencurrent conditions and there is a risk that such guidance may turn out to be inaccurate 

  

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including investment property sales and debt and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability 

  

as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses may be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

our operations are subject to social political and economic risks in foreign countries as well as foreign currency volatility 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2015 approximately 45 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan euro hong kong dollar indian rupee japanese yen mexican peso singapore dollar and swiss franc fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management for our global investment management business revenue and earnings over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we maintain anticorruption and antimoneylaundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions embargoes and other importexport controls throughout the company but coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have penetrated and seek to continue to enter into emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has been generated by acquisitions any future growth through acquisitions will depend in part upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

  

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company’s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels 

  

we complete acquisitions with the expectation that they will result in various benefits including enhanced or more stable revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities cost synergies tax benefits and accretion to our adjusted income per share achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions is subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated and whether we can successfully integrate the acquired business failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could in turn materially and adversely affect our overall business financial condition and operating results 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer mr sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business we and our competitors use equity incentives and signon and retention bonuses to help attract retain and incentivize key personnel as competition is significant for the services of such personnel the expense of such incentives and bonuses may increase and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel to the same extent that we have in the past any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage asset services or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities in our global investment management as well as development services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2015 we had committed 128 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 88 million of which is expected to be funded during 2016 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our global investment management business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances in further support of the coinvestment 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2015 we had 10 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 91 million in addition at december 31 2015 we were 

  

involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 60 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 1219 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 296 million as of december 31 2015 we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries with outstanding balances of 124 million 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

  

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can be volatile period over period primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

we have debt and related debt service obligations as of december 31 2015 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 27 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 our interest expense was approximately 1189 million 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to total interest expense of 200x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 425x as of the end of each fiscal quarter our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 1181x for the year ended december 31 2015 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 145x as of december 31 2015 our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings in addition a default under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness in addition in the event of a creditratings downgrade our ability to borrow and the costs of that borrowing could be adversely affected 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur and so we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to finance our operations and investments in addition moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades of them may affect our ability to borrow as well as the costs of our current and future borrowings 

  

we are subject to various litigation risks and may face financial liabilities andor damage to our reputation as a result of litigation 

  

our businesses are exposed to various litigation risks in addition although we maintain insurance coverage for most of this risk insurance coverage is unavailable at commercially reasonable pricing for certain types of exposures accordingly an adverse result in a litigation against us or a lawsuit that results in a substantial legal liability for us and particularly a lawsuit that is not insured could have a disproportionate and material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients as a result allegations against us irrespective of the ultimate outcome of that allegation may harm our professional reputation and as such materially damage our business and its prospects 

  

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market 

  

our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients if we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform our ability to deliver highquality services may be materially impaired in addition we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays or fail to exploit new technologies then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted similarly our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business failure to successfully provide such tools and systems or ensure that employees have properly adopted them could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes 

  

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us 

  

security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs which could cause material harm to our business and financial results in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions a significant actual or potential theft loss corruption exposure fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients damage our reputation result in the loss of a competitive advantage impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting which could adversely affect our business revenues competitive position and investor confidence additionally we increasingly rely on thirdparty data storage providers including cloud storage solution providers resulting in less direct control over our data such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation 

  

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results 

  

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyberattacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism employee errors or malfeasance or other events which are beyond our control in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel furthermore any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers business partners and other third parties we have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

the infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by numerous people daily as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm 

  

our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets structured finance and debt solutions development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2015 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings from time to time inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a 

  

local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price for example during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 981 million in our global investment management segment this noncash writeoff was related to a decrease in value of our openend funds primarily in europe a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

a failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses 

  

our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions we have adopted various policies controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

  

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us or make incorrect determinations in complex tax regimes we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of asset services and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures 

  

or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

  

we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental and employment laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations and us state wageandhour laws failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter 

  

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations which we expect will continue into the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2015 

  

   

some of our offices house employees of both our global investment management and development services segments as well as employees of our other business segments often the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices we have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our global investment management and development services offices to avoid double counting 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases 

  

we do not own any of these offices 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business we believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefor as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant but litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue four basic criteria must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies see the revenue recognition section within note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k this annual report 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectability our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general 

  

outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future asset impairment reviews 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment at least annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 981 million in our global investment management segment this noncash writeoff was related to a decrease in value of our openend funds primarily in europe 

  

for additional information on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing see notes 2 5 and 8 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary 

  

differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

in november 2015 the fasb issued accounting standards update or asu 201517 “income taxes topic 740 balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” asu 201517 this asu requires the offset of all deferred tax assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for each taxpaying jurisdiction within each taxpaying component the net deferred tax must be presented as a single noncurrent amount asu 201517 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 with early adoption permitted entities may elect to use either a prospective or retrospective transition method we elected to early adopt the provisions of asu 201517 during the fourth quarter of 2015 and balance sheet amounts as of december 31 2014 have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation as of december 31 2014 2059 million of current deferred tax assets were reclassified to long term deferred tax assets 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2015 and 2014 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material 

  

our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated 14 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings or as a result of a sale or liquidation of nonus subsidiaries these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds net of foreign tax credits determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable cash and cash equivalents owned by nonus subsidiaries totaled 3155 million at december 31 2015 in 2013 we repatriated 1962 million tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances on foreign tax credits of 145 million and 49 million were recorded in 2013 and 2014 respectively

items affecting comparability 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels and changes in interest rates the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining 

  

employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business 

  

compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission andor bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition 

  

commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past several years along with the steady improvement in global economic activity most particularly in the united states since 2010 increased us property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving market fundamentals lowcost credit availability and increased global and domestic capital flows during this time us leasing markets have been marked by increased demand for space falling vacancies and higher rents 

  

european economies began to emerge from recession in 2013 with most countries returning to positive albeit modest economic growth reflecting the macro environment leasing markets in most of europe were slow to recover but improved significantly in 2015 buoyed by lowcost credit and continued capital flows europe saw increased property sales activity in 2015 with higher volumes occurring across more markets particularly on the continent 

  

in asia pacific the performance of real estate leasing and investment markets has varied from country to country amid slowing economic growth strength in australia has generally compensated for slower activity elsewhere in the region in addition increasingly local capital has been migrating to other parts of the world 

  

real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows into commercial real estate however real estate equity securities markets were adversely affected in 2015 by investor concerns about rising interest rates 

  

the performance of our global sales leasing investment management and development services operations depends on sustained economic growth and strong job creation stable healthy global credit markets and continued positive business and investor sentiment 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

the company historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world on september 1 2015 cbre inc our whollyowned subsidiary closed on a stock and asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement with johnson controls inc jci to acquire jci’s global workplace solutions gws business which we refer to as the gws acquisition the acquired gws business is a marketleading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world the purchase price was 1475 billion paid in cash with adjustments for working capital and other items we completed the gws acquisition in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our americas emea and asia pacific segments we merged the acquired gws business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line and the new combined business adopted the “global workplace solutions” name 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been regional or 

  

specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or independent affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest during 2015 we completed eight infill acquisitions including a seattlebased leader in capital markets services for affordable housing a texasbased commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services an energy management specialist based in brookfield wisconsin a chicagobased location data analytics firm one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the midwestern united states an advisory consulting and research firm specializing in the canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in columbia south carolina and memphis tennessee during 2014 we completed 11 infill acquisitions including our former independent affiliate companies in thailand greenville south carolina louisville kentucky and oklahoma city and tulsa oklahoma a commercial real estate service provider in chicago a new yorkbased valuation and advisory business a technical real estate consulting firm based in germany a consulting and advisory firm in the us hotels sector a shopping center management leasing and consulting company in switzerland and project management companies in germany and australia 

  

although we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets in general most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income the adverse impact is a result of transactionrelated expenditures which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own in addition our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2015 we have accrued deferred consideration totaling 797 million which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

international operations 

  

as we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management or aum as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which has recently seen more pronounced and adverse movement in the value of the euro against the us dollar similarly the gws business also has a significant amount of its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies such as the british pound sterling and euro fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

  

during the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 45 of our business was transacted in nonus dollar currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan euro hong kong dollar indian rupee japanese yen mexican peso singapore dollar and swiss franc although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies dollars in thousands 

  

   

for example we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2015 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 75 million we estimate that had the eurotous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2015 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 63 million these hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into us dollars without giving effect to our hedging activities and do not include an estimate of the impact that a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations 

  

we enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency the us dollar in march 2014 we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into foreign currency exchange forward contracts including agreements to buy us dollars and sell australian dollars british pound sterling canadian dollars euros and japanese yen the purpose of these forward contracts is to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated ebitda hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts as such changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of 242 million and 53 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

  

we also routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with certain transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the ordinary course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses associated with these foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts has not been significant 

  

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations we routinely monitor these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first calendar quarter and highest in the fourth calendar quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2015 2014 and 2013 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs on extinguished debt income taxes depreciation and amortization amounts shown for ebitda as adjusted which we also refer to as “normalized ebitda” further remove from ebitda the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions as well as certain carried interest incentive compensation expense neither ebitda nor ebitda as adjusted is a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance investors should use them in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 

  

we generally use these nongaap financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes and we believe that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business we further believe that investors may find these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending ebitda and ebitda as adjusted may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance 

  

these measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments these measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments we also use ebitda as adjusted as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs 

  

ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are calculated as follows 

  

  

      

year ended december 31 2015 compared to year ended december 31 2014 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 5471 million for the year ended december 31 2015 on revenue of 109 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 4845 million on revenue of 90 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2015 increased by 18 billion or 200 as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 this increase was in part due to contributions from the gws acquisition since september 1 2015 additionally the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher worldwide property facilities and project management fees excluding the impact of the gws acquisition up 159 as well as increased sales up 179 and leasing up 115 activity an increase in global appraisal revenue up 186 and commercial mortgage brokerage activity in our americas segment up 285 also contributed to the positive variance foreign currency translation had a 5364 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2015 primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar euro and japanese yen during the year ended december 31 2015 versus the year ended december 31 2014

revenue decreased by 682 million or 127 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 primarily driven by reduced carried interest revenue lower asset management fees which reflect the sale of assets in 2013 to harvest gains for fund investors which generated the carried interest in 2013 lower fees on some aum in emea and our exiting the management of a private reit also contributed to the decline during the year ended december 31 2014 these reductions were partially offset by higher acquisition fees during the year ended december 31 2014 as well as foreign currency translation which had a 45 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2014 

  

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 216 million or 61 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to higher carried interest expense incurred in 2014 foreign currency translation also had a 27 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2014 these increases were partially offset by lower costs due to the sale of assets and internalization of the management of the private reit discussed above 

  

this business transitioned from gainharvesting in 2013 to capitaldeployment in 2014 total aum as of december 31 2014 rose to 906 billion a rollforward of our aum by product type for the year ended december 31 2014 is as follows dollars in billions 

  

   

we describe above how we calculate aum also as noted above our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers 

  

development services 

  

revenue increased by 119 million or 224 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 primarily due to higher development fees during the year ended december 31 2014 due to an increase in new projects started 

  

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 258 million or 354 for the year ended december 31 2014 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses due to significantly improved operating performance 

  

as of december 31 2014 development projects in process totaled 54 billion up 102 from yearend 2013 and the inventory of pipeline deals totaled 40 billion up 1667 from yearend 2013 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2016 include up to approximately 195 million of anticipated capital expenditures net of tenant concessions as of december 31 2015 we are committed to fund 296 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time additionally as of december 31 2015 we had aggregate commitments of 128 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 88 million of which is expected to be funded in 2016 

  

on september 1 2015 cbre inc our whollyowned subsidiary closed on a purchase agreement with jci to acquire the gws business of jci the acquired gws business is a marketleading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world the purchase price was 1475 billion payable in cash with adjustments for working capital and other items we financed the transaction with i a new issuance in august 2015 of 6000 million in aggregate principal amount of 4875 senior notes due march 1 2026 ii borrowings in september 2015 of 4000 million in aggregate principal amount of new tranche b1 and tranche b2 term loan facilities under our 2015 credit agreement iii borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility under our 2015 credit agreement and iv cash on hand 

  

we also completed financing transactions in march 2013 september 2014 and december 2014 in each instance we took advantage of market conditions to refinance our debt in addition in january 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a 5000 million tranche a term loan facility and a 26 billion revolving credit facility as noted above in september 2015 we added new tranche b1 and tranche b2 term loan facilities under this same credit agreement and borrowed an additional 4000 million we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future and at a minimum for the next 12 months we may again seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt instruments with new debt instruments at interest rates maturities and terms we deem attractive 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are generally comprised of two elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2015 and 2014 we had accrued 797 million and 1252 million respectively of deferred purchase consideration which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6519 million for the year ended december 31 2015 a decrease of 99 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher bonuses and commissions paid during the year ended december 31 2015 as well as an increase in real estate held for development during the year ended december 31 2015 these items were partially offset by lower net payments to vendors and lower income taxes paid during the year ended december 31 2015 as well as improved collections of receivables and operating performance in the current year 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6618 million for the year ended december 31 2014 a decrease of 833 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 this variance was primarily due to an increase in receivables during the year ended december 31 2014 and greater sales of real estate held for sale and under development during the year ended december 31 2013 in addition higher bonuses income taxes and commissions paid during the year ended december 31 2014 also contributed to the decrease these items were partially offset by an increase in bonus accruals and improved operating performance during the year ended december 31 2014 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2015 an increase of 15 billion as compared to the year ended december 31 2014 this variance was primarily driven by amounts paid for the acquisition of the global workplace solutions business during the year ended december 31 2015 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1516 million for the year ended december 31 2014 a decrease of 3134 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 this decrease was primarily driven by greater amounts paid for acquisitions during the year ended december 31 2013 including the norland acquisition and lower proceeds received from the sale of real estate held for investment during the year ended december 31 2014 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 7895 million for the year ended december 31 2015 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2321 million for the year ended december 31 2014 this variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of 6000 million of 4875 senior notes in august 2015 and lower net repayments under our revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2015 also contributing to the increase was the establishment of 9000 million of new senior term loan facilities under our 2015 credit agreement partially offset by repayment of 6456 million of senior term loans under our 2013 credit agreement both of which occurred during the year ended december 31 2015 the net proceeds from the issuance of 525 senior notes and the redemption of 3500 million of 6625 senior notes during the year ended december 31 2014 partially reduced the overall cash used in financing activities during 2014 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 2321 million for the year ended december 31 2014 a decrease of 6342 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 this variance was primarily due 

  

to our refinancing efforts during the year ended december 31 2013 including the net repayment of 9240 million of senior secured term loans and the redemption of 4500 million in aggregate principal amount of 11625 senior subordinated notes partially offset by the issuance of 8000 million of 500 senior notes proceeds from the issuance of the 525 senior notes due in 2025 during the year ended december 31 2014 and higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our development services segment and higher distributions to noncontrolling interests during the year ended december 31 2013 also contributed to the variance these items were partially offset by the redemption of 3500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes in 2014

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

  

exchange rates 

  

our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional reporting currency which is us dollars see discussion of international operations which is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “international operations” and is incorporated by reference herein 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt we enter into interest rate swap agreements to attempt to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates see discussion of our interest rate swap agreements which is included in item 7 “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” under the caption “indebtedness” and is incorporated by reference herein 

  

the estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately 8786 million at december 31 2015 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 500 senior notes 4875 senior notes and 525 senior notes were 8026 million 5988 million and 4304 million respectively at december 31 2015 

  

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase 100 basis points on our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2015 excluding notes payable on 

  

real estate the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 49 million on pretax income and a decrease of 49 million in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2015 

  

we also have 383 million of notes payable on real estate net of unamortized debt issuance costs as of december 31 2015 these notes have interest rates ranging from 274 to 100 with maturity dates extending through october 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase 100 basis points our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 02 million for the year ended december 31 2015 from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant 

  

we also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from gains andor losses associated with these loan commitments has not been significant

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets structured finance and debt solutions development services and proprietary research each business discipline is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2014 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographic markets property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers that compete with us on a global national regional or local basis or within a market segment outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments and property ownersdevelopers that selfperform real estate services investment banking firms investment managers and developers that compete with us to raise and place investment capital and accountingconsulting firms that advise on real estate strategies some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are substantially smaller than us some of them are larger on a local or regional basis or have a stronger position in a market segment or service offering in addition it is also possible that two or more of our competitors could combine to create a much larger and more formidable global competitor among our primary competitors are other large national and global firms such as cushman  wakefield jll also known as jones lang lasalle firstservice corporation the publicly traded parent of colliers international savills which acquired usbased service provider studley inc in 2014 and dtz which was acquired in 2014 by an investment consortium led by tpg capital and merged with cassidy turley a usbased realestate services firm forming a new competitor entity and newmark grubb knight frank marketsegment specialists such as hff and eastdil secured and large global firms with business lines that compete with our outsourcing business 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2014 excluding our independent affiliates we had more than 52000 employees worldwide approximately 43 of which represent costs that are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business at december 31 2014 1222 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business in california illinois new jersey and new york 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cbre” name as well as our prior “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cbre” “cb richard ellis” and “trammell crow” names with respect to the cbre and cb richard ellis names we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both the commercial real estate services industry and us in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial but that later become material may also adversely affect our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity crises fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities in one or more of the geographies or industry sectors that we or our clients serve 

  

some of the world’s large economies and financial institutions continue to be affected by ongoing global economic and financial issues with some continuing to face financial difficulty fiscal uncertainty pressure on 

  

asset prices liquidity problems and limited availability of credit made worse in certain areas by increased unemployment or limited economic growth it is uncertain how long these effects will last or whether economic and financial trends in those areas particularly in europe will worsen or improve the current economic situation may be exacerbated if additional negative geopolitical or economic developments natural disasters or other disruptions were to arise 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines 

  

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the principal markets where we operate which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities our capital markets business could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that affects interest rates or liquidity in addition we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our global investment management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated these economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development 

  

our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest coinvestments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets during an economic downturn investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties the performance of these properties may be affected by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control including i real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally ii our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and iii the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed conditions 

  

for example during 2008 and 2009 credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession these adverse macro conditions affected commercial real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations similar to other commercial real estate services firms our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009 and as a result our stock price declined significantly if the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate 

  

certain geographies within the americas as well as certain sectors of the constituency that we serve have been negatively affected by the recent weakened performance of the us oil and gas industry which may in turn diminish the performance of our various development investment leasing and other businesses in those geographies as well as reduce the demand for our services by our clients in such areas or who are affected by that industry in addition the economic situation in europe remains unstable arising from the various austerity policies and continuing credit restrictions if the nascent recovery in certain european economies does not gain traction or if conditions remain unstable or worsen our revenues may be adversely affected 

  

economic uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global political security and competitive landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenue and earnings into the future as a result any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook which we have given or might give may be overtaken by events or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenue and earnings at the time we give such guidance based on thencurrent conditions there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be or to have been incorrect 

  

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including investment property sales and debt and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2014 we generated approximately 44 of our revenue from operations outside the united states with the reim acquisitions the footprint of our global investment management business significantly expanded particularly in europe and asia and with the acquisition of norland our global corporate services business has expanded significantly in europe additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we maintain anticorruption and antimoney laundering compliance programs and programs designed to enable us to comply with applicable government economic sanctions embargoes and other importexport controls throughout the company but coordinating our activities to deal with the broad range of complex legal and regulatory environments in which we operate presents significant challenges we may not be successful in complying with regulations in all situations and violations may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed in addition we have penetrated and seek to continue to enter into emerging markets to further expand our global platform however we may not be successful in effectively evaluating and monitoring the key business operational legal and compliance risks specific to those markets the political and cultural risks present in emerging countries could also harm our ability to successfully execute our operations or manage our businesses there 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2014 approximately 44 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan euro indian rupee japanese yen and singapore dollar our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which continues to experience economic stagnation that may result in further deterioration in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management revenue and earnings 

  

over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

selectively our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts there can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed additionally economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which affect cash flow unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position and hedge counterparty credit risk 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not perform as expected and similar opportunities may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of norland in 2013 any future growth through acquisitions will be dependent in part upon the continued 

  

availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired may prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

  

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or clients or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business and the acquired company’s businesses as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels 

  

the anticipated benefits of the norland acquisition and other acquisitions we make may not be realized as we contemplated 

  

we completed the norland acquisition as well as other acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits including among others enhanced revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities and operating efficiencies we are also likely to have similar expectations for future acquisitions achieving the anticipated benefits of the norland acquisition and other acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer mr sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees including those acquired through acquisitions or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer competition for these personnel is significant and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business we use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize many of our key personnel any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investment select local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire interests in other joint ventures in the future under 

  

our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage property management or other operations pursuant to which we license to that operation our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for a royalty or economic participation in that operation’s revenue profits or transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments 

  

the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can be variable primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another 

  

the pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control the underlying market conditions decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another 

  

a substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage and if asset values deteriorate our asset management fees will decline as a result our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delays in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity we also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or return hurdles finally during periods of economic weakness recession or stagnation existing and prospective clients in our global investment management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes thereby inhibiting the ability of our global investment management business to raise new funds additionally investors with open commitments to provide additional investment capital could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments andor seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are obligated to pay to the extent that clients in our global investment management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed we could experience a decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business 

  

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities in our global investment management as well as development services businesses subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2014 we had committed 190 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 127 million of which is expected to be funded during 2015 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is an important part of our global investment management business which might suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the 

  

entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances in further support of the coinvestment 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2014 we had 16 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 83 million in addition at december 31 2014 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 60 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 1105 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 255 million we also guaranteed outstanding notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 101 million 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

  

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

  

our leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are leveraged and have debt service obligations as of december 31 2014 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 19 billion for the year ended december 31 2014 our interest expense was approximately 1120 million on january 9 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement which replaced our prior credit agreement the amended and restated credit agreement provides for a 26 billion revolving credit facility and a 5000 million tranche a term loan facility with the term facility fully drawn on the closing date of the new facility 

  

our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur 

  

additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase if we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement to accomondate further leverage our debt service obligations may be substantially increased 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

from time to time moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades thereof may affect our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our class a common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments 

  

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which if accomplished may adversely affect our stock price 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to total interest expense of 200x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 425x as of the end of each fiscal quarter our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required for example we experienced a decline in ebitda during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009 which negatively affected our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 1234x for the year ended december 31 2014 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 102x as of december 31 2014 we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt in addition such a breach under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under our other debt instruments including the notes under our indentures 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material domestic subsidiaries borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of the us subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain nonus subsidiaries in each case held by cbre services inc and the us guarantor subsidiaries in addition in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre capital markets may incur in connection with 

  

funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

if we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties it could adversely affect our business 

  

we could be adversely affected by the actions deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition as a result a client may fail to make payments when due become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any client bankruptcy or insolvency or the failure of any client to make payments when due could result in losses to our company a client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us additionally certain occupier outsourcing and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients if such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client 

  

the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty which may include cobrokers lenders insurance companies hedging counterparties service providers or other organizations with which we do business or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company 

  

if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets which are incorporated herein by reference was 929 million and 680 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity 

  

failure to maintain and execute information technology strategies and ensure that our employees adapt to changes in technology could materially and adversely affect our ability to remain competitive in the market 

  

our business relies heavily on information technology to deliver services that meet the needs of our clients if we are unable to effectively execute our information technology strategies or adopt new technologies and processes relevant to our service platform our ability to deliver highquality services may be materially impaired in addition we make significant investments in new systems and tools to achieve competitive advantages and efficiencies implementation of such investments in information technology could exceed estimated budgets and we may experience challenges that prevent new strategies or technologies from being realized according to anticipated schedules if we are unable to maintain current information technology and processes or encounter delays or fail to exploit new technologies then the execution of our business plans may be disrupted similarly our employees require effective tools and techniques to perform functions integral to our business failure to successfully provide such tools and systems or ensure that employees have properly adopted them could materially and adversely impact our ability to achieve positive business outcomes 

  

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information intellectual property and proprietary business information could significantly adversely affect us 

  

security breaches and other disruptions of our information and technology networks could compromise our information and intellectual property and expose us to liability reputational harm and significant remediation costs which could cause material harm to our business and financial results in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by third parties or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions a significant actual or potential theft loss corruption exposure fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable or proprietary business data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or intellectual property or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant remediation and other costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients damage our reputation result in the loss of a competitive advantage impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial data and cause a loss of confidence in our services and financial reporting which could adversely affect our business revenues competitive position and investor confidence additionally we increasingly rely on thirdparty data storage providers including cloud storage solution providers resulting in less direct control over our data such third parties are also vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems for which we may not be indemnified and which could materially adversely affect us and our reputation 

  

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to provide our services effectively which could damage our reputation and materially harm our operating results 

  

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be materially adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyberattacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism employee errors or malfeasance or other events which are beyond our control in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss corruption or exposure of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel furthermore any such event could result in substantial recovery and remediation costs and liability to customers business partners and other third parties we have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially adversely affected 

  

the infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by numerous people daily as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm 

  

our business relies heavily on the use of commercial real estate data a portion of this data is purchased or licensed from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients or an inadvertent exposure of proprietary data could damage our reputation and competitive position and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed if there was an economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2014 approximately 10 of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california economic downturns in the california commercial real estate market particularly in the local economies in los angeles orange and san diego counties could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations 

  

we have numerous local and global competitors across all of our business lines and the geographies that we serve and further industry consolidation could lead to significant future competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services and investment industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets structured finance and debt solutions development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2014 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources allocated to a particular geography property type or service or business line than we have allocated that geography property type service or business line in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other new competitors such as financial institutions although many of our existing competitors are local or regional firms that are smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are further subject to competition from large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours and it is possible that further industry consolidation could lead to much larger and more formidable competitors globally or in the particular geographies property types service or business lines that we serve there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings and such charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price for example during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 981 million in our global investment management segment this noncash writeoff was related to a decrease in value of our openend funds primarily in europe a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could adversely affect our results 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions across different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities in the jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter 

  

our estimate of tax related assets liabilities recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to the tax laws in various jurisdictions the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions taxable income projections and the benefits of various restructuring plans to the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities 

  

we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures there are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits although we have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage our failure to do so andor the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position 

  

we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities andor damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity 

  

as a licensed real estate broker our licensed employees and we are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions 

  

the advice and services we render in our financial and valuation advisory businesses the investment decisions we make in our global investment management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs differences between actual values and appraised values and a variety of other litigation claims including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment discretion control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients for example in our valuation and appraisal business if market dynamics lead to a reduction in the market value of properties we have previously appraised we may be subject to a higher risk of claims including conflicts of interest claims based on the circumstances of valuations previously issued our valuation and appraisal services involve transactions where the value of the transaction is much greater than the fees we generate as a result the consequences of errors that lead to damages might be disproportionately large in relation to the fees generated in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully 

  

to the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct investors may have remedies against us our investment programs or funds or our employees under federal securities laws and applicable state laws moreover we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed 

  

we maintain commercial insurance in amounts we believe are appropriate to mitigate litigation risk but in the event of a substantial loss our commercial insurance coverage andor selfinsurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms further the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance companies’ insolvency any of these events could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business as well as investors for our global investment management business as a result allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities whether or not valid may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our global investment management business and our other businesses in addition if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us which could materially impact our business 

  

a failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses 

  

our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions we have adopted various policies controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

  

if we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties 

  

our business depends in part on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property such as our service marks client lists and information business methods and research existing laws or the application of those laws of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and on copyright trademark and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients does not infringe on the rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims may harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services 

  

confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices such as laptop computers which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted 

  

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us including in our role as a real estate broker registered investment advisor mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us and our employees to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we and our employees fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

  

we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental and employment laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations and state wageandhour laws failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters 

  

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations which we expect will continue into the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in 

  

our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

some of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segments also contain employees of our other business segments often the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices we have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our global investment management and development services offices to avoid double counting 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases 

  

we do not own any of these offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are unlikely to be significant but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of that anticipated by management

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm based on 2014 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2014 excluding independent affiliates we operated in over 370 offices worldwide with more than 52000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cbre” brand name investment management services under the “cbre global investors” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenantoccupier and propertyagency leasing capital markets solutions property sales commercial mortgage origination and servicing and debtstructured finance real estate investment management valuation development services and proprietary research we generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and perproject basis and from commissions on transactions in 2014 we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the fortune most admired companies and we ranked seventh among all companies on the barron’s 500 which evaluates companies on growth and financial performance we have been the only commercial real estate services and investment firm included in the sp 500 since 2006 and in the fortune 500 since 2008 additionally the international association of outsourcing professionals iaop has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for nine consecutive years in 2014 the iaop ranked us as a top three service provider among all outsourcing companies globally and as the highest ranked commercial real estate services company for the fifth consecutive year 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of some of our business lines 

  

compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions are particularly severe we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved nevertheless adverse global and regional economic trends could be significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition 

  

commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past five years in step with the steady improvement in global economic activity most particularly in the united states since 2010 increased us property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving occupancy market conditions including lower vacancy rates 

  

and higher rents as well as the availability of lowcost credit and increased capital flows into commercial real estate us leasing markets have also recovered with falling vacancies higher rents and increased transaction activity 

  

european economies began to emerge from recession in 2013 with most countries there returning to positive albeit very modest economic growth reflecting the macro environment property sales have increased significantly over the past two years with higher volumes occurring across much of europe in 2014 leasing markets outside of the united kingdom have been slower to recover but did show some improvement in 2014 

  

in asia pacific leasing activity picked up in 2014 but strong construction activity limits future rent growth investment markets have generally been stronger than leasing markets and while investment levels have varied across the region some countries like australia and japan have been notably strong 

  

real estate investment management and property development activity has generally improved since 2010 as the real estate credit markets recovered and capital flows into commercial real estate have been strong 

  

the performance of our global sales leasing investment management and development services operations depends on sustained economic growth strong job creation stable healthy global credit markets and continued improved business and investor sentiment 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world in 2013 we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in europe within our emea segment with the acquisition of londonbased norland managed services ltd norland for approximately 474 million which figure includes approximately 40 million deferred purchase price paid in 2014 the norland acquisition norland is a premier provider of building technical engineering services that enables us to selfperform these services in europe and adds to our expertise in the highly specialized critical environments market 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been quality regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest during 2014 we completed 11 infill acquisitions including our former affiliate companies in thailand greenville south carolina louisville kentucky and oklahoma city and tulsa oklahoma a commercial real estate service provider in chicago a new yorkbased valuation and advisory business a technical real estate consulting firm based in germany a consulting and advisory firm in the us hotels sector a shopping center management leasing and consulting company in switzerland and project management companies in germany and australia during 2013 we completed ten infill acquisitions including a firm serving the london prime residential real estate market a regional commercial real estate services firm based in san francisco a retail real estate services firm in the us midatlantic region a facility consulting and project advisory firm based in virginia serving the healthcare industry and two property management specialist firms one in the czech republic and slovakia and one in belgium in january 2015 we acquired a texasbased commercial real estate firm specializing in retail services 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets in general most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own in addition our 

  

acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2014 we have accrued for deferred consideration totaling 1252 million which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

international operations 

  

as we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management or aum as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which has recently seen more pronounced and adverse movement in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

  

our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2014 foreign currency translation had a 535 million negative impact on our total revenue and a 495 million positive impact on our total cost of services and operating administrative and other expenses in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate some of our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of certain foreign currencies into us dollars 

  

during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 44 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan euro indian rupee japanese yen and singapore dollar although we operate globally we report our results in us dollars as a result the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results the following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies dollars in thousands 

  

   

we estimate that had the british pound sterlingtous dollar exchange rates been 10 higher during the year ended december 31 2014 the net impact would have been an increase in pretax income of 93 million this hypothetical calculation estimates the impact of translating results into us dollars and does not include an estimate of the impact a 10 change in the us dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations 

  

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

we are leveraged and have debt service obligations as of december 31 2014 our total debt – excluding our notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets inc or cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables – was approximately 19 billion 

  

our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place some constraints on the operation of our business although our management believes that longterm indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business including facilitating the acquisition of the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing group nv the reim acquisitions and the norland acquisition the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness 

  

for example during 2014 we completed three financing transactions and in january 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the 2014 transactions included the issuance in september 2014 and december 2014 of 3000 million and 1250 million respectively in aggregate principal amount of 525 senior notes due march 15 2025 and the redemption in october 2014 of all of the then outstanding 6625 senior notes aggregate principal amount of 3500 million during the year ended december 31 2014 in connection with these financing activities we incurred approximately 47 million of financing costs in addition we expensed 57 million of previouslydeferred financing costs as well as a 174 million early extinguishment premium 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue there are four basic criteria that must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord with the remaining portions of the lease commission earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent the existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

property and facilities management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements 

  

investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision with many of these investments our global investment management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees which are commonly referred to as carried interest this carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period in addition our global investment management segment also earns successbased transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision 

  

we earn development and incentive development fees in our development services segment development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straightline basis over the development period incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive 

  

development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is recognized to the extent that future performance contingencies have been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectability our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries we control the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

as required by the “ consolidations ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc or topic 810 we consolidate all vies in which we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the vie determining which reporting entity if any has a controlling financial interest in a vie is primarily a qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both 1 the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity the entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary 

  

we analyze any investments in vies to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance including but not limited to the ability to direct financing leasing construction and other operating decisions and activities in addition we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity 

  

we also have several coinvestments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential vies we continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to vies that are not consolidated we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

if an entity is not a vie our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

other investments 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt 

  

impairment evaluation 

  

under either the equity or cost method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value when testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments andor look to comparable activities in the marketplace management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach these assumptions include net asset values internal rates of return discount and capitalization rates interest rates and financing terms rental rates timing of leasing activity estimates of lease terms and related concessions etc when determining if impairment is otherthantemporary we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and nearterm prospects of each investment 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cbre services inc or cbre in 2001 the 2001 acquisition our acquisition of insignia financial group inc or insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition the trammell crow company acquisition in 2006 the reim acquisitions in 2011 and the norland acquisition in 2013 other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the reim acquisitions a trademark which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition and a trade name separately identified as a result of the reim acquisitions the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts and loan servicing rights which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year when we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1 2014 2013 and 2012 we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 981 million in our global investment management segment this noncash writeoff was related to a decrease 

  

in value of our openend funds primarily in europe during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 198 million in our emea segment related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the united kingdom see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2014 and 2013 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes 

  

our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated 13 billion of undistributed earnings for which we have not recorded a deferred tax liability although tax liabilities might result from dividends being paid out of these earnings or as a result of a sale or liquidation of nonus subsidiaries these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate them or to sell or liquidate any of our nonus subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds net of foreign tax credits determining our tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable cash and cash equivalents owned by nonus subsidiaries totaled 2874 million at december 31 2014 in 2012 and 2013 we repatriated 580 million and 1962 million respectively in anticipation of these repatriations tax benefits of 288 million were recorded in 2012 additional tax benefits associated with the release of valuation allowances of 145 million and 49 million were recorded in 2013 and 2014 respectively 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs income taxes depreciation and amortization while amounts shown for ebitda as adjusted remove the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions and cost containment expenses as well as certain carried interest incentive compensation reversal expense our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons 

  

unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs additionally we believe ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results of operations 

  

however ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not recognized measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda and ebitda as adjusted in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda and ebitda as adjusted also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda and ebitda as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows dollars in thousands

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2014 increased by 19 billion or 260 as compared to the year ended december 31 2013 this increase was in part due to contributions from the norland acquisition however the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth fueled by higher worldwide property facilities and project management fees excluding the impact of the norland acquisition up 158 increased sales up 197 and leasing up 162 activity foreign currency translation had a 535 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2014 primarily driven by weakness in the australian dollar brazilian real canadian dollar indian rupee and japanese yen partially offset by strength in the british pound sterling during the year ended december 31 2014 versus the year ended december 31 2013

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2015 include up to approximately 180 million of anticipated net capital expenditures as of december 31 2014 we had committed to fund 255 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time additionally as of december 31 2014 we had aggregate commitments of 190 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 127 million of which is expected to be funded in 2015 

  

in december 2013 we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in europe with the acquisition of norland for approximately 474 million which was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility we also completed three financing transactions in recent years these occurred in march 2013 september 2014 and december 2014 respectively where we took advantage of market conditions to refinance our debt in addition in january 2015 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement providing for a 500 million tranche a term loan facility in addition to a 26 billion revolving credit facility we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of extraordinary events we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months from time to time we may again seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt securities with new debt securities at interest rates maturities and terms we would deem attractive 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the united kingdom our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall during 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report was 929 million and 680 million at december 31 2014 and 2013 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 61 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2015 

  

the third longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions our acquisition structures often include deferred andor contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions as of december 31 2014 and 2013 we had accrued for 1252 million and 869 million respectively of deferred purchase consideration which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report

net cash used in financing activities totaled 8663 million for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 7656 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our refinancing efforts during the year ended december 31 2013 including the net repayment of 9240 million of senior secured term loans and the redemption of 4500 million of 11625 senior subordinated notes partially offset by the issuance of 8000 million of 500 senior notes in addition higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our development services segment and higher distributions to noncontrolling interests during the year ended december 31 2013 also contributed to the increase

we had guarantees totaling 138 million as of december 31 2014 excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet and operating leases the 138 million mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries which expire at varying dates through december 2018 as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements 

  

in addition as of december 31 2014 we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects these guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our development services business each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget however we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable 

  

general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees these contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 20 to 50 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2014 we had aggregate commitments of 190 million to fund future coinvestments 127 million of which is expected to be funded in 2015 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2014 we had committed to fund 255 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries which we may be required to fund at any time 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in may 2014 the fasb issued asu 201409 “ revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 ” this asu requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers the asu will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states or gaap when it becomes effective on january 1 2017 this asu permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method early adoption is not permitted we are evaluating the effect that asu 201409 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures we have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of this asu on our ongoing financial reporting 

  

in february 2015 the fasb issued asu 201502 “ consolidation topic 810 amendments to the consolidation analysis ” this asu provides consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships limited liability corporations and securitization structures this asu offers updated consolidation evaluation criteria and may require additional disclosure requirements asu 201502 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2016 we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or disclosure requirements of our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

  

exchange rates 

  

certain of our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates these fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and payments in terms of our functional currency during the year ended december 31 2014 approximately 44 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the australian dollar brazilian real british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese yuan euro indian rupee japanese yen and singapore dollar we enter into derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency the us dollar 

  

in march 2014 we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering into 38 foreign currency exchange forward contracts including agreements to buy us dollars and sell australian dollars canadian dollars japanese yen euros and british pound sterling covering an initial notional amount of 2097 million the purpose of these forward contracts is to attempt to mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated ebitda hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts as such changes in the fair values of these contracts are recorded directly in earnings included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of 53 million for the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from net gains on foreign currency exchange forward contracts as of december 31 2014 we had 52 foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding covering a notional amount of 3020 million as of december 31 2014 the fair value of forward contracts with two counterparties aggregated to a 05 million asset position which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report as of december 31 2014 the fair value of forward contracts with four counterparties aggregated to a 13 million liability position which was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

we also routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with certain transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans included in the consolidated statements of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of 43 million for the year ended december 31 2014 and net losses of 18 million for the year ended december 31 2013 resulting from net gainslosses on foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts as of december 31 2014 the fair value of such contracts with one counterparty aggregated to a 08 million asset position which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report as of december 31 2014 the fair value of forward contracts with one counterparty aggregated to a 01 million liability position which was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2014 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

  

      

in march 2011 we entered into five interest rate swap agreements all with effective dates in october 2011 and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with topic 815 the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities the total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is 4000 million with 2000 million expiring in october 2017 and 2000 million expiring in september 2019 there was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended december 31 2014 and 2013 as of december 31 2014 the fair value of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a 269 million liability and were included in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately 6451 million at december 31 2014 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 500 senior notes and 525 senior notes were 8180 million and 4397 million respectively at december 31 2014 

  

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 100 on our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2014 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 24 million on pretax income and a decrease of 24 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2014 

  

we also have 428 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2014 these notes have interest rates ranging from 241 to 100 with maturity dates extending through 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 100 our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 02 million for the year ended december 31 2014 from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant 

  

we also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale fasb asc topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives included in the consolidated statements of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were net gains of 24 million for the year ended december 31 2014 resulting from gains on these loan commitments as of december 31 2014 the fair value of such contracts with three counterparties aggregated to a 24 million asset position which was included in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from loan commitments for years prior to 2014 was not significant

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

property owners occupiers and investors continue to consolidate their needs with fewer service providers and are awarding their business to firms that have strong capabilities across major markets and service disciplines we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing and disproportionate share of the business being awarded as a result of these trends

the americas 

  

the americas is our largest reporting segment comprised of operations throughout the united states and canada as well as key markets in latin america our operations are largely whollyowned but also include independent affiliates which license the use of the “cbre” and “cb richard ellis” names in their local markets in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us and an agreement to crossrefer business between us and the affiliate

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms including professional development and training market research and information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tends to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2013 excluding our independent affiliates we had approximately 44000 employees worldwide approximately 40 of which represent costs that are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business at december 31 2013 946 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business in california illinois new jersey and new york we believe that relations with our employees are generally good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cbre” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cbre” “cb richard ellis” and “trammell crow” names with respect to the cbre and cb richard ellis names we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cbre and cb richard ellis related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that affect the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have enacted various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit their release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us that may have resulted from 

  

historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely affect the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity crises fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities 

  

many of the world’s largest economies and financial institutions continue to be affected by ongoing global economic and financial issues with some continuing to face financial difficulty fiscal uncertainty pressure on asset prices liquidity problems and limited availability of credit made worse in certain areas by increased unemployment or limited economic growth it is uncertain how long these effects will last or whether economic 

  

and financial trends in those areas particularly in europe will worsen or improve the current economic situation may be exacerbated if additional negative geopolitical or economic developments natural disasters or other disruptions were to arise 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines 

  

our business is significantly affected by generally prevailing economic conditions in the principal markets where we operate which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities our capital markets business could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that affects interest rates or liquidity in addition we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our global investment management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated these economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development 

  

our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest coinvestments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets during an economic downturn investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties the performance of these properties may be affected by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control including i real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally ii our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and iii the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed conditions 

  

for example during 2008 and 2009 credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession these adverse macro conditions affected commercial real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations similar to other commercial real estate services firms our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009 and as a result our stock price declined significantly if the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate 

  

most recently in the united states continued uncertainty over fiscal and tax policy has caused and may continue to cause our clients to delay or cancel commercial real estate transactions which may affect our revenues the economic situation in europe remains unstable arising from the various austerity policies and continuing credit restrictions if the nascent recovery in certain european economies does not gain traction or if conditions remain unstable or worsen our revenues may be adversely affected 

  

fiscal uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global political security and competitive landscape make it increasingly difficult for us 

  

to predict our revenue and earnings into the future as a result any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook which we have given or might give may be overtaken by events or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenue and earnings at the time we give such guidance based on thencurrent conditions there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be or to have been incorrect 

  

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including investment property sales and debt and structured financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

in 2008 and 2009 the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude this disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding in some cases these sources were eliminated while the credit market has improved since the second half of 2009 liquidity remains constrained this uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price for example during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 981 million in our global investment management segment this noncash writeoff was related to a decrease in value of our openend funds primarily in europe these funds have experienced a decline in assets under management as the business mix shifts toward separate accounts consistent with market movements following the extended financial crisis in europe which has resulted in project sales and planned liquidations of certain funds a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer mr sulentic and certain 

  

other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees including those acquired through acquisitions or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property and investment management personnel we use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize many of our key personnel any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2013 we generated approximately 39 of our revenue from operations outside the united states with the reim acquisitions the footprint of our global investment management business significantly expanded particularly in europe and asia and with the acquisition of norland our global corporate services business will expand significantly in europe additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we maintain anticorruption and antimoney laundering compliance programs throughout the company violations of our compliance programs may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully 

  

manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2013 approximately 39 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese yuan the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which continues to experience economic stagnation that may result in deterioration in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management revenue and earnings 

  

over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and the euro relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar and the euro may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed additionally economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which affect cash flow and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future or perform as expected 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including the reim acquisitions that we completed in the second half of 2011 and our acquisition of norland in 2013 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

  

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels 

  

the anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions norland acquisition and other acquisitions we make may not be realized as we contemplated 

  

we completed the reim acquisitions as well as other acquisitions such as the acquisition of norland with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits including among others enhanced revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions and other acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 

  

our revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments 

  

with the completion of the reim acquisitions our global investment management business significantly increased and became more globally diverse with the addition of the reim funds a substantial part of our fees are more recurring in nature however the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business are all somewhat variable primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another 

  

the pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control the underlying market conditions decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another 

  

a substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage and if asset values deteriorate our asset management fees will decline as a result our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delay in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity we also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or absolute return hurdles finally during periods of economic weakness recession or stagnation existing and prospective clients in our global investment management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes thereby inhibiting the ability of our global investment management business to raise new funds additionally investors with open commitments to provide additional investment could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments andor seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are obligated to pay to the extent that clients in our global investment management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed we could experience a decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business 

  

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves coinvesting our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2013 we had committed 94 million to fund future coinvestments 81 million of which is expected to be funded during 2014 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is a very important part of our global investment 

  

management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2013 we had approximately 15 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 28 million and 40 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us in addition to being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable in addition at december 31 2013 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 50 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 803 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 250 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 32 million excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can affect our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

  

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintaining our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to total interest expense of 200x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 425x our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required for example we experienced a decline in ebitda during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009 which negatively affected our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio however we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009 and as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business we were and continue to be well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 897x for the year ended december 31 2013 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 143x as of december 31 2013 we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt in addition such a breach under our credit agreement could trigger a cross default under our other debt instruments including the notes under our indentures 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain nonus subsidiaries in addition in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations our credit agreement currently provides for a 12 billion revolving credit facility a 5000 million tranche a term loan facility and a 2150 million tranche b term loan facility as of december 31 2013 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 20 billion for the year ended december 31 2013 our interest expense was approximately 1351 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase if we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement our debt service obligations may be substantially increased 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

from time to time moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades thereof may affect our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our class a common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments 

  

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which if accomplished may adversely affect our stock price 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of 

  

equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre capital markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

if we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties it could adversely affect our business 

  

we could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition as a result a client may fail to make payments when due become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any client bankruptcy or insolvency or the failure of any client to make payments when due could result in losses to our company a client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us additionally certain occupier outsourcing and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients if such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client 

  

the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty which may include cobrokers lenders insurance companies hedging counterparties service providers or other organizations with which we do business or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company 

  

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information could adversely affect us 

  

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information are critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions a significant actual or potential theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our services which could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position additionally we increasingly rely on thirdparty data storage providers including cloud storage solution providers resulting in less direct control over our data such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems which could adversely affect us and our reputation 

  

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could impair our ability to effectively provide our services which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 

  

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be adversely affected by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to 

  

damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses cyber attacks natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism or other events which are beyond our control in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel we have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 

  

the infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by numerous people daily as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm 

  

our business relies significantly on the use of commercial real estate data we produce much of this data internally but a significant portion is purchased from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor our clients could damage our reputation and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities andor damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions 

  

the advice and services we render in our financial and valuation advisory businesses the investment decisions we make in our global investment management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs differences between actual values and appraised values and a variety of other litigation claims including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment discretion control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients for example in our valuation and appraisal business if market dynamics lead to a reduction in the market value of properties we have previously appraised we may be subject to a higher risk of claims including conflicts of interest claims based on the circumstances of valuations previously issued our valuation and appraisal services involve transactions where the value of the transaction is much greater than the fees we generate as a result the consequences of errors that lead to damages might be disproportionately large in relation to the fees generated in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully 

  

to the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct investors may have remedies against us our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law moreover we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed 

  

although some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate in the event of a substantial loss our commercial insurance coverage andor selfinsurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims or such insurance may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms further the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency notwithstanding that we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highlyrated companies any of these events could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business as well as investors for our global investment management business as a result allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities whether or not valid may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our global investment management business and our other global businesses in addition if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us which could materially impact our business 

  

a failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses 

  

our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions we have adopted various policies controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

  

our joint venture activities and affiliate program involve unique risks that are often outside of our control and that if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future under our affiliate program we enter into contractual relationships with local brokerage property management or other operations pursuant to which we license our name and make available certain of our resources in exchange for economic participation in transactional activity in many of these joint ventures and affiliations we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or affiliates and other participants or operators of affiliates may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants and operators may become bankrupt or 

  

have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant or affiliate acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets structured finance and debt solutions development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2013 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services and business lines depending on the geography property type or service or business line we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers and investment firms including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service and investment competencies to ours it is also possible that two or more of our competitors could combine to create a much larger and more formidable global competitor in general there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed if there was an economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2013 approximately 10 of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california economic downturns in the california commercial real estate market similar to recent downturns experienced in california and particularly in the local economies in los angeles orange and san diego counties could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could adversely affect our results 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions that involve different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter 

  

our estimate of tax related assets liabilities recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to the tax laws in various jurisdictions the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions taxable income projections and the benefits of various restructuring plans to the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities 

  

we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures there are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits although we have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage our failure to do so andor the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position 

  

if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets which are incorporated herein by reference was 680 million and 635 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity 

  

if we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties 

  

our business depends in part on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property such as our service marks client lists and information business methods and research existing laws or the application of those laws of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and on copyright trademark and other intellectual property laws to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients does not infringe on the rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims may harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services 

  

confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices such as laptop computers which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted 

  

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us including in our role as a real estate broker registered investment advisor mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these 

  

activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

  

we are also subject to laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental and employment laws including the fair labor standards act occupational health and safety regulations and state wageandhour laws failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of significant fines by governmental authorities awards of damages to private litigants and significant amounts paid in legal fees or settlements of these matters 

  

as the size and scope of our business has increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing and other regulatory requirements and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations which we expect will continue into the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of regulatory compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

not applicable 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2013 

  

   

some of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segments also contain employees of our other business segments often the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices we have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our global investment management and development services offices to avoid double counting 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management

recent sales of unregistered securities 

  

on december 23 2013 we issued an aggregate of 362916 shares of nonvested class a common stock to certain members of senior management of norland managed services ltd norland in connection with our acquisition of norland these shares may not be directly or indirectly transferred until december 2018 and are subject to forfeiture if the holder thereof terminates employment with us prior to such date with certain exceptions these securities qualified for exemption under section 42 of the securities act of 1933 or the securities act since the issuance of securities by us did not involve a public offering the offering was not a “public offering” as defined in section 42 due to the number of persons involved in the transaction size of the offering manner of the offering and number of securities offered in addition these shareholders had the necessary investment intent as required by section 42 since they agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend stating that such securities are restricted pursuant to rule 144 of the securities act this restriction ensures that these securities would not be immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a “public offering” based on an analysis of the above factors we have met the requirements to qualify for exemption under section 42 of the securities act for this transaction

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines the severe global economic downturn and financial market crisis in 2008 and 2009 had significant adverse effects on our operations materially lowering both our fees from property and facilities management and valuations and our commissions from property sales leasing and financing as well as reducing the funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets commercial real estate markets have been gradually recovering since 2010 in step with the slow improvement in global economic activity 

  

during the economic downturn and financial market crisis weak economic conditions also affected our compensation expense which is structured to generally decrease in line with a fall in revenue compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions are particularly severe as they were in 2008 and 2009 we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance as general economic conditions and our financial performance have improved over the 

  

past four years we have restored certain expenses notwithstanding the gradual market recovery challenges to the macro economy remain and a return of adverse global and regional economic trends is one of the most significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition 

  

the global capital markets disruption in late 2008 caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales leasing financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and have steadily improved for the past four years most significantly in the united states reflecting a slow economic recovery vacancy rates and rental rates in the united states have improved modestly and steadily while the increased availability of lowcost credit and improved investor sentiment have sustained increases in property sales activity overall however occupiers and investors have remained cautious and both sales and leasing activity continue to be well below the peak levels experienced in 2006 and 2007 

  

in europe commercial real estate markets have been slower to recover than in the united states due to the sovereigndebt crisis which brought on a “double dip” recession the european economies began to emerge from recession in 2013 with most countries returning to positive though modest economic growth reflecting the macro environment investment sales across much of europe were tepid from 2011 through late 2012 sales activity began to improve in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the recovery continued in 2013 however leasing activity has remained slow and rents essentially flat across many major markets in europe as occupiers have been reluctant to make longterm space commitments 

  

following the global financial crisis real estate transaction activities in asia pacific revived significantly from late 2009 through late 2011 however leasing activity has been subdued since then as multinational corporations in particular have been hesitant to expand in the region on the other hand investment activity improved in 2013 following a softening in 2012 

  

real estate investment management and property development activity were also adversely affected by the global financial crisis which lowered property values and constrained financing and disposition opportunities however the macro environment for these businesses has generally improved as the real estate credit and investment sales markets have gradually recovered since 2010 

  

the further recovery of our global sales leasing investment management and development services operations depends on the continued improvement of market fundamentals including stronger economic growth and job creation stable healthy global credit markets and improved business and investor sentiment 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world in 2013 we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in europe within our emea segment with the acquisition of londonbased norland managed services ltd norland for approximately 475 million the norland acquisition norland is a premier provider of building technical engineering services that enables us to selfperform these services in europe and adds to our expertise in the highly specialized critical environments market in 2011 we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing group nv ing for a total purchase price of approximately 878 million which bolstered our global real estate investment management business and further diversified our service offerings the acquisitions of the former ing real estate management businesses collectively referred to as the reim acquisitions included substantially all of ing’s real estate investment management reim operations in europe and asia as well as substantially all of clarion real estate securities cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business along with certain cres coinvestments from ing and additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been quality regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest during 2013 we completed ten infill acquisitions most notably a leading firm serving the london prime residential real estate market a leading regional commercial real estate services firm based in san francisco a retail real estate services firm in the us midatlantic region a facility consulting and project advisory firm serving the healthcare industry and based in richmond virginia and two property management specialist firms – one in the czech republic and slovakia and one in belgium during 2012 we completed five infill acquisitions including our former affiliate companies in turkey and vietnam a niche real estate investment advisor and an independent commercial and residential property partnership in the united kingdom and a brokerage and property management firm in atlanta georgia in 2011 we completed five infill acquisitions including a valuation business in australia a retail property management business in central and eastern europe our former affiliate company in switzerland a retail services business in the united kingdom and a shopping center management business in the netherlands 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets in general most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example through december 31 2013 we incurred 1118 million of transactionrelated expenditures and integration costs in connection with the reim acquisitions 

  

international operations 

  

as we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to attempt to mitigate some of our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars 

  

our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management or aum as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which has seen continuing sovereign debt issues resulting in a more pronounced movement in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

  

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

we are leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2013 our total debt excluding our notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets inc or cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 20 billion 

  

our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place some constraints on the operation of our business although our management believes that longterm indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business including facilitating the reim acquisitions and the norland acquisition the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness 

  

for example during 2013 we completed a series of financing transactions that have meaningfully extended debt maturities lowered annual interest expense by approximately 50 million when compared to annualized interest expense before these refinancing actions and increased our financial flexibility these transactions included the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement which now provides for a 7150 million term loan facility and an expanded 12 billion revolving credit facility of which 1425 million was drawn at december 31 2013 the issuance of 8000 million aggregate principal amount of 500 senior notes due march 15 2023 and the redemption of all of the 11625 senior subordinated notes totaling 4500 million during the year ended december 31 2013 in connection with all of these financing activities we incurred approximately 286 million of financing costs of which 36 million was expensed in addition we expensed 178 million of previouslydeferred financing costs as well as a 262 million early extinguishment premium and 87 million of unamortized original issue discount associated with the 11625 senior subordinated notes 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue there are four basic criteria that must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord with the remaining portions of the lease commission earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent the existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements 

  

investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision with many of these investments our global investment management professionals have participation interests in such incentive fees which are commonly referred to as carried interest this carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period in addition our global investment management segment also earns successbased transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision 

  

we earn development and incentive development fees in our development services segment development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straightline basis over the development period incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectability our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

as required by the “ consolidations ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc or topic 810 we consolidate all vies in which we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the vie determining which reporting entity if any has a controlling financial interest in a vie is primarily a qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both 1 the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity the entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary 

  

we analyze any investments in vies to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance including but not limited to the ability to direct financing leasing construction and other operating decisions and activities in addition we consider the rights of other investors to participate in those decisions to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity 

  

we also have several coinvestments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential vies we continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to vies that are not consolidated we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

if an entity is not a vie our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant 

  

decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt 

  

under either the equity or cost method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value when testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments andor look to comparable activities in the marketplace management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach these assumptions include net asset values internal rates of return discount and capitalization rates interest rates and financing terms rental rates timing of leasing activity estimates of lease terms and related concessions etc when determining if impairment is otherthantemporary we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and nearterm prospects of each investment 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cbre services inc or cbre in 2001 the 2001 acquisition our acquisition of insignia financial group inc or insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition the trammell crow company acquisition in 2006 the reim acquisitions in 2011 and the norland acquisition in 2013 other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the reim acquisitions a trademark which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition and a trade name separately identified as a result of the reim acquisitions the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts and loan servicing rights which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year when we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1 2013 2012 and 2011 we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 981 million in our global investment management segment this noncash writeoff was related to a decrease in value of our openend funds primarily in europe during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 198 million in our emea segment related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the united kingdom see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2013 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 1270 million 18 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation cost capitalization and allocation disposition of real estate and discontinued operations 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets the “ property plant and equipment ” topic of fasb asc or topic 360 establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale consist of completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of topic 360’s “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance 

  

sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the “held for sale” criteria 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows management estimates or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally up to 39 years tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives up to 15 years 

  

when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons impairment charges of 265 million and 17 million were recorded for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively in addition during the year ended december 31 2011 we also recorded a provision for loss on real estate held for sale of 26 million 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under topic 360 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize recoverable costs capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy which are timing decisions that require judgment recoverable costs capitalized include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance interest development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations we do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the “ business combinations ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 805 pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values where practicable or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land land improvements building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense 

  

disposition of real estate 

  

gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project we evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method this evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated the adequacy of the buyer’s investment the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer with no substantial continuing involvement by us if the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer’s investment and our continuing involvement in some cases a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition 

  

discontinued operations 

  

topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction as defined in topic 360 a “component of an entity” comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity because each of our consolidated real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary many constitute a component of an entity under topic 360 increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur the evaluation of whether the component’s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for 

  

deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2013 and 2012 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes 

  

based on 580 million repatriated in 2012 and an estimated 1330 million to be repatriated in 2013 to the united states a 288 million tax benefit was recorded in 2012 during 2013 we actually repatriated 1962 million additional tax benefit of 145 million was recorded in 2013 we have not recorded a deferred tax liability for 11 billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the united states although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings or as a result of a sale or liquidation of nonus subsidiaries these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these nonus subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds net of foreign tax credits the determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable cash and cash equivalents owned by nonus subsidiaries totaled 3250 million at december 31 2013 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2013 2012 and 2011 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs income taxes depreciation and amortization while amounts shown for ebitda as adjusted remove the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions and cost containment expenses as well as certain carried interest incentive compensation expense our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to 

  

overall operating performance as a result our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs additionally we believe ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations 

  

however ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not recognized measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda and ebitda as adjusted in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda and ebitda as adjusted also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda and ebitda as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows dollars in thousands

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 120 million or 57 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the increase was partially due to higher legal fees incurred in 2012 increased costs stemming from an infill acquisition completed in australia as well as investments in china foreign currency translation had a 13 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2012 

  

global investment management 

  

revenue increased by 1925 million or 664 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 driven by contributions from the reim acquisitions acquired in the second half of 2011 foreign currency translation had a 143 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2012 

  

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 745 million or 238 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 this increase was primarily driven by an 

  

increase in costs attributable to the reim acquisition and a 93 million impairment charge on a real estate asset incurred in 2012 foreign currency translation had a 135 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2012 

  

total aum as of december 31 2012 amounted to 920 billion down 22 from yearend 2011 

  

development services 

  

revenue increased by 25 million or 33 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 attributable to an increase in incentive fees largely offset by lower rental revenue as a result of property dispositions in the later quarters of 2011 

  

operating administrative and other expenses decreased by 49 million or 46 for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 this decrease was primarily driven by lower bonus expense partially due to higher gains on property sales in 2011 as well as lower property operating expenses as a result of the property dispositions noted above in this segment’s revenue discussion these decreases were mostly offset by higher impairment charges related to real estate assets incurred in 2012 

  

as of december 31 2012 development projects in process totaled 42 billion down 07 billion from yearend 2011 the inventory of pipeline deals totaled 21 billion up 09 billion from yearend 2011 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2014 include up to approximately 185 million of anticipated net capital expenditures as of december 31 2013 we had committed to fund 250 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which may be called at any time additionally as of december 31 2013 we had aggregate commitments of 94 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 81 million of which is expected to be funded in 2014 in recent years the global credit markets have remained tight which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future 

  

in 2013 we fortified our real estate outsourcing platform in europe with the acquisition of londonbased norland for approximately 475 million which was financed with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility during 2011 we required substantial amounts of debt financing to fund the reim acquisitions the acquisitions included substantially all of the ing reim operations in europe and asia as well as substantially all of cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business as well as certain cres coinvestments from ing and additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia on july 1 2011 we acquired cres for 3328 million and cres coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 586 million using borrowings from our term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions on october 3 2011 we acquired ing reim’s operations in asia for 453 million and three ing reim asia coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 139 million using borrowings from our term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions on october 31 2011 we completed the ing reim europe portion of the reim acquisitions acquiring ing reim’s operations in europe for 4415 million and one coinvestment from ing for 74 million using borrowings from our term loan facility under our credit agreement cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions during the year ended december 31 2012 we also funded nine additional coinvestments for an aggregate amount of 345 million related to ing reim europe 

  

we also conducted three debt offerings in recent years the first in 2009 was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession the second in 2010 was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability and the third in march 2013 was also to take advantage of market conditions to refinance 

  

other debt absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009 as well as the debt offerings we completed in 2009 2010 and march 2013 we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary events we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months from time to time we may again seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt securities with new debt securities at lower interest rates with longer maturities or at better terms 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the united kingdom our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall during 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report was 680 million and 635 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 62 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2014 

  

the third longterm liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we had 869 million and 147 million respectively of deferred purchase consideration outstanding included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other longterm liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 7451 million for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 4540 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 this variance was primarily due to a decrease in real estate held for sale and under development and higher bonus accruals in the current year in addition improved operating performance and greater collections on receivables in the current year contributed to the variance these items were partially offset by higher bonus payments made in the current year 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2911 million for the year ended december 31 2012 a decrease of 701 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2012 was primarily due to higher bonuses commissions and income taxes paid and activities associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of cres in addition increases in receivables and real estate held for sale and under development in 2012 as well as higher tenant concessions received in 2011 also contributed to the variance these items were partially offset by improved operating performance and an increase in accounts payable in 2012 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4650 million for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 2673 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 this variance was primarily driven by greater amounts paid for acquisitions in the current year this was partially offset by higher proceeds received from the sale of real estate held for investment in the current year and a decrease in cash in the prior year as a result of the deconsolidation of cbre clarion us lp in 2012 higher contributions to unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2012 greater distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries in the current year and a decrease in restricted cash in the current year versus an increase in restricted cash in the prior year also mitigated the increase in cash used in investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1977 million for the year ended december 31 2012 a decrease of 2826 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in 2012 was primarily driven by a greater amount of cash paid for the reim acquisitions in 2011 this was partially offset by higher net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment in 2011 a decrease in cash as a result of the deconsolidation of cbre clarion us lp in 2012 and higher distributions from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2011 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 8663 million for the year ended december 31 2013 an increase of 7656 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2012 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to our refinancing efforts during the year ended december 31 2013 including the net repayment of 9240 million of senior secured term loans and the redemption of 4500 million of 11625 senior subordinated notes partially offset by the issuance of 8000 million of 500 senior notes in addition higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our development services segment in the current year and higher distributions to noncontrolling interests in the current year also contributed to the increase 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 1007 million for the year ended december 31 2012 versus net cash provided by financing activities of 7113 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to 8000 million of tranche c and d term loan facilities drawn in 2011 to finance the reim acquisitions and proceeds from the british pound sterling a1 term loan facility received in 2011 this was partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate in 2011 greater distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2011 as well as more financing costs paid in 2011

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report was 680 million and 635 million at december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 62 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2014 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 111 million as of december 31 2013 excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases these letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through december 2014 

  

we had guarantees totaling 143 million as of december 31 2013 excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet and operating leases the 143 million partly consists of guarantees 

  

related to our defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom in excess of our outstanding pension liability of 680 million as of december 31 2013 which are continuous guarantees that will not expire until all amounts have been paid out for our pension liabilities the remainder of the guarantees mainly represents guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries which expire at varying dates through june 2017 as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements 

  

in addition as of december 31 2013 we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects these guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our development services business each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget however we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees these contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 

  

in january 2008 cbre multifamily capital inc or cbre mci a whollyowned subsidiary of cbre capital markets inc entered into an agreement with fannie mae under fannie mae’s delegated underwriting and servicing lender program or dus program to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units under the dus program cbre mci originates underwrites closes and services loans without prior approval by fannie mae and in selected cases is subject to sharing up to onethird of any losses on loans originated under the dus program cbre mci has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of 78 billion at december 31 2013 additionally cbre mci has funded loans under the dus program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately 3690 million at december 31 2013 cbre mci under its agreement with fannie mae must post cash reserves under formulas established by fannie mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur as of december 31 2013 and 2012 cbre mci had 166 million and 91 million respectively of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement and had provided approximately 138 million and 106 million respectively of loan loss accruals fannie mae’s recourse under the dus program is limited to the assets of cbre mci which totaled approximately 3674 million including 2264 million of warehouse receivables a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to fannie mae at december 31 2013 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 20 to 50 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2013 we had aggregate commitments of 94 million to fund future coinvestments 81 million of which is expected to be funded in 2014 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2013 we had committed to fund 250 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries which may be called at any time 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities tends to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have generally been concentrated in the 

  

fourth quarter due to the focus on completing sales financing and leasing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in march 2013 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued accounting standards update or asu 201305 “foreign currency matters topic 830 parent’s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity” this asu states that when a reporting entity parent ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business other than a sale of in substance real estate or conveyance of oil and gas mineral rights within a foreign entity the parent is required to apply the guidance in subtopic 83030 to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income accordingly the cumulative translation adjustment should be released into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided asu 201305 is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 with early adoption permitted we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in july 2013 the fasb issued asu 201311 “ income taxes topic 740 presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists ” this asu states that an unrecognized tax benefit or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward except as follows to the extent a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use and the entity does not intend to use the deferred tax asset for such purpose the unrecognized tax benefit should be presented in the financial statements as a liability and should not be combined with deferred tax assets this asu applies to all entities that have unrecognized tax benefits when a net operating loss carryforward a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists at the reporting date this asu is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2013 with early adoption permitted this asu should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date with retrospective application permitted we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2013 approximately 39 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese yuan the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2013 foreign currency translation had a 734 million negative impact on our total revenue and a 603 million positive impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings on march 22 2013 we entered into three option agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 95 million euros which expired on june 26 2013 one to sell a notional amount of 45 million euros which expired on september 26 2013 and one to sell a notional amount of 210 million euros which expired on december 27 2013 on september 4 2013 we entered into two option agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 61 million british pounds sterling which expired on september 26 2013 and one to sell a notional amount of 137 million british pounds sterling which expired on december 27 2013 included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were losses of 18 million and 44 million for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 respectively resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements as of december 31 2013 and 2012 we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2013 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

  

    

   

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 100 on our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2013 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 25 million on pretax income and a decrease of 25 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2013 

  

the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately 6876 million at december 31 2013 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 500 senior notes and 6625 senior notes were 7694 million and 3728 million respectively at december 31 2013 

  

in march 2011 we entered into five interest rate swap agreements all with effective dates in october 2011 and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with topic 815 the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities the total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is 4000 million with 2000 million expiring in october 2017 and 2000 million expiring in september 2019 there was no significant hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended december 31 2013 and 2012 as of december 31 2013 the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a 290 million liability and were included in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

we also have 1305 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2013 these notes have interest rates ranging from 242 to 604 with maturity dates extending through 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 100 our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 06 million for the year ended december 31 2013 from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant 

  

we also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale fasb asc topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework 1992 issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission we acquired londonbased norland managed services ltd during 2013 “acquired business” as defined in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements and we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 the acquired business’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of 6802 million included in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2013 based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2013 the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2013 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

chief executive officer and the chief financial officer in this evaluation based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the securities exchange act rule 13a15c as of the end of the period covered by this report

cbre group inc a delaware corporation which may be referred to in this form 10k as the “company” “we” “us” and “our” is the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm based on 2012 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2012 excluding independent affiliates we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide with approximately 37000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cbre” brand name investment management services under the “cbre global investors” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales real estate investment management valuation commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research we generate revenues from management fees on a contractual and perproject basis and from commissions on transactions our contractual feeforservices businesses which generally involve facilities management property management mortgage loan servicing and investment management represented approximately 41 of our 2012 revenue 

  

we generated revenue from a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients in 2012 our client roster included approximately 80 of the fortune 100 companies and consisted of firms in a broad range of industries as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

property owners occupiers and investors continue to consolidate their needs with fewer service providers and are awarding their business to firms that have strong capabilities across major markets and service disciplines we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing and disproportionate share of the business being awarded as a result of these trends 

  

in 2012 for the second year in a row we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the fortune most admired companies and were also named the global real estate advisor of the year by euromoney  we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 since 2006 and in the fortune 500 since 2008 additionally the international association of outsourcing professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for six consecutive years including in 2012 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company 

  

cbre history 

  

cbre marked its 106 th year of continuous operations in 2012 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake since then we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services firm in terms of 2012 revenue through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions including the december 2006 purchase of trammell crow company which significantly deepened our outsourcing service offerings and the 2011 acquisition of the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing group nv ing which bolstered our global real estate investment management business and further diversified our service offerings the ing acquisitions included substantially all of ing’s real estate investment management reim operations in europe and asia as well as substantially all of clarion real estate securities cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business collectively referred to as ing reim along with certain cres coinvestments from ing and additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia 

  

we have also historically enhanced and complemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialty firms that are leaders in their areas of focus including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships these “infill” acquisitions remain an integral part of our longterm strategy 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

cbre group inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries cbre services inc our direct whollyowned subsidiary is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness 

  

we report our operations through the following segments 1 americas 2 europe middle east and africa or emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services

the americas 

  

the americas is our largest reporting segment comprised of operations throughout the united states and canada as well as key markets in latin america our operations are largely whollyowned but also include independent affiliates which license the use of the “cbre” and “cb richard ellis” names in their local markets in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us and an agreement to crossrefer business between us and the affiliate

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms including professional development and training market research and information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through cbre research  consulting and cbre econometric advisors or cbreea our commercial real estate market information and forecasting groups

markets inc or cbre capital markets and ge capital real estate serviced approximately 1064 billion of mortgage loans 669 billion of which related to the servicing rights of cbre capital markets 

  

   

outsourcing services 

  

outsourcing commercial real estate services is a longterm trend in our industry with corporations institutions public sector entities health care providers and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of thirdparty real estate specialists our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend 1 corporate services and 2 asset services agreements with our corporate services clients are generally longterm arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination there are usually penalties for early termination our management agreements with our asset services clients may be terminated with notice generally ranging between 30 to 90 days however we have developed longterm relationships with many of these clients and we work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships as of december 31 2012 we managed approximately 15 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers in the americas which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the region our outsourcing services business line accounted for 280 of our 2012 consolidated worldwide revenue 277 of our 2011 consolidated worldwide revenue and 279 of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue

competition

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2012 excluding our independent affiliates we had approximately 37000 employees worldwide approximately 44 of which are fully reimbursed by clients and are mostly in our outsourcing services lines of business at december 31 2012 967 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business in new york new jersey illinois and california we believe that relations with our employees are generally good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cbre” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cbre” “cb richard ellis” and “trammell crow” names with respect to the cbre and cb richard ellis names we maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cbre and cb richard ellis related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have begun enacting various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit the release such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the material risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by economic slowdowns liquidity crises fiscal uncertainty and possible subsequent downturns in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities 

  

many of the world’s largest economies and financial institutions continue to be impacted by ongoing global economic and financial issues with some continuing to face financial difficulty fiscal uncertainty pressure on asset prices liquidity problems and limited availability of credit made worse in certain areas by increased unemployment or limited economic growth it is uncertain how long these effects will last or whether economic and financial trends in those areas particularly in europe will worsen or improve the current economic situation may be exacerbated if additional negative geopolitical or economic developments natural disasters or other disruptions were to arise 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines 

  

our business is significantly impacted by generally prevailing economic conditions in the principal markets where we operate which can result in a general decline in real estate acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development or investment management activities our capital markets business could also suffer from any political or economic disruption that impacts interest rates or liquidity in addition we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our global investment management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated these economic conditions could also lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development 

  

our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets during an economic downturn investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties the performance of these properties may be impacted by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control including i real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally ii our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and iii the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed conditions 

  

for example during 2008 and 2009 credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession these adverse macro conditions impacted commercial real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations similar to other commercial real estate services firms our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009 and as a result our stock price declined significantly if the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate 

  

most recently in the united states we believe that the prospect of higher capital gains taxes drove an increase in transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012 but that continued uncertainty over fiscal and tax policy has caused and may continue to do so in 2013 our clients to delay or cancel commercial real estate transactions which may impact our revenues the economic situation in europe has been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of a default by certain nations on their debt obligations and the possibility of a eurozone breakup if such a default or breakup occurs or if the measures taken to avert such a default or breakup create their own instability the adverse impact will likely be global and significant 

  

fiscal uncertainty as well as significant changes and volatility in the financial markets and business environment and in the global political security and competitive landscape make it increasingly difficult for us to predict our revenue and earnings into the future as a result any revenue or earnings guidance or outlook which we have given or might give may be overtaken by events or may otherwise turn out to be inaccurate though we endeavor to give reasonable estimates of future revenue and earnings at the time we give such guidance based on thencurrent conditions there is a significant risk that such guidance or outlook will turn out to be or to have been incorrect 

  

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of commercial real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

in 2008 and 2009 the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude this disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding in some cases these sources were eliminated while the credit market has improved since the second half of 2009 liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy this uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to total interest expense of 225x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 375x our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios 

  

when required for example we experienced a decline in ebitda during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009 which negatively impacted our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio however we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009 and as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business we were and continue to be well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 1045x for the year ended december 31 2012 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 138x as of december 31 2012 we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain nonus subsidiaries in addition in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations we established term loans totaling approximately 8000 million under our credit agreement in 2011 to finance the reim acquisitions as of december 31 2012 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 25 billion for the year ended december 31 2012 our interest expense was approximately 1751 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase if we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement our debt service obligations may be substantially increased 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

from time to time moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our class a common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments 

  

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which if accomplished may adversely impact our stock price 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre capital markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

if we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties it could adversely affect our business 

  

we could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition as a result a client may fail to make payments when due become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any client bankruptcy or insolvency or the failure of any client to make payments when due could result in losses to our company a client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us additionally certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients if such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client 

  

the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty which may include cobrokers lenders insurance companies hedging counterparties service providers or other organizations with which we do business or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price for example due to the severe market downturn and credit crisis we determined in december 2008 that the negative impact of the global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as a result we incurred charges of 12 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2008 a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including robert e sulentic our president and chief executive officer mr sulentic and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees including those acquired through acquisitions or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel we use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize many of our key personnel any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2012 we generated approximately 40 of our revenue from operations outside the united states with the reim acquisitions the footprint of our global investment management business significantly expanded particularly in europe and asia additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we maintain anticorruption and antimoney laundering compliance programs throughout the company violations of our compliance programs may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2012 approximately 40 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese yuan the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which has seen a continuing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a notable drop in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management revenue and earnings 

  

over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and the euro relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar and the euro may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed additionally economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future or perform as expected 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of the trammell crow company in december 2006 and the reim acquisitions that we completed in the second half of 2011 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available 

  

to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase in addition acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

  

we have had and may continue to experience challenges in integrating operations and information technology systems acquired from other companies this could result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels 

  

the anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions may not be realized as we contemplated 

  

we completed the reim acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits including among others enhanced revenues and margins a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties including the realization of accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 

  

our revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments 

  

with the completion of the reim acquisitions our global investment management business significantly increased and became more globally diverse with the addition of the reim funds a substantial part of our fees are more recurring in nature however the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business are all somewhat variable primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another 

  

the pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control the underlying market conditions decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another 

  

a substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage and if asset values deteriorate our asset management fees will decline as a result our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delay in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity we also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or absolute return hurdles finally during periods of economic weakness or recession existing and prospective clients in our global investment management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes thereby inhibiting the ability of our global investment management business to raise new funds additionally investors with open commitments to provide additional investment could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments and seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are 

  

obligated to pay to the extent that clients in our global investment management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed we could experience a decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business 

  

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2012 we had committed 317 million to fund future coinvestments 279 million of which is expected to be funded during 2013 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is a very important part of our global investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 35 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 116 million and 139 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us in addition to being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable in addition at december 31 2012 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 45 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 589 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 143 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 22 million excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

  

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could 

  

experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintain our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

  

we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities andor damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions 

  

the advice and services we render in our financial and valuation advisory businesses and the investment decisions we make in our global investment management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs differences between actual values and appraised values and a variety of other litigation claims including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment discretion control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients for example in our valuation and appraisal business if market dynamics lead to a reduction in the market value of properties we have previously appraised we may be subject to a higher risk of claims including conflicts of interest claims based on the circumstances of valuations previously issued our valuation and appraisal services involve transactions where the value of the transaction is much greater than the fees we generate as a result the consequences of errors that lead to damages might be disproportionately large in relation to the fees generated in the event our contractual protections or our insurance coverage are inadequate to protect us fully 

  

to the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct investors may have remedies against us our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law moreover we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed 

  

some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate however in the event of a substantial loss our commercial insurance coverage andor selfinsurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain types of claims further the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highlyrated companies any of these events could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business as well as investors for our global investment management business as a result allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities whether or not valid may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our global investment management business and our other 

  

global businesses in addition if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us which could materially impact our business 

  

a failure to appropriately deal with actual or perceived conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses 

  

our company has a global platform with different business lines and a broad client base and is therefore subject to numerous potential actual or perceived conflicts of interests in the provision of services to our existing and potential clients for example conflicts may arise from our position as broker to both owners and tenants in commercial real estate lease transactions we have adopted various policies controls and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts but these policies and procedures may not be adequate and may not be adhered to by our employees appropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged and cause us to lose existing clients or fail to gain new clients if we fail or appear to fail to identify disclose and manage potential conflicts of interest which could have an adverse affect on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that in some jurisdictions regulations could be changed to limit our ability to act for parties where conflicts exist even with informed consent which could limit our market share in those markets there can be no assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise in the future that could cause material harm to us 

  

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2012 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours in general there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed if there was an economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2012 approximately 10 of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california economic downturns in the california commercial real estate market similar to recent downturns experienced in california and particularly in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could cause an adverse effect on our results 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions that involve different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter 

  

our estimate of tax related assets liabilities recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to the tax laws in various jurisdictions the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions taxable income projections and the benefits of various restructuring plans to the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities 

  

we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures there are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits we have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding however we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage our failure to do so andor the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position 

  

if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets which are incorporated herein by reference was 635 million and 609 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity 

  

if we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties 

  

our business depends in part on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property such as our service marks client lists and information business methods and research 

  

existing laws or the application of those laws of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and on patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims may harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services 

  

confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices such as laptop computers which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted 

  

failure to maintain the security of our information and technology networks including personally identifiable and client information could adversely affect us 

  

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability which could cause our business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of our business we collect and store sensitive data including our proprietary business information and intellectual property and that of our clients and personally identifiable information of our employees and contractors in our data centers and on our networks the secure processing maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations despite our security measures our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error malfeasance or other disruptions a significant actual or potential theft loss fraudulent use or misuse of client employee or other personally identifiable data whether by third parties or as a result of employee malfeasance or otherwise noncompliance with our contractual or other legal obligations regarding such data or a violation of our privacy and security policies with respect to such data could result in significant costs fines litigation or regulatory actions against us such an event could additionally disrupt our operations and the services we provide to clients damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our services which could adversely affect our business revenues and competitive position additionally we increasingly rely on thirdparty data storage providers including cloud storage solution providers resulting in less direct control over our data such third parties may also be vulnerable to security breaches and compromised security systems which could adversely affect our reputation 

  

interruption or failure of our information technology communications systems or data services could hurt our ability to effectively provide our services which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 

  

our business requires the continued operation of information technology and communication systems and network infrastructure our ability to conduct our global business may be adversely impacted by disruptions to these systems or infrastructure our information technology and communications systems are vulnerable to damage or disruption from fire power loss telecommunications failure system malfunctions computer viruses natural disasters such as hurricanes earthquakes and floods acts of war or terrorism or other events which are beyond our control in addition the operation and maintenance of these systems and networks is in some cases dependent on thirdparty technologies systems and service providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability any of these events could cause system interruption delays and loss of critical data or intellectual property and may also disrupt our ability to provide services to or interact with our clients and we may not be able to successfully implement contingency plans that depend on communication or travel we have disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events but our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient and cannot account for all eventualities and a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 

  

the infrastructure disruptions we describe above may also disrupt our ability to manage real estate for clients or may adversely affect the value of real estate investments we make on behalf of clients the buildings we manage for clients which include some of the world’s largest office properties and retail centers are used by numerous people daily as a result fires earthquakes floods other natural disasters defects and terrorist attacks can result in significant loss of life and to the extent we are held to have been negligent in connection with our management of the affected properties we could incur significant financial liabilities and reputational harm 

  

our business relies significantly on the use of commercial real estate data we produce much of this data internally but a significant portion is purchased from thirdparty providers for which there is no certainty of uninterrupted availability a disruption of our ability to provide data to our professionals andor clients could damage our reputation and our operating results could be adversely affected 

  

our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected by new laws or regulations or by changes in existing laws or regulations or the application thereof if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us including in our role as a real estate broker registered investment advisor mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business as well as laws of broader applicability such as tax securities environmental and employment laws brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked a number of our services including the services provided by our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries cbre capital markets and cbre global investors are subject to regulation by the sec finra or other selfregulatory organizations and state securities regulators and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance with these regulations which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

  

as the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased the global economic crisis has resulted in increased government and legislative activities including the introduction of new legislation and changes to rules and regulations which we expect will continue into the future new or revised legislation or regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states as well as changes in administrations or enforcement priorities may have an adverse effect on our business including increasing the costs of compliance or preventing us from providing certain types of services in certain jurisdictions or in connection with certain transactions or clients we are unable to predict how any of these new laws rules regulations and proposals will be implemented or in what form or whether any additional or similar changes to laws or regulations including the interpretation or implementation thereof will occur in the future any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our businesses financial condition results of operations and prospects 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this 

  

liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral in the event of a substantial liability our insurance coverage might be insufficient to pay the full damages or the scope of available coverage may not cover certain of these liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2012 

  

   

some of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segments also contain employees of our other business segments often the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices we have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our global investment management and development services offices to avoid double counting 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm based on 2012 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2012 excluding independent affiliates we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide with approximately 37000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cbre” brand name investment management services under the “cbre global investors” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales real estate investment management valuation commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research we generate revenue from management fees on a contractual and perproject basis and from commissions on transactions we have been the only commercial real estate services company in the sp 500 since 2006 and in the fortune 500 since 2008 in 2012 for the second year in a row we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the fortune most admired companies and were also named the global real estate advisor of the year by euromoney  additionally the international association of outsourcing professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for six consecutive years including 2012 when we ranked fourth overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company in its most recent subscriber survey conducted in late 2011 we achieved the highest brand reputation ranking among all commercial real estate companies in a survey of wall street journal subscribers 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates fiscal uncertainty declining employment levels decreasing demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values disruption to the global capital or credit markets or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines from late 2007 through 2009 the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations and materially reduced our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing and reduced the funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets these negative trends began to reverse in early 2010 and commercial real estate markets have improved gradually for the past three years in step with the slow recovery of global economic activity 

  

weak economic conditions from late 2007 through 2009 also affected our compensation expense which is structured to generally decrease in line with a fall in revenue compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition when negative economic conditions are particularly severe as they were in 2008 and 2009 we have moved decisively to improve financial performance by lowering operating expenses as general economic conditions and our financial performance improved we restored certain expenses beginning in 2010 

  

notwithstanding the ongoing slow market recovery a return of adverse global and regional economic trends given us fiscal uncertainty a continuing sovereign debt crisis in europe and slower growth in china remains one of the most significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition 

  

economic conditions first began to negatively affect our performance in the americas our largest segment in terms of revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2007 the effects became more severe as the decline in economic activity particularly in the united states accelerated throughout 2008 and most of 2009 the global capital markets disruption in late 2008 in particular caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales leasing financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and have steadily improved for the past three years due to the slow but positive economic recovery in the united states reflecting this gradual recovery national vacancy rates in the united states declined modestly and rental rates rose slightly in 2012 while the ready availability of lowcost credit and investors’ search for yield sustained continued increases in property sales activity overall however occupiers and investors have remained cautious and both sales and leasing activity continued to be well below the levels experienced in 2006 and 2007 

  

in europe weak market conditions first became evident in the united kingdom in late 2007 and in countries on the continent in early 2008 the major european economies fell into recession in 2008 which deepened and persisted throughout 2009 economic activity improved in 2010 but began to weaken again in 2011 and 2012 due to the effects of the european sovereign debt crisis as a result economic growth in europe has lagged behind other parts of the world for the past two years while rents have essentially remained flat leasing velocity has slowed in many major markets in europe as occupiers hesitate to make longterm space commitments investment sales in europe were adversely affected by the financial crisis in late 2008 and most of 2009 although they recovered strongly in 2010 particularly in larger markets investment sales have been tepid across most of europe for the past two years european sovereign debt issues and weak economic growth have resulted in a polarization of the investment market with capital flowing primarily to markets perceived as safe havens such as the united kingdom 

  

real estate markets in asia pacific were also affected though generally to a lesser degree than in the united states and europe by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn in 2008 and 2009 this resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in the region transaction activity revived significantly in late 2009 and remained strong throughout 2010 and most of 2011 however transaction activity has moderated for the past 18 months as both occupiers and investors have become more cautious reflecting slower domestic growth and the effects of economic uncertainty in the united states and europe on the region’s exportbased economies 

  

real estate investment management and property development activity were also adversely affected by deteriorating conditions beginning in late 2007 driving down property values and constraining financing and disposition opportunities however the macro environment for these businesses has generally improved as the real estate credit and investment sales markets have gradually recovered for the past three years 

  

the further recovery of our global sales leasing investment management and development services operations depends on the continued strengthening of market fundamentals including more robust economic growth and job creation stable and healthy global credit markets and improved business and investor confidence 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world in december 2006 we acquired the trammell crow company the trammell crow company acquisition our largest acquisition to date which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

in 2011 we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing group nv ing the acquisitions included substantially all of ing’s real estate investment management reim operations in europe and asia as well as substantially all of clarion real estate securities cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business collectively referred to as ing reim along with certain cres coinvestments from ing and additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia 

  

on july 1 2011 we completed the acquisition of cres for 3328 million and cres coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 586 million on october 3 2011 we completed the acquisition of ing reim asia for 453 million and three ing reim asia coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 139 million on october 31 2011 we completed the acquisition of ing reim europe for 4415 million and one coinvestment from ing for 74 million during the year ended december 31 2012 we also funded nine additional coinvestments for an aggregate amount of 345 million related to ing reim europe upon completion of the acquisitions which we refer to as the reim acquisitions ing reim became part of our global investment management segment which conducts business through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre global investors an independently operated business segment the ing reim businesses were highly complementary to our existing investment management business with little overlap in client base and different investment strategies cbre global investors traditionally focused on valueadd funds and separate accounts ing reim primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds except in asia where ing reim managed valueadd and opportunistic funds the combined entity provides us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies 

  

as of december 31 2012 cbre global investors’ assets under management or aum totaled 920 billion aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide or participate in oversight investment management services and other advice and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market not the basis for determining our management fees our material assets under management consist of 

  

   

   

our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings the companies we acquired have generally been quality regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which in some cases we held a small equity interest from 2005 to 2010 we completed 60 infill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 601 million with most of these completed before the recession in 2008 in 2011 we completed five infill acquisitions including a valuation business in australia a retail property management business in central and eastern europe our former affiliate company in switzerland a retail services business in the united kingdom and a shopping center management business in the netherlands during 

  

2012 we completed five infill acquisitions including our former affiliate companies in turkey and vietnam a niche real estate investment advisor and an independent commercial and residential property partnership in the united kingdom and a brokerage and property management firm in atlanta as market conditions continue to improve we believe acquisitions may once again serve as a growth engine supplementing our organic growth 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example through december 31 2012 we incurred 2589 million of transactionrelated expenditures and integration costs in connection with the trammell crow company acquisition in addition through december 31 2012 we incurred 1094 million of transactionrelated expenditures and integration costs in connection with the reim acquisitions 

  

international operations 

  

as we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars 

  

our global investment management business has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which has seen a developing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a more pronounced movement in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

  

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2012 our total debt excluding our notes payable on real estate which are generally nonrecourse to us and warehouse lines of credit which are recourse only to our whollyowned subsidiary cbre capital markets inc or cbre capital markets and are secured by our related warehouse receivables was approximately 25 billion 

  

our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place constraints on the operation of our business although our management believes that longterm indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business including facilitating the trammell crow company acquisition and the reim acquisitions the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our 

  

business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue there are four basic criteria that must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord with the remaining portions of the lease commission earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent the existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements 

  

investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of 

  

the related investment management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees which are commonly referred to as carried interest this carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period in addition our global investment management segment also earns successbased transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on behalf of certain funds and separate accounts such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision 

  

we earn development and incentive development fees in our development services segment development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straightline basis over the development period incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectability our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this report all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

as required by the “ consolidations ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc or topic 810 we consolidate all vies in which we are the entity’s primary beneficiary a reporting entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest in the vie determining which reporting entity if any has a controlling financial interest in a vie is primarily a qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both 1 the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity the entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary 

  

we analyze any investments in vies to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance including but not limited to the ability to direct financing leasing construction and other operating decisions and activities in addition we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity 

  

we also have several coinvestments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the qualitative approach for analyzing potential vies we continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to vies that are not consolidated we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

if an entity is not a vie our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the 

  

basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt 

  

under either the equity or cost method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value when testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments andor look to comparable activities in the marketplace management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach these assumptions include net asset values internal rates of return discount and capitalization rates interest rates and financing terms rental rates timing of leasing activity estimates of lease terms and related concessions etc when determining if impairment is otherthantemporary we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and nearterm prospects of each investment 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cbre services inc or cbre in 2001 the 2001 acquisition our acquisition of insignia financial group inc or insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition the trammell crow company acquisition in 2006 and the reim acquisitions in 2011 other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the reim acquisitions a trademark which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition and a trade name separately identified as a result of the reim acquisitions the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts and loan servicing rights which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of 

  

the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year when we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1 2012 2011 and 2010 we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value during the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded a nonamortizable intangible asset impairment of 198 million in our emea segment related to the discontinuation of the use of a trade name in the united kingdom 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2012 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 3792 million 49 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation cost capitalization and allocation disposition of real estate and discontinued operations 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets the “ property plant and equipment ” topic of fasb asc or topic 360 establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale consist of completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of topic 360’s “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the “held for sale” criteria 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows management estimates or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally up to 39 years tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives up to 15 years 

  

when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons impairment charges of 265 million 17 million and 246 million were recorded for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively in addition during the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of 26 million and 23 million respectively 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under topic 360 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment had we evaluated our assets differently the balance sheet classification of such assets depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize costs capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy which are timing decisions that require judgment costs capitalized include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance interest development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations we do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the “ business combinations ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 805 pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made a difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values where practicable or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land land improvements building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense if we use different estimates in these valuations the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements to be different 

  

disposition of real estate 

  

gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project we evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method this evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated the adequacy of the buyer’s investment the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer with no substantial continuing involvement by us if the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer’s investment and our continuing involvement in some cases a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition 

  

discontinued operations 

  

topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction as defined in topic 360 a “component of an entity” comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary many constitute a component of an entity under topic 360 increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur the evaluation of whether the component’s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2012 and 2011 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes 

  

during 2012 we identified opportunities to repatriate 1910 million to the united states 580 million in 2012 and 1330 million in 2013 which resulted in 288 million of tax benefit in 2012 we have not recorded a deferred tax liability for 11 billion of remaining undistributed earnings of subsidiaries located outside of the united states although tax liabilities might result from the payment of dividends out of such earnings or as a result of a sale or liquidation of nonus subsidiaries these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the united states and we do not have any plans to repatriate these earnings or to sell or liquidate any of these nonus subsidiaries to the extent that we are able to repatriate the unremitted earnings in a tax efficient manner or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy in which such funds become needed for funding our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds net of foreign tax credits the determination of the tax liability upon repatriation is not practicable cash and cash equivalents owned by nonus subsidiaries totaled 2634 million at december 31 2012 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs income taxes depreciation and amortization while amounts shown for ebitda as adjusted remove the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions cost containment and asset impairments our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant 

  

component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs additionally we believe ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations 

  

however ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not recognized measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda and ebitda as adjusted in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda and ebitda as adjusted also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda and ebitda as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2013 include up to approximately 160 million of anticipated net capital expenditures as of 

  

december 31 2012 we had aggregate commitments of 317 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business 279 million of which is expected to be funded in 2013 additionally as of december 31 2012 we had committed to fund 143 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time in recent years the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future 

  

in 2011 we acquired the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing the acquisitions included substantially all of the ing reim operations in europe and asia as well as substantially all of cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business as well as certain cres coinvestments from ing and additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia on july 1 2011 we acquired cres for 3328 million and cres coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 586 million using borrowings from our tranche d term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions on october 3 2011 we acquired ing reim’s operations in asia for 453 million and three ing reim asia coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 139 million using borrowings from our tranche c term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions on october 31 2011 we completed the ing reim europe portion of the reim acquisitions acquiring ing reim’s operations in europe for 4415 million and one coinvestment from ing for 74 million using borrowings from our tranche c term loan facility under our credit agreement cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions during the year ended december 31 2012 we also funded nine additional coinvestments for an aggregate amount of 345 million related to ing reim europe 

  

during 2003 and 2006 we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company we also conducted two debt offerings in recent years the first in 2009 was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession and the second in 2010 was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009 we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary events we anticipate that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months from time to time we may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance existing debt securities with new debt securities at lower interest rates longer maturities or better terms 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the united kingdom our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans 

  

to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall during 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report was 635 million and 609 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 55 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2013

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2911 million for the year ended december 31 2012 a decrease of 701 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the current year was primarily due to higher bonuses commissions and income taxes paid and activities associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of cres in addition increases in receivables and real estate held for sale and under development in the current year as well as higher tenant concessions received in the prior year also contributed to the variance these items were partially offset by improved operating performance and an increase in accounts payable in the current year 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3612 million for the year ended december 31 2011 a decrease of 2554 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was primarily due to higher bonuses commissions and income taxes paid in 2011 these items were partially offset by an increase in bonus accruals in 2011 activity associated with securities acquired in our acquisition of cres a greater decrease in real estate held for sale and under development in 2011 and a greater increase in receivables in 2010 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1977 million for the year ended december 31 2012 a decrease of 2826 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 the decrease in cash used in investing activities in the current year was primarily driven by a greater amount of cash paid for the reim acquisitions in the prior year this was partially offset by higher net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment in the prior year a decrease in cash as a result of the deconsolidation of cbre clarion us lp in the current year and higher distributions from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the prior year 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4803 million for the year ended december 31 2011 an increase of 4178 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily driven by cash paid for the reim acquisitions and higher capital expenditures in 2011 these increases were partially offset by net proceeds received from the disposition of real estate held for investment and higher distributions received from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in 2011 

  

financing activities

cash used in financing activities was primarily due to 8000 million of tranche c and d term loan facilities drawn in the prior year to finance the reim acquisitions and proceeds from the british pound sterling a1 term loan facility received in the prior year this was partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate in the prior year greater distributions to noncontrolling interests in the prior year as well as more financing costs paid in the prior year 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 7113 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 7842 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to net proceeds from senior secured loans in 2011 to finance the reim acquisitions and the new british pound sterling a1 term loan facility entered into in 2011 versus significant net repayments of our senior secured term loans in 2010 these items were partially offset by higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our development services segment and greater distributions to noncontrolling interests in 2011

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 20 to 

  

50 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2012 we had aggregate commitments of 317 million to fund future coinvestments 279 million of which is expected to be funded in 2013 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2012 we had committed to fund 143 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries which may be called at any time 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2011 the fasb issued accounting standards update or asu 201110 “ property plant and equipment topic 360 derecognition of in substance real estate—a scope clarification” this asu requires that a reporting entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary’s nonrecourse debt would apply fasb asc subtopic 36020 “ property plant and equipment—real estate sales ” to determine whether to derecognize assets and liabilities of that subsidiary asu 201110 is effective prospectively for a deconsolidation event that takes place in fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june 15 2012 we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201111 “ balance sheet topic 210 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” this asu adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements in january 2013 the fasb issued asu 201301 “ balance sheet topic 210 clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” which clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables in general are not in the scope of asu 201111 both asu 201111 and asu 201301 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after january 1 2013 with retrospective application required we do not believe the adoption of these updates will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments 

  

we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2012 approximately 40 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese yuan the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2012 foreign currency translation had a 1082 million negative impact on our total revenue and a 979 million positive impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were charges of 44 million and 15 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements as of december 31 2012 and 2011 we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2012 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

  

    

   

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 100 on our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2012 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 79 million on pretax income and a decrease of 79 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2012 

  

based upon information from thirdparty banks the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately 16 billion at december 31 2012 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 6625 senior notes and 11625 senior subordinated notes were 3850 million and 4888 million respectively at december 31 2012 

  

in march 2011 we entered into five interest rate swap agreements all with effective dates in october 2011 and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with topic 815 the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities the total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is 4000 million with 2000 million expiring in october 2017 and 2000 million expiring in september 2019 there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 as of december 31 2012 the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a 480 million liability and were included in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

we also have 3260 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2012 these notes have interest rates ranging from 246 to 875 with maturity dates extending through 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 100 our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 17 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant 

  

we also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

company overview 

  

cbre group inc a delaware corporation formerly known as cb richard ellis group inc which may be referred to in this form 10k as the “company” “we” “us” and “our” is the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2011 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2011 we operated more than 300 offices worldwide excluding affiliate offices with approximately 34000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cbre” brand name investment management services under the “cbre global investors” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research we generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis our contractual feeforservices businesses which generally involve facilities management property management mortgage loan servicing and investment management represented approximately 39 of our 2011 revenue 

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 we generated revenue from a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients that includes approximately 80 of the fortune 100 companies we estimate that the following client types accounted for the highest proportion of revenue in 2011 

  

   

   

   

the following client types accounted for the remainder of our revenue 

  

   

   

   

   

property owners occupiers and investors continue to consolidate their service needs with fewer providers and are awarding their business to firms that have strong capabilities in leading markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing and disproportionate share of the business being awarded as a result of these trends 

  

in 2011 we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the fortune most admired companies and achieved the highest brand reputation ranking among all commercial real estate companies in a survey of wall street journal subscribers since 2006 we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 in every year since 2008 we have been the only commercial real estate services firm to be included in the fortune 500  additionally the international association of outsourcing professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for five consecutive years including in 2011 when we ranked 6th overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company 

  

cbre history 

  

cbre marked its 105 th year of continuous operations in 2011 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake since then we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services firm in terms of 2011 revenue through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions including the december 2006 purchase of trammell crow company which significantly deepened our outsourcing service offerings and the 2011 reim acquisitions described below 

  

in 2011 we completed a series of strategic transactions with netherlandsbased ing group nv and its affiliates ing which bolstered our global real estate investment management business we acquired substantially all of ing’s real estate investment management reim operations in europe and asia and its usbased global real estate listed securities business clarion real estate securities cres for over 810 million in cash which we refer to as the reim acquisitions in addition we acquired coinvestment interests totaling approximately 80 million 

  

these former ing businesses are now part of our independently operated global investment management segment which conducts business through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre global investors the reim and cres businesses are highly complementary with little overlap in client base and different investment strategies cbre global investors has traditionally focused on valueadd funds and separate accounts the reim and cres businesses have primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds except in asia where reim manages valueadd and opportunistic funds the combined entity provides us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies as of december 31 2011 cbre global investors’ assets under management or aum totaled 941 billion which includes aum acquired in the reim acquisitions 

  

the reim acquisitions were completed during 2011 as follows 

 

   

we have also historically enhanced and complemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialtyniche firms that are leaders in their areas of concentration or in their local markets including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships these “infill” acquisitions remain an integral part of our longterm strategy cbre group inc formerly cb richard ellis group inc was incorporated on february 20 2001 and changed its name to cbre group inc effective october 3 2011 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

cbre group inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries cbre services inc our direct whollyowned subsidiary is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness 

  

we report our operations through the following segments 1 americas 2 europe middle east and africa or emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services

the americas 

  

the americas is our largest business segment comprised of operations throughout the united states and canada as well as key markets in latin america our operations are largely whollyowned but also include independent affiliated offices which license the use of the “cbre” and “cb richard ellis” names in their local markets in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us and an agreement to crossrefer business between us and the affiliate 

  

most of our operations are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre inc our mortgage loan origination sales and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary operating under the name cbre capital markets and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre limited both cbre capital markets and cbre limited are subsidiaries of cbre inc 

  

our americas segment accounted for 622 of our 2011 revenue 629 of our 2010 revenue and 623 of our 2009 revenue within our americas segment we organize our services into the following business areas 

  

advisory services

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms including professional development and training market research and information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through our commercial real estate market information and forecasting unit cbre econometric advisors cbreea this group provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including market outlook reports for the office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering more than 125 metropolitan areas in the united states and canada

outsourcing services 

  

outsourcing commercial real estate services is a longterm trend in our industry with corporations institutions public sector entities health care providers and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of thirdparty real estate specialists our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend 1 corporate services and 2 asset services agreements with our corporate services clients are generally longterm arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination there are usually penalties for early termination although our management agreements with our asset services clients generally may be terminated with notice ranging between 30 to 90 days we have developed longterm relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships as of december 31 2011 we managed approximately 14 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the americas our outsourcing services business line accounted for 277 of our 2011 consolidated worldwide revenue 279 of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue and 315 of our 2009 consolidated worldwide revenue

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research each business discipline is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2011 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face 

  

competition from other commercial real estate service providers including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield and jones lang lasalle as well as national firms such as grubb  ellis 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2011 we had approximately 34000 employees worldwide excluding affiliate offices approximately 40 of which are in our outsourcing business and are fully reimbursed by our clients at december 31 2011 771 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business in new york new jersey illinois and california we believe that relations with our employees are generally good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cbre” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cbre” “cb richard ellis” and “trammell crow” names with respect to the cbre and cb richard ellis names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cbre and cb richard ellis related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cbre and cb richard ellis related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them

federal state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we do business impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos or lead at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property further federal state and local governments in the countries in which we do business have begun enacting various laws regulations and treaties governing environmental and climate change particularly for “greenhouse gases” which seek to tax penalize or limit the release of those “greenhouse gases” such regulations could lead to increased operational or compliance costs over time 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the most significant risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business could be harmed by an economic slowdown and downturn in commercial real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates declining employment levels declining demand for commercial real estate falling real estate values or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines these economic conditions can result in a general decline in acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of commercial real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing as well as revenues associated with development activities in addition we could experience a reduction in the amount of fees we earn in our global investment management business if our assets under management decrease or those assets fail to perform as anticipated these conditions can lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development 

  

our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets during an economic downturn investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our commercial real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

performance of our asset services line of business partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage because our fees are generally based on a percentage of aggregate rent collections from these properties the performance of these properties may be impacted by many factors which are partially or completely outside of our control including i real estate and financial market conditions prevailing generally and locally ii our ability to attract and retain creditworthy tenants particularly during economic downturns and iii the magnitude of defaults by tenants under their respective leases which may increase during distressed conditions 

  

during 2008 and 2009 credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession these adverse macro conditions impacted real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations similar to other commercial real estate services firms our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009 and as a result our stock price declined significantly if the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate 

  

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our 

  

global investment management and development services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

in 2008 and 2009 the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude this disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding in some cases these sources were eliminated while the credit market has shown signs of improving since the second half of 2009 liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy this uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to total interest expense of 225x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 375x our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot give assurance that we will be able to meet those ratios when required for example we experienced a decline in ebitda during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009 which negatively impacted our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio however we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009 and as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business we are well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 150x for the year ended december 31 2011 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 153x as of december 31 2011 we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding 

  

borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain nonus subsidiaries in addition in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations we established new term loans totaling approximately 8000 million under our credit agreement in 2011 to finance the reim acquisitions as of december 31 2011 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit both of which are generally nonrecourse to us was approximately 25 billion for the year ended december 31 2011 our interest expense was approximately 1502 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase if we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement our debt service obligations may be substantially increased 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

from time to time moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future as well as the interest rates and 

  

other terms of any future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our class a common stock in addition to our outstanding debt instruments 

  

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which if accomplished may adversely impact our stock price 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre capital markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

if we experience defaults by multiple clients or counterparties it could adversely affect our business 

  

we could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients or counterparties if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

any of our clients may experience a downturn in their business that may weaken their results of operations and financial condition as a result a client may fail to make payments when due become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any client bankruptcy or insolvency or the failure of any client to make payments when due could result in material losses to our company a client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us additionally certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients if such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client 

  

the bankruptcy or insolvency of a significant counterparty which may include cobrokers lenders insurance companies hedging counterparties service providers or other organizations with which we do business or the failure of any significant counterparty to perform its contractual commitments may result in disruption to our business or material losses to our company 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations stockholders’ equity and our stock price for example due to the severe market downturn and credit crisis we determined in december 2008 that the negative impact of the global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as a result we incurred charges of 12 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2008 a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including brett white our chief executive officer mr white and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant amount of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees including those acquired through acquisitions or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel we use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize our key personnel any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2011 we generated approximately 41 of our revenue from operations outside the united states with the reim acquisitions the footprint of our global investment management business has significantly expanded particularly in europe and asia additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we maintain anticorruption and antimoney laundering compliance programs throughout the company violations of our compliance programs may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material 

  

monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2011 approximately 41 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese yuan the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee with the closing of the reim acquisitions our global investment management business now has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which has seen a developing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a notable drop in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our assets under management revenue and earnings 

  

over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar and the euro relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar and the euro may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies there can be no assurance that these hedging instruments will be available when needed additionally economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future or perform as expected 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of the trammell crow company in december 2006 and the reim acquisitions that we completed in the second half of 2011 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase in addition acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other 

  

business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels as with prior material transactions we expect to incur significant integration expenses associated with the reim acquisitions in 2012 and beyond 

  

the anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions may not be realized as we contemplated 

  

we completed the reim acquisitions with the expectation that such acquisitions would result in various benefits including among others enhanced revenues and margins a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties including whether we successfully integrate the business being acquired achieve expected synergies and realize accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our financial condition and operating results 

  

our revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business can vary significantly as a result of market developments 

  

with the completion of the reim acquisitions our global investment management business has significantly increased and become more globally diverse with the addition of the reim funds a substantial part of our fees are more recurring in nature however the revenue net income and cash flow generated by our global investment management business are all somewhat variable primarily due to the fact that management transaction and incentive fees can vary as a result of market movements from one period to another 

  

the pace at which the real estate markets worldwide turned from positive to negative starting in 2007 and continuing into 2009 is an example of the market volatility to which we are subject and over which we have no control the underlying market conditions decisions regarding the acquisition and disposition of fund and separate account assets and the specifics of client mandates will cause the amount of asset management transaction and incentive fees to vary from one product to another 

  

a substantial part of our fees are based upon the value of the assets we manage and if asset values deteriorate our asset management fees will decline as a result our acquisition and disposition fees can decline as a result of delay in the deployment of capital or limited market liquidity we also earn incentive fees tied to portfolio performance which fees may decline if there is a downturn in real estate markets and we fail to meet benchmarks or absolute return hurdles finally during periods of economic weakness or recession existing and prospective clients in our global investment management business may be less able or willing to commit new funds to real estate investments which are inherently less liquid than many competing investment classes thereby inhibiting the ability of our global investment management business to raise new funds additionally investors with open commitments to provide additional investment could become less able or willing to honor their financial commitments and seek to renegotiate the terms of their commitments or the fees that they are obligated to pay to the extent that clients in our global investment management business seek to avoid paying fees they are obligated to pay or seek to avoid deploying capital that has been committed we could experience a rapid decrease in collection of fees and interruptions to our client relationships and business 

  

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments 

  

as of december 31 2011 we had committed 594 million to fund future coinvestments all of which is expected to be funded during 2012 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is a very important part of our global investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 45 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 269 million and 136 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us in addition to being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable in addition at december 31 2011 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 45 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 523 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 144 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 14 million excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

  

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintain our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

  

we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions 

  

the advice we render in our financial advisory business and the investment decisions we make in our global investment management business and the activities of our investment banking and investment management professionals for or on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation such litigation may arise from client or investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs and a variety of other litigation claims including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment discretion control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients 

  

to the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct investors may have remedies against us our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law moreover we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed 

  

some of these litigation risks may be mitigated by our selfinsurance programs or by the commercial insurance we maintain in amounts we believe are appropriate however in the event of a substantial loss our insurance coverage andor selfinsurance reserve levels might not be sufficient to pay the full damages further the value of otherwise valid claims we hold under insurance policies could become uncollectible in the event of the covering insurance company’s insolvency although we seek to limit this risk by placing our commercial insurance only with highlyrated companies any of these events could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business as well as investors for our global investment management business as a result allegations by private litigants or regulators of conflicts of interest or improper conduct by us whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities whether or not valid may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our global investment management business and our other global businesses in addition if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us which could materially impact our business 

  

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2011 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of these firms may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours in general there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed due to the ongoing economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2011 approximately 10 of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california the economic downturns in the california commercial real estate market and particularly in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could cause an adverse effect on our results 

  

we operate in many jurisdictions with complex and varied tax regimes and are subject to different forms of taxation resulting in a variable effective tax rate in addition from time to time we engage in transactions that involve different tax jurisdictions due to the different tax laws in the many jurisdictions where we operate we are often required to make subjective determinations the tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we carry on business may not agree with the determinations that are made by us with respect to the application of tax law such disagreements could result in disputes and ultimately in the payment of additional funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in addition changes in tax rules or the outcome of tax assessments and audits could have an adverse effect on our results in any particular quarter 

  

our estimate of tax related assets liabilities recoveries and expenses incorporates assumptions these assumptions include but are not limited to the tax laws in various jurisdictions the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions taxable income projections and the benefits of various restructuring plans to the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities 

  

we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies arising out of tax claims assessments related to uncertain tax positions and provisions for specifically identified income tax exposures there are currently tax audits ongoing in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate there can be no assurance that we will be successful in resolving potential tax claims that arise from these audits we have recorded provisions on the basis of the best current understanding however we could be required to book additional provisions in future periods 

  

for amounts that cannot be assessed at this stage our failure to do so andor the need to increase our provisions for such claims could have an adverse effect on our financial position 

  

if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans are not sufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make cash contributions to it and our liquidity may be adversely affected 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets which are incorporated herein by reference was 609 million and 400 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively if the assets in our defined benefit pension plans continue to be insufficient to meet the plans’ obligations we may be required to make substantial cash contributions preventing the use of such cash for other purposes and adversely affecting our liquidity 

  

if we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties 

  

our business depends in part on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property such as our service marks client lists and information business methods and research existing laws or the application of those laws of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and on patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims may harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services 

  

confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices such as laptop computers which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted

business both within and outside of the united states also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance or prevent us from providing certain types of services in connection with certain transactions or clients 

 

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2011 

 

   

some of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segments also contain employees of our other business segments often the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices we have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our global investment management and development services offices to avoid double counting 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business our management believes that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued arising from such lawsuits are remote but that litigation is inherently uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount in excess of that anticipated by management

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2011 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2011 we operated more than 300 offices worldwide excluding affiliate offices with approximately 34000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cbre” brand name investment management services under the “cbre global investors” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management occupier and propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research we generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a perproject or transactional basis since 2006 we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 in every year since 2008 we have been the only commercial real estate services firm to be included in the fortune 500  additionally the international association of outsourcing professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for five consecutive years including in 2011 when we ranked 6th overall and were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company in 2011 we were the highest ranked commercial real estate services company among the fortune most admired companies and achieved the highest brand reputation ranking among all commercial real estate companies in a survey of wall street journal subscribers 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates declining employment levels decreasing demand for real estate falling real estate values or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of some or all of our business lines from late 2007 through 2009 the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations by depressing transaction activity decreasing occupancy and rental rates sharply lowering property values and restraining corporate spending these trends in turn adversely affected our revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing and funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets these negative trends began to reverse in 2010 and 2011 as commercial real estate markets improved in step with the stabilization and recovery of global economic activity 

  

weak economic conditions from late 2007 through 2009 also affected our compensation expense which is structured to generally decrease in line with a fall in revenue compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition at times when negative economic conditions are particularly severe as they were in 2008 and 2009 our management has moved decisively to improve operational performance by lowering operating expenses through such actions as reducing discretionary bonuses curtailing capital expenditures and adjusting overall staffing levels among others as general economic conditions and our performance improved we began 

  

to restore certain of these expenses in 2010 and 2011 notwithstanding the ongoing market recovery a return of adverse global and regional economic trends remains one of the most significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition 

  

economic conditions first began to negatively affect our performance in the americas our largest segment in terms of revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2007 the effects became more severe as the decline in economic activity particularly in the united states accelerated throughout 2008 and most of 2009 the global capital markets disruption in late 2008 in particular caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales leasing financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and to improve later that year following a return to positive economic growth in the united states the recovery continued at a slow pace in 2011 as vacancy rates dipped moderately rental rates stabilized or edged up slightly credit became more readily available and property sales and leasing activity increased however market activity has remained well below levels experienced in 2006 and 2007 

  

in europe weakening market conditions first began to manifest in the united kingdom in late 2007 and in countries on the continent in early 2008 the major european economies also fell into recession in 2008 which deepened and persisted through 2009 economic activity improved in 2010 but began to wane again in the second half of 2011 due to the effects of the european sovereign debt crisis as a result economic growth in europe lagged behind other parts of the world in 2011 while rents essentially remained flat in 2011 leasing velocity slowed in many major markets in europe investment sales in europe were adversely affected by the financial crisis in late 2008 and most of 2009 larger markets like london and paris showed strong increases in investment sales starting in late 2009 but activity reached a plateau across most of europe in 2011 

  

real estate markets in asia pacific were also affected though generally to a lesser degree than in the united states and europe by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn this resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in the region in 2008 and most of 2009 transaction activity revived significantly in late 2009 reflecting strong economic growth and improved through 2010 and most of 2011 however the improvement began to slow in the later stages of 2011 due to heightened concerns about how the european sovereign debt crisis and tepid us economic growth would affect the region’s economies 

  

beginning in late 2007 deteriorating conditions also adversely affected real estate investment management and property development activity as property values declined sharply and both financing and disposal options became more limited however market conditions for these businesses improved as financing and investment sales markets recovered in late 2010 and 2011 

  

the further recovery of our global sales leasing investment management and development services operations depends on continued improvement in market fundamentals including solid economic growth and sustained strong job growth stable and healthy global credit markets and increased business and investor confidence 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world in december 2006 we acquired the trammell crow company the trammell crow company acquisition our largest acquisition to date which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

on february 15 2011 we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing group nv ing for approximately 940 million in cash the acquisitions included substantially all of ing’s real estate investment management reim operations in europe and asia as well as substantially all of clarion real estate securities cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business collectively referred to as ing reim on february 15 2011 we also announced that we expected to acquire approximately 55 million of cres coinvestments from ing and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia upon completion of the acquisitions which we refer to as the reim acquisitions ing reim became part of our global investment management segment which conducts business through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre global investors an independently operated business segment the ing transaction is highly complementary with little overlap in client base and different investment strategies cbre global investors has traditionally focused on valueadd funds and separate accounts ing reim has primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds except in asia where ing reim manages valueadd and opportunistic funds the combined entity provides us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies 

  

on july 1 2011 we completed the acquisition of cres for 3239 million and cres coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 586 million on october 3 2011 we completed the acquisition of ing reim asia for 456 million and three ing reim asia coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 139 million on october 31 2011 we completed the acquisition of ing reim europe for 4425 million and one coinvestment from ing for 74 million our initial estimate of 940 million in total purchase price for the reim acquisitions has been reduced by approximately 47 million for certain fund and separate account management contracts that were not acquired and for certain balance sheet adjustments there is a possibility of an additional closing of approximately 80 million and coinvestments of up to 68 million in the future related to our acquisition of ing reim europe 

  

as of december 31 2011 cbre global investors’ assets under management or aum totaled 941 billion which includes aum acquired in the reim acquisitions aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide or participate in oversight investment management services and other advice and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market not the basis for determining our management fees our material assets under management consist of 

  

   

   

our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings from 2005 to 2008 we completed 58 infill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 592 million because of the economic downturn no acquisitions 

  

were completed in 2009 and 2010 except for a small niche industrial practice in the united kingdom acquired in the second quarter of 2010 and a small commercial property asset management and consultancy services firm in hong kong acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010 during the year ended december 31 2011 we completed five infill acquisitions including a valuation business in australia a retail property management business in central and eastern europe our former affiliate company in switzerland a retail services business in the united kingdom and a shopping center management business in the netherlands the companies we acquired have generally been quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which in some cases we held an equity interest as market conditions continue to improve we believe acquisitions may once again serve as a growth engine supplementing our organic growth 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures which include severance lease termination transaction and deferred financing costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example through december 31 2011 we incurred 2589 million of transactionrelated expenditures and integration costs in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 in addition through december 31 2011 we incurred 702 million of transactionrelated expenditures and integration costs in connection with the reim acquisitions as with prior material acquisitions we anticipate incurring significant integration expenses associated with the reim acquisitions in 2012 and beyond we expect the total pretax transaction costs relating to the reim acquisitions including retention and integration costs to be approximately 150 million 

  

international operations 

  

as we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars 

  

with the closing of the reim acquisitions our global investment management business now has a significant amount of eurodenominated assets under management as well as associated revenue and earnings in europe which has seen a developing crisis in sovereign debt resulting in a significant drop in the value of the euro against the us dollar fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our aum revenue and earnings 

  

due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar and euro may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2011 our total debt excluding our notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit both of which are generally nonrecourse to us was approximately 25 billion 

  

our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place constraints on the operation of our business although our management believes that longterm indebtedness has been an important lever in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisition of trammell crow company and the reim acquisitions the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue there are four basic criteria that must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord with the remaining portions of the lease commission earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent the existence of any significant future 

  

contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements 

  

investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees which are commonly referred to as carried interest this carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period in addition our global investment management segment also earns successbased transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on certain funds and separate accounts such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision 

  

we earn development and incentive development fees in our development services segment development fees are generally based on a percentage of a defined cost measure and are recognized at the lower of the amount billed or the amount determined on a straightline basis over the development period incentive development fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectability our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our vies including coinvestments with our clients is based on accounting standards update or asu 200917 “ consolidations topic 810 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities ” this asu incorporates statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 167 “ amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r ” issued by the financial accounting standards board or fasb in june 2009 the amendments in this asu replace the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity if any has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with a primarily qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both 1 the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity the entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary 

  

we analyze any investments in vies to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance including but not limited to the ability to direct financing leasing construction and other operating decisions and activities in addition we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity 

  

we also have several coinvestments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the newer qualitative approach for analyzing potential vies we continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary see note 4 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any as well as disclose our maximum exposure to loss related to vies that are not consolidated we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

if an entity is not a vie our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to remove the general partner with or without cause or to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt 

  

under either the equity or cost method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value when testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments andor look to comparable activities in the marketplace management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach these assumptions include net asset values internal rates of return discount and capitalization rates interest rates and financing terms rental rates timing of leasing activity estimates of lease terms and related concessions etc when determining if impairment is otherthantemporary we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and nearterm prospects of each investment 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cbre services inc or cbre in 2001 the 2001 acquisition our acquisition of insignia financial group inc or insignia in 2003 the insignia 

  

acquisition the trammell crow company acquisition in 2006 and the reim acquisitions in 2011 other intangible assets that have indefinite estimated useful lives and are not being amortized include certain management contracts identified in the reim acquisitions a trademark which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as trade names separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition and reim acquisitions the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts and loan servicing rights which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year when we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1 2011 2010 and 2009 we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value after recording significant impairments during the year ended december 31 2008 as described in prior disclosures 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2011 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 4601 million 64 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation cost capitalization and allocation disposition of real estate and discontinued operations 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets the “ property plant and equipment ” topic of fasb accounting standards codification or asc or topic 360 establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of topic 360’s “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the “held for sale” criteria 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows management estimates or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally up to 39 years tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives up to 15 years 

  

when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons impairment charges of 17 million 246 million and 288 million were recorded for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively in addition during the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of 26 million 23 million and 39 million respectively 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under topic 360 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment had we evaluated our assets differently the balance sheet classification of such assets depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize costs capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy which are timing decisions that require judgment costs capitalized include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance interest development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations we do not capitalize any internal costs when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the “ business combinations ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 805 pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made a difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values where practicable or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land land improvements building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow 

  

model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense if we use different estimates in these valuations the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements 

  

disposition of real estate 

  

gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project we evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method this evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated the adequacy of the buyer’s investment the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer with no substantial continuing involvement by us if the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer’s investment and our continuing involvement in some cases a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition 

  

discontinued operations 

  

topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction as defined in topic 360 a “component of an entity” comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary many constitute a component of an entity under topic 360 increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur the evaluation of whether the component’s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for 

  

deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2011 and 2010 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report for further information regarding income taxes 

  

unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside the united states which have been or are intended to be permanently invested aggregated approximately 11 billion at december 31 2011 presently we have not recorded an associated deferred tax liability these earnings may become taxable upon a payment of a dividend or as a result of a sale or liquidation of the subsidiaries at this time we do not have any plans to repatriate income from our foreign subsidiaries however to the extent that we are able to repatriate such earnings in a tax efficient manner or in the event of a change in our capital situation or investment strategy that such funds became needed for funding our us operations we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes to repatriate these funds cash and cash equivalents owned by nonus subsidiaries totaled 2103 million at december 31 2011 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

   

 

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization while amounts shown for ebitda as adjusted remove the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions cost containment and asset impairments our management believes that both of these measures are useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculations of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted generally eliminate the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses these measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs additionally we believe ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are useful to investors to assist them in getting a more complete picture of our results from operations 

  

however ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not recognized measurements under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda and ebitda as adjusted in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda and ebitda as adjusted may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda and ebitda as adjusted are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda and ebitda as adjusted also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda and ebitda as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows 

 

  

   

     

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 2392 million for the year ended december 31 2011 on revenue of 59 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 2003 million on revenue of 51 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2011 increased by 7901 million or 154 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide sales up 242 leasing up 95 and outsourcing up 150 activity also contributing to the increase was revenue of 846 million attributable to the reim acquisitions in the current year foreign currency translation had a 1438 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2011 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 4970 million or 168 during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission basis which substantially correlates with our transaction revenue performance accordingly the increase in transaction revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission accruals higher salaries and related costs associated with our global property and facilities management contracts also contributed to the increase in cost of services in the current year additionally included in cost of services for the year ended december 31 2011 were cost containment expenses of 200 million relating to severance costs incurred to calibrate our staffing levels to the current market environment foreign currency translation had an 817 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2011 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 585 for the year ended december 31 2011 from 579 for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily driven by higher commission tranches achieved in the current year as a result of the increased transaction revenue and the aforementioned cost containment expenses 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 2750 million or 171 during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the increase was primarily driven by higher payrollrelated costs including bonuses which resulted from our improved operating performance and the reim acquisitions operating expenses for the year ended december 31 2011 also included 667 million of transaction and integration costs incurred in connection with the reim acquisitions foreign currency translation had a 442 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2011 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 319 for the year ended december 31 2011 from 314 for the year ended december 31 2010 primarily driven by the aforementioned costs incurred relative to the reim acquisitions 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 73 million or 68 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the reim acquisitions and other infill acquisitions completed in the current year the increase in amortization expense was partially offset by lower depreciation expense partially stemming from property dispositions in our global investment management and development services segments in the current year 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was 130 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 73 million for the year ended december 31 2010 these gains primarily resulted from activity within our development services segment 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 782 million or 2945 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our development services segment in the current year also contributing to the increase were lower impairment charges reported by our global investment management segment in the current year 

  

our other income on a consolidated basis was 27 million for the year ended december 31 2011 and was reported within our global investment management segment this income primarily represented net realized and unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities which we acquired in our acquisition of cres in the current year 

  

our consolidated interest income increased by 10 million or 122 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was mainly driven by higher interest income reported in our americas segment in the current year 

  

our consolidated interest expense decreased by 409 million or 214 during the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to the year ended december 31 2010 the decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement due to debt repayments made in the second half of 2010 and lower interest rates resulting from our refinancing activities in the fourth quarter of 2010 the lower interest expense more than offset the increase in interest expense attributable to additional borrowings made to finance the reim acquisitions and the new british pound sterling a1 term loan facility entered into in the current year this overall net decrease was also partially offset by interest expense incurred related to the 3500 million of 6625 senior notes issued on october 8 2010 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 1891 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 1304 million for the year ended december 31 2010 our effective tax rate from continuing operations after adjusting pretax income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests increased to 448 for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 405 for the year ended december 31 2010 the changes in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of a significant increase in income reported in the current year and a change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings losses in addition certain of the transaction costs incurred in connection with the reim acquisitions in the current year were nondeductible 

  

our consolidated income from discontinued operations net of income taxes was 499 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 143 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the income in the current year was reported in our global investment management and development services segments and mostly related to gains from property sales which were largely attributable to noncontrolling interests the income in the prior year was reported in our development services segment and mostly related to gains from property sales 

  

our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on a consolidated basis was 512 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests of 443 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this activity primarily reflects our noncontrolling interests’ share of income and losses within our global investment management and development services segments 

  

year ended december 31 2010 compared to year ended december 31 2009 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 2003 million for the year ended december 31 2010 on revenue of 51 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 333 million on revenue of 42 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2010 increased by 9495 million or 228 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was primarily driven by higher 

  

worldwide sales up 515 leasing up 293 and outsourcing up 85 activity foreign currency translation had a 441 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2010 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 5123 million or 209 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the increase in revenue led to a corresponding increase in commission and bonus accruals in addition commission reinstatements contributed to the increase higher salaries and related costs associated with our property and facilities management contracts also contributed to an increase in cost of services in 2010 foreign currency translation had a 310 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2010 cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased from 588 for the year ended december 31 2009 to 579 for the year ended december 31 2010 this decrease was primarily the result of the strong improvement in overall revenue and a shift in the mix of revenue with transaction revenue comprising a greater portion of the total than in 2009 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by 2241 million or 162 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily driven by higher payrollrelated costs including bonuses which resulted from our improved operating performance as well as the restoration of salaries to prerecession levels in the third quarter of 2010 and substantially restored bonus target levels in the fourth quarter of 2010 also contributing to the increase was higher carried interest incentive compensation expense accruals and increased marketing and travel costs in support of our growing revenue in 2010 foreign currency translation had a 108 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2010 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 314 for the year ended december 31 2010 from 332 for the year ended december 31 2009 reflective of our cost containment efforts during the recessionary period of 2008 and 2009 as well as the strong improvement in overall revenue 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 89 million or 90 for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense within our global investment management segment driven by the consolidation of several assets due to the adoption of asu 200917 in 2010 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was 73 million and 70 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively these gains resulted from activity within our development services segment 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis was 266 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to an equity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries of 341 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase in equity income in 2010 was primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales within our development services segment and higher equity earnings in our global investment management segment largely resulting from a fund liquidation also contributing to the variance were lower impairment charges associated with equity investments in our development services and global investment management segments in 2010 

  

our consolidated interest income was 84 million for the year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 23 million or 373 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was mainly driven by higher interest income reported in our asia pacific segment which resulted from the final measurement of a deferred purchase obligation related to the purchase of remaining noncontrolling interests in our subsidiary in india 

  

our consolidated interest expense increased by 20 million or 11 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher interest 

  

expense associated with the 4500 million of 11625 senior subordinated notes issued in june 2009 and increased interest expense reported by our global investment management segment mainly resulting from the consolidation of several assets due to the adoption of asu 200917 in 2010 these increases were largely offset by lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement 

  

we wrote off 181 million and 293 million of financing costs during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively in connection with the new credit agreement we entered into on november 10 2010 we wrote off financing costs of 167 million during the year ended december 31 2010 in addition in october 2010 we wrote off 14 million of unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with debt repayments made in connection with the march 24 2009 amendment and restatement of our previous credit agreement we wrote off financing costs of 293 million during the year ended december 31 2009

our consolidated income from discontinued operations net of income taxes was 143 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this income was reported in our development services segment and mostly related to gains from asset dispositions 

  

our net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on a consolidated basis was 443 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 610 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this activity primarily reflects our noncontrolling interests’ share of losses within our global investment management and development services segments 

  

segment operations 

  

we report our operations through the following segments 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services the americas consists of operations located in the united states canada and key markets in latin america emea mainly consists of operations in europe while asia pacific includes operations in asia australia and new zealand the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in north america europe and asia the development services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses and operating income loss by our americas emea asia pacific global investment management and development services operating segments for the years ended december 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

  

   

    

year ended december 31 2011 compared to year ended december 31 2010 

  

americas

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2012 include up to 170 million of anticipated net capital expenditures including requirements associated with the reim acquisitions as of december 31 2011 we had committed to fund 144 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time additionally as of december 31 2011 we had aggregate commitments of 594 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business all of which is expected to be funded in 2012 in recent years the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future 

  

on february 15 2011 we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing for approximately 940 million in cash the acquisitions included substantially all of the ing reim operations in europe and asia as well as substantially all of cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business on february 15 2011 we also announced that we expected to acquire approximately 55 million of cres coinvestments from ing and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia on july 1 2011 we acquired cres for 3239 million and cres coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 586 million using borrowings from our tranche d term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions on october 3 2011 we acquired ing reim’s operations in asia for 456 million and three ing reim asia coinvestments from ing for an aggregate amount of 139 million using borrowings from our tranche c term loan facility under our credit agreement to finance these transactions on october 31 2011 we completed the ing reim europe portion of the reim acquisitions acquiring ing reim’s operations in europe for 4425 million and one coinvestment from ing for 74 million using borrowings from our tranche c term loan facility under our credit agreement cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to finance these transactions our initial estimate of 940 million in total purchase price for the reim acquisitions has been reduced by approximately 47 million for certain fund and separate account management contracts that were not acquired and for certain balance sheet adjustments there is a possibility of an additional closing of approximately 80 million and coinvestments of up to 68 million in the future related to our acquisition of ing reim europe 

  

during 2003 and 2006 we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company in the past two years we also conducted two debt offerings the first in 2009 was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession and the second in 2010 was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009 we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary events our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms or at all in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of two elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness we are unable to project with certainty whether our 

  

longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if our cash flow is insufficient then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates we cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the united kingdom our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall during 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 609 million and 400 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 52 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2012

offbalance sheet arrangements

we had guarantees totaling 437 million as of december 31 2011 excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet and operating leases the 437 million primarily consists of guarantees related to our defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom in excess of our outstanding pension liability of 609 million as of december 31 2011 which are continuous guarantees that will not expire until all amounts have been paid out for our pension liabilities the remainder of the guarantees mainly represent guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries which expire at varying dates through november 2013 as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements 

  

in addition as of december 31 2011 we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects these guarantees are made by us in the ordinary course of our development services business each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget however we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees these contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 

  

from time to time we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects we do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business in connection with these activities we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects although we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect and also look to insurance policies that cover this work while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects 

  

in january 2008 cbre multifamily capital inc or cbre mci a whollyowned subsidiary of cbre capital markets inc entered into an agreement with fannie mae under fannie mae’s delegated underwriting and servicing lender program or dus program to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units under the dus program cbre mci originates underwrites closes and services loans without prior approval by fannie mae and in selected cases is subject to sharing up to onethird of any losses on loans originated under the dus program cbre mci has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of 35 billion at december 31 2011 additionally cbre mci has funded loans under the dus program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately 5181 million at december 31 2011 cbre mci under its agreement with fannie mae must post cash reserves under formulas established by fannie mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur as of december 31 2011 and 2010 cbre mci had 46 million and 22 million respectively of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement and had provided approximately 64 million and 40 million respectively of loan loss accruals fannie mae’s recourse under the dus program is limited to the assets of cbre mci which totaled approximately 1806 million including 1066 million of warehouse receivables a substantial majority of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to fannie mae at december 31 2011 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 20 to 

  

50 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2011 we had aggregate commitments of 594 million to fund future coinvestments all of which is expected to be funded in 2012 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2011 we had committed to fund 144 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries which may be called at any time 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2010 the fasb issued asu 201029 “ business combinations topic 805 disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations ” asu 201029 specifies that when a public company completes a business combination the company should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period the update also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures under topic 805 to include a description of the nature and amount of material nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the pro forma revenue and earnings the requirements of asu 201029 are effective for business combinations that occur on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december 15 2010 we adopted this asu during the year ended december 31 2011 see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report and do not believe the adoption of this update had a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements 

  

in april 2011 the fasb issued asu 201103 “ transfers and servicing topic 860 reconsideration of effective control for repurchase agreements ” asu 201103 specifies when an entity may or may not recognize a sale upon the transfer of financial assets subject to repurchase agreements that determination is based in part on whether the entity has maintained effective control over the transferred financial assets the requirements of asu 201103 will be effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after december 15 2011 with early adoption prohibited we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in may 2011 the fasb issued asu 201104 “ fair value measurement topic 820 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss ” these amendments were issued to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value 

  

measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between gaap and international financial reporting standards or ifrs asu 201104 changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level 3 fair value measurements this asu is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption prohibited we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2011 the fasb issued asu 201105 “ comprehensive income topic 220 presentation of comprehensive income ” this asu eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201112 “ comprehensive income topic 220 deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 201105 ” this asu defers indefinitely certain requirements from asu 201105 that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 201105 and asu 201112 are effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted and requires retrospective application for all periods presented we elected to adopt these asus early and have provided the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements in the consolidated financial statements set forth in item 8 of this annual report we do not believe the adoption of these updates had a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements 

  

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu 201108 “ intangiblesgoodwill and other topic 350  testing goodwill for impairment ” this asu gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment to first assess whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary asu 201108 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 with early adoption permitted we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201110 “ property plant and equipment topic 360 derecognition of in substance real estate—a scope clarification” this asu requires that a reporting entity that ceases to have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary that is in substance real estate as a result of default on the subsidiary’s nonrecourse debt would apply fasb asc subtopic 36020 property plant and equipment—real estate sales  to determine whether to derecognize assets and liabilities of that subsidiary asu 201110 is effective prospectively for a deconsolidation event that takes place in fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june 15 2012 we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2011 the fasb issued asu 201111 “ balance sheet topic 210 disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities” this asu adds certain additional disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements asu 201111 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after january 1 2013 with retrospective application required we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on the disclosure requirements for our consolidated financial statements 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations we manage such risk primarily by managing the amount sources and duration of our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb 

  

accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for derivative financial instruments in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2011 approximately 41 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the chinese yuan the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2011 foreign currency translation had a 1438 million positive impact on our total revenue and a 1259 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in item 8 of this annual report were charges of 15 million and 10 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements as of december 31 2011 and 2010 we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2011 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

 

  

     

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 100 on our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2011 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 78 million on pretax income and a decrease of 78 million on cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2011 

  

based upon information from thirdparty banks the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately 17 billion at december 31 2011 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 6625 senior notes and 11625 senior subordinated notes were 3649 million and 5043 million respectively at december 31 2011 

  

in march 2011 we entered into five interest rate swap agreements all with effective dates in october 2011 and immediately designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with topic 815 the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities the total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is 4000 million with 2000 million expiring in october 2017 and 2000 million expiring in september 2019 there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended december 31 2011 as of december 31 2011 the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as a 399 million liability and were included in other longterm liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in item 8 of this annual report 

  

we also have 3729 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2011 these notes have interest rates ranging from 185 to 875 with maturity dates extending through 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 100 our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 19 million for the year ended december 31 2011 from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant 

  

we also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission we acquired certain real estate investment management businesses from ing group nv during 2011 “acquired business” as defined in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and we excluded from our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 the acquired business’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of 14 billion and total revenues of 846 million included in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december 31 2011 based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2011 the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2011 has been audited by kpmg llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

cb richard ellis history 

  

cb richard ellis marked its 104 th year of continuous operations in 2010 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake from those humble beginnings we have grown into the largest global commercial real estate services firm in terms of 2010 revenue through organic growth and a series of strategic acquisitions in the united states and the united kingdom in december 2006 we completed the acquisition of trammell crow company our largest acquisition to date which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management solutions across geographies and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

on february 15 2011 we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing group nv ing for approximately 940 million in cash the acquisitions include substantially all of the ing real estate investment 

  

management operations in europe and asia as well as clarion real estate securities cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business collectively ing reim the ing reim operations being acquired are expected to become part of our global investment management segment whose business is conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre investors which will continue to be an independently operated business segment upon completion of the acquisitions cbre investors has primarily focused on valueadd funds and separate accounts ing reim has primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds except in asia where ing reim manages valueadd funds and opportunity funds there is expected to be little overlap in the companies’ client bases with a majority of cbre investors’ clients being usbased and a majority of ing reim’s clients based in europe we also expect to acquire approximately 55 million of cres coinvestments from ing and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia in addition we expect to incur transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of approximately 150 million pretax including financing retention and integration costs these acquisitions which we refer to as the reim acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by certain stakeholders including regulatory agencies in the united states europe and asia 

  

as of december 31 2010 the assets under management or aum in the ing reim portfolio we are acquiring totaled approximately 598 billion cbre investors’ assets under management totaled 376 billion as of december 31 2010 the methodologies used by the ing reim business units and cbre investors to determine their respective aum are not the same and accordingly the reported aum of ing reim would be different if calculated using a methodology consistent with that of cbre investors’ methodology to the extent applicable ing reim’s reported aum was converted from euros to us dollars using an exchange rate of 13379 per €1 ing reim when combined with our existing global investment management operations will provide us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies 

  

we have historically also supplemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialtyniche firms that are leaders in their areas of concentration or in their local markets including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships these “infill” acquisitions remain an integral part of our longterm strategy 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

cb richard ellis group inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries cb richard ellis services inc our direct whollyowned subsidiary is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness 

  

we report our operations through the following segments 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services 

  

information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of our segments is included in “segment operations” within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section and within note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

the americas 

  

the americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the united states and in the largest metropolitan regions in canada and selected parts of latin america through both whollyowned operations as well as independent affiliated offices our agreements with these independent affiliate offices include licenses to use the “cb richard ellis” name in the relevant territory in return for payments of annual royalty fees to us in addition these agreements also include business crossreferral arrangements between us and our affiliates 

  

most of our advisory services and outsourcing services operations are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis inc our mortgage loan origination and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary operating under the name cbre capital markets and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis limited 

  

our americas segment accounted for 629 of our 2010 revenue 623 of our 2009 revenue and 626 of our 2008 revenue within our americas segment we organize our services into the following business areas 

  

advisory services 

  

our advisory services businesses offer occupiertenant and investorowner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs including 1 real estate services 2 capital markets and 3 valuation our advisory services business line accounted for 350 of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue 308 of our 2009 consolidated worldwide revenue and 346 of our 2008 consolidated worldwide revenue 

  

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we also believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms including professional development and training market research and information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through our commercial real estate market information and forecasting unit cbre econometric advisors cbreea formerly cbre torto wheaton research this group provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including market outlook reports for the office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering more than 110 metropolitan areas in the united states and canada 

  

   

we believe our investment properties business which includes office industrial retail multifamily and hotel properties is the leading investment sales property advisors in the united states with a market share of 

  

approximately 15 in 2010 our mortgage brokerage business originates sells and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms national banks credit companies insurance companies pension funds and government agencies our mortgage loan origination volume in 2010 was 101 billion representing an increase of approximately 68 from 2009 approximately 42 billion of loans in 2010 were originated for federal government sponsored entities most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose loans financed through the revolving credit lines generally occur with principal risk that is substantially mitigated because before the loan is originated we obtain either a contractual purchase commitment from the government sponsored entity or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage backed security that will be secured by the loan we advised on the sale of approximately 45 billion of underperforming mortgages on behalf of financial institutions in 2010 compared with 06 billion in 2009 in 2010 gemsa loan services a joint venture between cbre capital markets and ge capital real estate serviced approximately 1127 billion of mortgage loans 545 billion of which related to the servicing rights of cbre capital markets 

  

   

outsourcing services 

  

outsourcing is a longterm trend in commercial real estate with corporations institutions public sector entities and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of thirdparty real estate specialists our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend 1 corporate services and 2 asset services agreements with our corporate services clients are generally longterm arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination there are usually penalties for early termination although our management agreements with our asset services clients generally may be terminated with notice ranging between 30 to 90 days we have developed longterm relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships as of december 31 2010 we managed nearly 13 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the americas our outsourcing services business line accounted for 279 of our 2010 consolidated worldwide revenue 315 of our 2009 consolidated worldwide revenue and 280 of our 2008 consolidated worldwide revenue

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2010 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and 

  

consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented and competitive although many of our competitors are local or regional firms and are substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield and jones lang lasalle as well as national firms such as grubb  ellis 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2010 we had approximately 31000 employees worldwide excluding affiliate offices many of which are in our outsourcing operations and are fully reimbursed by our clients at december 31 2010 715 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business in new york new jersey illinois and california we believe that relations with our employees are generally good 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cb richard ellis” the “cbre” and the “trammell crow” names with respect to the cb richard ellis and cbre names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which may be revoked if we fail to satisfy usage and quality control covenants under the license agreement

environmental matters 

  

us federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real 

  

estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property regardless of the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at or near several properties owned operated or managed by us which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the most significant risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

  

the consummation and anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions may not be realized as we contemplated  

  

we are acquiring ing reim with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits including among others enhanced revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities cost 

  

savings certain tax benefits and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the reim acquisitions will be subject to a number of uncertainties including whether we successfully close each acquisition as contemplated integrate the business being acquired achieve expected synergies and realize accretive benefits in the timeframe anticipated failure to achieve these anticipated benefits as well as the failure to successfully implement a plan of financing in connection with the reim acquisitions could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our overall business financial condition and operating results 

  

completion of each of the reim acquisitions is conditioned upon among other things approval of certain regulatory authorities in the united states europe and asia in addition the reim acquisitions are conditioned upon the receipt of consents from managing boards investors or other parties necessary to transfer minimum levels of annualized revenue for the accounts managed by ing reim while we and ing intend to pursue vigorously all required approvals and consents and expect to obtain such approvals and consents by the time such acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011 we can provide no assurance that we will do so successfully or on a timely basis in addition the acquisitions of the usbased global real estate listed securities business on the one hand and the real estate investment management business in europe and asia on the other are not conditioned on each other there can be no assurance that both or either of the components of the reim acquisitions will be consummated or as to the timing of the closings of each component any delay in the reim acquisitions could diminish the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions and result in additional transaction costs in addition any uncertainty over our ability to complete the reim acquisitions could make it more difficult for us to pursue particular business strategies 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business could be harmed by an economic slowdown and downturn in real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates declining employment levels declining demand for real estate declining real estate values or the public perception that any of these events may occur may negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines these economic conditions can result in a general decline in acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents which in turn reduces revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales leases and mortgage brokerage as well as revenues associated with investment management andor development activities in addition these conditions can lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development 

  

our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets during an economic downturn investment capital is usually constrained and it may take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the value of our real estate investments may be reduced and we could realize losses or diminished profitability in addition economic downturns may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments as described in other risk factors our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

during 2008 and 2009 credit became severely constrained and prohibitively expensive and real estate market activity contracted sharply in most markets around the world as a result of the global financial crisis and the deep economic recession these adverse macro conditions impacted real estate services companies like ours by significantly hampering transaction activity and lowering real estate valuations similar to other commercial real estate services firms our transaction volumes fell during 2008 and most of 2009 and as a result our stock price declined significantly 

  

if the economic and market conditions that prevailed in 2008 and 2009 were to return our business performance and profitability could again deteriorate if this were to occur we could fail to comply with certain financial covenants in our credit agreement which would force us to seek an amendment with our lenders no assurance can be given that we would be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms if at all in addition in an extreme deterioration of our business we could have insufficient liquidity to meet our debt service obligations when they come due in future years 

  

adverse developments in the credit markets may harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

in 2008 and 2009 the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude this disruption reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding in some cases these sources were eliminated while the credit market has shown signs of improving since the second half of 2009 liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy this uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions affect and in many respects limit or prohibit our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our credit agreement currently requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of ebitda as defined in the credit agreement to total interest expense of 225x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda as defined in the credit agreement of 375x our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure that we will be able to meet those ratios when required for example we experienced a decline in ebitda during the economic downturn in 2008 to 2009 which negatively impacted our minimum coverage ratio and maximum leverage ratio however we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and 2009 and as a result of these cost reductions as well as renewed growth in our business we are well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio under our credit agreement our coverage ratio of ebitda to total interest expense was 816x for the year ended december 31 2010 and our leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to ebitda was 094x as of december 31 2010 we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain nonus subsidiaries in addition in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowing when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against this pledged capital stock and take control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2010 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit both of which are generally nonrecourse to us was approximately 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2010 our interest expense was approximately 1912 million in connection with the reim acquisitions we also expect to incur approximately 800 million of new term loans under our secured credit agreement to finance such acquisitions our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase if we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement our debt service obligations may be substantially increased 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

from time to time moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our class a common stock 

  

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which if accomplished may adversely impact our stock price 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre capital markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

the deteriorating financial condition andor results of operations of certain of our clients could adversely affect our business 

  

we could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients if that led to losses or defaults by one or more of them which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its results of operations and financial condition as a result a client may fail to make payments when due become insolvent or declare bankruptcy any client bankruptcy or insolvency or the failure of any client to make payments when due could result in material losses to our company a client bankruptcy would delay or preclude full collection of amounts owed to us additionally certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients if such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or 

  

other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and our stock price for example due to the severe market downturn and credit crisis we determined in december 2008 that the negative impact of the global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment as a result and as described in the financial statements included in this annual report we incurred charges of 12 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2008 a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including brett white our chief executive officer mr white and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant majority of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees including those acquired through acquisitions or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel we use equity incentives to help retain and incentivize our key personnel any significant decline in or failure to grow our stock price may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2010 we generated approximately 40 of our revenue from operations outside the united states additional circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we maintain an anticorruption compliance program throughout the company violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties equitable remedies including disgorgement and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2010 approximately 40 of our revenue was transacted in foreign currencies the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may result in corresponding fluctuations in our revenue and earnings 

  

over time fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future or perform as expected 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of the trammell crow company in december 2006 we have also entered into definitive agreements to acquire ing reim’s operations in europe and asia and its cres business in the united states as well as certain related coinvestments any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions we may incur significant additional debt from time to time to finance any such acquisitions subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our thenexisting indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our thenexisting debt would increase in addition acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses which include severance lease termination transaction deferred financing and mergerrelated costs among others 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently 

  

involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels as with prior material transactions we expect to incur significant integration expenses associated with the expected reim acquisitions in 2011 and beyond 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services line of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investments as of december 31 2010 we had committed 115 million to fund future coinvestments all of which is expected to be funded during 2011 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments including damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors participating as a coinvestor is a very important part of our global investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 50 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 309 million and 37 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us in addition to being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable in addition at december 31 2010 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 45 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 312 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 220 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 17 million excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees requiring us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are 

  

required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss or incentive participation fee 

  

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs and maintain our current fee structure will depend on our continued satisfactory performance 

  

we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity 

  

the investment decisions we make in our global investment management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs and a variety of other litigation claims including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment discretion control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients 

  

to the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct investors may have remedies against us our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law moreover we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to allegations of our having engaged in transactions involving conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed 

  

we depend on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business as well as investors for our global investment management business as a result allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct by us whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities whether or not valid may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our global investment management business and our other global businesses in addition if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us which could materially impact our business 

  

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and although we currently have no specific plans to do so we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other 

  

participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our brand business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2010 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers including outsourcing companies that traditionally competed in limited portions of our facilities management business and have recently expanded their offerings inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours there has been a significant increase in recent years in real estate ownership by reits many of which selfmanage most of their real estate assets continuation of this trend could shrink the asset base available to be managed by thirdparty service providers and thereby decrease the demand for our services in general there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed due to the ongoing economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2010 and 2009 approximately 10 of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california the economic downturns in the california commercial real estate market and particularly in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations and disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations 

  

if we fail to maintain and protect our intellectual property or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties our business could be harmed and we could incur financial penalties 

  

our business depends in part on our ability to identify and protect proprietary information and other intellectual property such as our service marks client lists and information business methods and research existing laws or the application of those laws of some countries in which we operate may offer only limited protections for our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of trade secrets confidentiality policies nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and on patent copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights our inability to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate or timely steps to enforce our rights may have an adverse effect on our business 

  

we cannot be sure that the intellectual property that we may use in the course of operating our business or the services we offer to clients do not infringe on the rights of third parties and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients these claims may harm our reputation cost us money and prevent us from offering some services 

  

confidential intellectual property is increasingly stored or carried on mobile devices such as laptop computers which makes inadvertent disclosure more of a risk in the event the mobile devices are lost or stolen and the information has not been adequately safeguarded or encrypted 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in our role as a real estate broker mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business as well as laws of broader applicability such as tax securities and employment laws brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each us state and certain nonus jurisdictions in which we perform these services if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked in addition our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre investors is subject to laws and regulations as a registered investment advisor and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business as the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance or prevent us from providing certain types of services in connection with certain transactions or clients 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services alleging that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of real estate brokerage or property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2010 

  

   

some of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segments also contain employees of our other business segments often the employees of these segments occupy separate suites in the same building in order to operate the businesses independently with standalone offices we have provided above office totals by geographic region and not listed all of our global investment management and development services offices to avoid double counting 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2010 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2010 we operated more than 300 offices worldwide excluding affiliate offices with approximately 31000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” and “cbre” brand names and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research we generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis since 2006 we have been the only commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 in every year since 2008 we have been the only commercial real estate services firm to be included in the fortune 500  additionally the international association of outsourcing professionals has included us among the top 100 global outsourcing companies across all industries for four consecutive years including in 2010 when we ranked 13th overall in 2010 we were named the premier real estate services provider globally by a number of institutions including the financial times  euromoney and the international property awards sponsored by bloomberg 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates declining employment levels declining demand for real estate declining real estate values or the public perception that any of these events may occur will negatively affect the performance of our business lines from late 2007 through 2009 the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis had significant adverse effects on our operations by depressing transaction activity decreasing occupancy and rental rates sharply lowering property values and restraining corporate spending these trends in turn adversely affected revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing and funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets these negative trends began to reverse in 2010 as commercial real estate markets improved in step with the stabilization and recovery of global economic activity 

  

weak economic conditions in the late 2007 through 2009 period also affected our compensation expense which is generally structured to decrease in line with a fall in revenue compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins was partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition at times when negative economic conditions are particularly severe as they were in 2008 and 2009 our management takes decisive actions to improve operational performance by among other things reducing discretionary bonuses curtailing capital expenditures and adjusting overall staffing levels we began to restore some of these expenses in 2010 as general economic conditions and company 

  

performance improved notwithstanding the recovery in 2010 a return of adverse global and regional economic trends remains one of the most significant risks to the financial condition and performance of our operations 

  

economic conditions first began to negatively affect our performance in the americas our largest segment in terms of revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and the decline in us economic activity accelerated throughout 2008 and most of 2009 the economic weakness became most severe following the global capital markets disruption in late 2008 which caused a significant and prolonged decline in property sales leasing financing and investment activity that adversely affected all our business lines commercial real estate fundamentals began to stabilize in early 2010 and to improve in the second half of 2010 following a return to positive economic growth in the united states in late 2009 and 2010 the 2010 recovery was characterized by slowly decreasing vacancy rates stabilizing rental rates a broadening of credit availability and increasing property sales and leasing activity these recovery trends appeared to gain momentum in the last quarter of 2010 but market activity generally remained well below levels experienced in 2006 and 2007 

  

in europe weakening market conditions first began to manifest in the united kingdom in late 2007 and throughout the continent in early 2008 the major european economies also entered into a recession in 2008 which deepened and persisted through 2009 economic growth improved in 2010 but remained behind other parts of the world as a result leasing activity in 2010 was subdued albeit stronger than in 2009 when activity was depressed investment sales in europe were adversely affected by the financial crisis in late 2008 and most of 2009 however larger markets like london and paris began to show modest increases in investment sales beginning in late 2009 and continuing in 2010 the recovery of sales activity also began to spread to more markets across europe during the course of 2010 real estate markets in asia pacific were also affected though generally to a lesser degree than in the united states and europe by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn this resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in 2008 and most of 2009 transaction activity revived significantly in late 2009 and in 2010 and reflected strong economic growth in countries such as australia china india and singapore 

  

deteriorating conditions also adversely affected investment management and development activity beginning in late 2007 as property values declined sharply and both financing and disposal options became more limited however the financing and disposal markets began to improve in 2010 with the pace of recovery picking up in the second half of the year 

  

the continuation and strengthening of the recovery of our global sales leasing investment management and development services operations depends on more vigorous economic growth and higher aggregate employment in major countries especially the united states continued improvement in the credit markets and a continued rebound of business and consumer sentiment 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world in december 2006 we acquired the trammell crow company the trammell crow company acquisition our largest acquisition to date which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

on february 15 2011 we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing group nv ing for approximately 940 million in cash the acquisitions include substantially all of the ing real estate investment management operations in europe and asia as well as clarion real estate securities cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business collectively ing reim the ing reim operations being acquired are expected to become part of our global investment management segment whose business is conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre investors which will continue to be an independently 

  

operated business segment upon completion of the acquisitions cbre investors has primarily focused on valueadd funds and separate accounts ing reim has primarily focused on core funds and global listed real estate securities funds except in asia where ing reim manages valueadd funds and opportunity funds there is expected to be little overlap in the companies’ client bases with a majority of cbre investors’ clients being usbased and a majority of ing reim’s clients based in europe we also expect to acquire approximately 55 million of cres coinvestments from ing and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia in addition we expect to incur transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of approximately 150 million pretax including financing retention and integration costs these acquisitions which we refer to as the reim acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by certain stakeholders including regulatory agencies in the united states europe and asia 

  

as of december 31 2010 the assets under management or aum in the ing reim portfolio we are acquiring totaled approximately 598 billion cbre investors’ assets under management totaled 376 billion as of december 31 2010 ing reim when combined with our existing global investment management operations will provide us with a significantly enhanced ability to meet the needs of institutional investors across global markets with a full spectrum of investment programs and strategies 

  

aum generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide or participate in oversight investment management services and other advice and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures our aum is intended principally to reflect the extent of our presence in the real estate market not the basis for determining our management fees our material assets under management consist of 

  

   

   

our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers including ing reim as described below and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers our definition of aum is not based on any definition of assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage the methodologies used by the ing reim business units and cbre investors to determine their respective aum are not the same and accordingly the reported aum of ing reim would be different if calculated using a methodology consistent with that of cbre investors’ methodology to the extent applicable ing reim’s reported aum was converted from euros to us dollars using an exchange rate of 13379 per €1 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings from 2005 to 2008 we completed 58 infill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 592 million in light of the recent economic environment no acquisitions were completed in 2009 and 2010 with the exception of a small niche industrial practice in the united kingdom that we acquired in the second quarter of 2010 and a small commercial property asset management and consultancy services firm in hong kong that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2010 the companies we acquired have generally been quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which in some cases we held an equity interest as market conditions continue to improve we believe acquisitions will once again serve as a growth engine supplementing our organic growth 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures which include severance lease termination transaction deferred financing and mergerrelated costs among others and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example we incurred 1966 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 and 35 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with the expected reim acquisitions through december 31 2010 in addition through december 31 2010 we have incurred expenses of 623 million related to trammell crow company in connection with the integration of its business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own during the year ended december 31 2010 we incurred 38 million of integration expenses most of which were related to the acquisition of trammell crow company as with prior material transactions we expect to incur significant integration expenses associated with the expected reim acquisitions in 2011 and beyond 

  

international operations 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional international companies in the future as we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2010 our total debt excluding our notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit both of which are generally nonrecourse to us was approximately 14 billion in connection with the reim acquisitions we also expect to incur approximately 800 million of new term loans under our secured credit agreement to finance such acquisitions our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements place constraints on the operation of our business although our management believes that the incurrence of longterm indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisition of trammell crow company the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness 

  

for example on october 8 2010 cb richard ellis services inc or cbre our whollyowned subsidiary issued 3500 million in aggregate principal amount of 6625 senior notes due october 15 2020 shortly thereafter we repaid approximately 3574 million of various tranches of our term a loans under our previous credit agreement using net proceeds from the new 3500 million senior notes as well as cash on hand in 

  

addition on november 10 2010 we entered into a new credit agreement that provided for the refinancing of 6500 million in senior secured term loans established a new 7000 million revolving credit facility with an extended maturity date to 2015 and included an accordion provision which provides the ability to borrow an additional 8000 million which can be further expanded subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions all of these actions give us increased flexibility and have significantly extended the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue there are four basic criteria that must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant and landlord with the remaining portions of the lease commission earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent the existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or base rent generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements 

  

investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees which are commonly referred to as carried interest this carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period in addition our global investment management segment also earns successbased transaction fees with regard to buying or selling properties on certain funds and separate accounts such revenue is recognized at the completion of a successful transaction and is not subject to any claw back provision 

  

we earn incentive development fees in our development services segment these fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectability our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectability and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our vies including coinvestments with our clients is based on accounting standards update or asu 200917 “ consolidations topic 810 improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities ” this asu incorporates statement of financial accounting standards no 167 “ amendments to fasb interpretation no 46r ” issued by the financial accounting standards board or fasb in june 2009 the amendments in this asu replace the quantitativebased risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity if any has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with a primarily qualitative approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has both 1 the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance and 2 the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from such entity that could potentially be significant to such entity the entity which satisfies these criteria is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary 

  

we analyze any investments in vies to determine if we are the primary beneficiary we consider a variety of factors in identifying the entity that holds the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the vie’s economic performance including but not limited to the ability to direct financing leasing construction and other operating decisions and activities in addition we also consider the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions to replace the manager and to sell or liquidate the entity 

  

we also have several coinvestments in real estate investment funds which qualify for a deferral of the newer qualitative approach for analyzing potential vies we continue to analyze these investments under the former quantitative method incorporating various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary see note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

if an entity is not a vie our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the 

  

cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt 

  

under either the equity or cost method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value when testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments andor look to comparable activities in the marketplace management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach these assumptions include net asset values internal rates of return discount and capitalization rates interest rates and financing terms rental rates timing of leasing activity estimates of lease terms and related concessions etc when determining if impairment is otherthantemporary we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and nearterm prospects of each investment 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cbre in 2001 our acquisition of insignia financial group inc or insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition and from the trammell crow company acquisition other intangible assets include a trademark which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in the united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to the insignia acquisition both the trademark and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts loan servicing rights and transition costs which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds 

  

its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we performed the 2010 2009 and 2008 annual assessments as of october 1 however we were required to reperform the 2008 assessment as of december 31 2008 because economic conditions worsened the capital markets became distressed and our stock price dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 this was evidenced in our 2008 results by weak sales and leasing activity in our americas and emea segments caused by the credit crunch and significant capital market turmoil which adversely affected incentivebased revenue within our global investment management segment as well as reduced real estate sales volume and values in our development services segment based on our assessments of goodwill in 2008 we determined that we had impairment in several reporting units which was driven by these adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for such units the amount of the pretax goodwill impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 was 11 billion we also determined that two of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 840 million representing the trammell crow trade name identified in the trammell crow company acquisition and 69 million representing the cbre melody trademark identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition were also fully impaired the impairment of the trammell crow trade name was driven by the adverse economic conditions causing a significant decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows of the development services segment such that we could not substantiate this trade name having any book value the impairment of the cbre melody trademark was driven by our mortgage brokerage business’s plans to discontinue use of the melody trademark and exclusively use the cbre trademark the amount of the pretax other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 was 909 million 

  

when we performed our required annual goodwill impairment review as of october 1 2010 and 2009 we determined that no impairment existed as the estimated fair value of our reporting units was in excess of their carrying value although economic conditions remained weak for most of 2009 and our full year revenues for 2009 declined when compared to 2008 we did note early signs of an economic recovery taking place in the latter part of 2009 which continued throughout 2010 this was evidenced by several indicators including our stock price 1813 per share on october 1 2010 and 1094 per share on october 1 2009 versus 432 per share at december 31 2008 a return to positive economic growth in the united states in the second half of 2009 and an economic rebound in the asia pacific region with transaction activity beginning to revive in late 2009 these indicators as well as the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented in the second half of 2008 and in 2009 led to a significant increase in the estimated fair value of the company’s reporting units as of october 1 2010 and 2009 as compared to the estimated fair value at december 31 2008 in addition the overall size of our goodwill and other nonamortizable assets being tested were sharply reduced as a result of the 12 billion impairment charge recorded during the year ended december 31 2008 this impairment charge included the writeoff of goodwill in its entirety in two reporting units that were most severely impacted by the weak economic conditions at that time ie global investment management and development services 

  

if we experience a significant or sustained decline in our future cash flows andor if the current economic conditions significantly worsen we may need to perform additional impairment analysis in the future 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2010 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 7546 million 147 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation cost capitalization and allocation disposition of real estate and discontinued operations 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets the “ property plant and equipment ” topic of fasb accounting standards codification or asc or topic 360 establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of topic 360’s “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the “held for sale” criteria 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows management estimates or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally up to 39 years tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives up to 15 years 

  

when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons impairment charges of 246 million 288 million and 487 million were recorded for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition during the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of 23 million and 39 million respectively 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under topic 360 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment had we evaluated our assets differently the balance sheet classification of such assets depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize costs capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially 

  

complete and the asset is available for occupancy which are timing decisions that require judgment costs capitalized include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance interest development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations we expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the “ business combinations ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 805 pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made a difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values where practicable or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land land improvements building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense if we use different estimates in these valuations the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements 

  

disposition of real estate 

  

gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project we evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method this evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated the adequacy of the buyer’s investment the subordination or collectability of any receivable related to the purchase and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer with no substantial continuing involvement by us if the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer’s investment and our continuing involvement in some cases a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition 

  

discontinued operations 

  

topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction as defined in topic 360 a “component of an entity” comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary many constitute a component of an entity under topic 360 increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they 

  

occur the evaluation of whether the component’s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement require judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with the “ accounting for income taxes ” topic of the fasb asc or topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2010 and 2009 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs income taxes depreciation and amortization and goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs additionally we believe ebitda is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments amounts shown for ebitda as adjusted remove the impact of certain cash and noncash charges related to acquisitions cost containment and asset impairments 

  

ebitda and ebitda as adjusted for selected charges are calculated as follows

our consolidated interest expense increased by 20 million or 11 during the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense associated with the 4500 million of 11625 senior subordinated notes issued in june 2009 and increased interest expense reported by our global investment management segment mainly resulting from the

revenue decreased by 198 million or 123 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 due to lower asset management acquisition disposition and incentive fees in 2009 resulting from the continuation of constraints in the capital markets foreign currency translation had an 85 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2009 

  

operating administrative and other expenses were relatively consistent at 1199 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 1204 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this slight decline was primarily due to a reduction in bonuses which resulted from the lower business performance and lower operating costs particularly travel driven by cost containment measures put in place in 2008 and 2009 these decreases were mostly offset by a lower net reversal of carried interest incentive compensation expense in 2009 for dedicated global investment management executives and team leaders with participation interests in certain real estate investments under management excluding the impact of reversing net carried interest incentive compensation expense accruals which totaled 96 million and 331 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively operating expenses decreased by 157 compared with 2008 foreign currency translation had a 51 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 

  

total aum as of december 31 2009 amounted to 347 billion down 10 from yearend 2008 

  

development services 

  

revenue decreased by 311 million or 261 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to lower construction revenue and development fees driven by weak market conditions 

  

operating administrative and other expenses decreased by 737 million or 352 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily driven by lower impairment charges related to real estate assets which totaled 386 million and 593 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively also contributing to the decrease in 2009 were lower construction costs and a decrease in payrollrelated costs including bonuses as a result of lower business performance in 2009 as well as cost containment efforts in 2008 through 2009 

  

development projects in process as of december 31 2009 totaled 47 billion down 16 from yearend 2008 the inventory of pipeline deals as of december 31 2009 stood at 09 billion down 64 from yearend 2008 as a result of the weak market conditions 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our expected capital requirements for 2011 include up to 100 million of anticipated net capital expenditures as of december 31 2010 we had committed to fund 220 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time additionally as of december 31 2010 we had aggregate commitments of 115 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment 

  

management business all of which is expected to be funded in 2011 in recent years the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening which could affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future 

  

on february 15 2011 we announced that we had entered into definitive agreements to acquire the majority of the real estate investment management business of netherlandsbased ing for approximately 940 million in cash the acquisitions include substantially all of the ing reim operations in europe and asia as well as cres its usbased global real estate listed securities business we also expect to acquire approximately 55 million of cres coinvestments from ing and potentially additional interests in other funds managed by ing reim europe and ing reim asia in addition we expect to incur transaction costs relating to the acquisitions of approximately 150 million pretax including financing retention and integration costs the acquisitions are expected to close in the second half of 2011 and are subject to approval by certain stakeholders including regulatory agencies in the united states europe and asia we plan to finance the acquisitions with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit agreement 

  

during 2003 and 2006 we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company in the past two years we also conducted two debt offerings the first in 2009 was part of a capital restructuring in response to the global economic recession and the second in 2010 was to take advantage of low interest rates and term availability absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented recent global capital markets disruption in 2008 and 2009 we historically have not sought external sources of financing and have relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary events our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness our management is unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if this cash flow is insufficient then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the united kingdom our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover any shortfall during 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 400 million and 649 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 36 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2011 

  

the third longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations related to acquisitions for example in connection with our acquisitions of cb richard ellis kk japan in 2006 and cb richard ellis south asia pte ltd india in 2007 we incurred obligations with respect to the future purchase of noncontrolling interests in such entities as of december 31 2009 we had 585 million of these deferred purchase obligations outstanding which were included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets during the year ended december 31 2010 we purchased the remaining noncontrolling interests in japan and india as of december 31 2010 there were no deferred purchase obligations outstanding 

  

on june 10 2009 we completed the sale of 13440860 shares of our class a common stock through a direct placement to paulson  co inc which raised approximately 976 million of net proceeds on june 11 2009 we completed the sale of 5682684 shares of our class a common stock through an atthemarket offering program which raised approximately 488 million of net proceeds the net proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of some of our outstanding indebtedness under our previous credit agreement 

  

in november 2009 we completed the sale of 28289960 shares of our class a common stock pursuant to an atthemarket offering program which raised approximately 2938 million of net proceeds we used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6166 million for the year ended december 31 2010 an increase of 4029 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the increase was primarily due to improved operating performance higher net payments to vendors and to employees under our deferred compensation plan in the prior year and an increase in commission bonus and income tax accruals in the current year these items were partially offset by a greater increase in receivables and higher bonuses paid in the current year 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2136 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 1304 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the sharp increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2009 versus 2008 was primarily due to significantly lower bonus payments income taxes and payments to vendors made in 2009 these decreases were partially offset by lower results in 2009 excluding the impact of noncash impairment charges as well as the impact of a significant decrease in receivables in 2008 versus a slight increase in 2009 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 625 million for the year ended december 31 2010 a decrease of 569 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 the decrease was primarily driven by higher net proceeds received in the current year from the disposition of real estate held for investment and from the sale of servicing rights and other assets a decrease in restricted cash and lower contributions to investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries along with higher distributions received from investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in the current year also contributed to the decrease these decreases were partially offset by the use of more cash in the current year for capital expenditures and earn out payments associated with infill acquisitions 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1194 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decrease of 2996 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily driven by the use of more cash in 2008 for infill acquisitions and purchases of real estate held for investment 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 7842 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 4768 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the sharp decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to higher net repayments of our senior secured term loans in the current year as well as proceeds received in the prior year in connection with equity offerings and the issuance of our 11625 senior subordinated notes also contributing to the decrease were higher net repayments of notes payable on real estate within our development services segment in the current year these decreases were partially offset by proceeds received in the current year from the issuance of our 6625 senior notes 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 4768 million for the year ended december 31 2009 an increase of 1028 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was largely due to higher net proceeds received in connection with equity offerings in 2009 and the issuance of our 11625 senior subordinated notes in june 2009 these increases were partially offset by activity under our credit agreement including 3000 million of proceeds received from an additional term loan in connection with the exercise of the accordion provision of our credit agreement in 2008 partially offset by lower net borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2008 as well as higher repayments of the senior secured term loans in 2009 also offsetting the overall increase was lower net proceeds from notes payable on real estate within our development services segment in 2009

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 400 million and 649 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 36 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2011 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 226 million as of december 31 2010 excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases these letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the normal course of business as well as in connection with certain insurance programs the letters of credit expire at varying dates through december 2011 

  

we had guarantees totaling 108 million as of december 31 2010 excluding guarantees related to pension liabilities consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet as well as operating leases the 108 million primarily consists of guarantees of obligations of unconsolidated subsidiaries which expire at varying dates through november 2013 

  

in addition as of december 31 2010 we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects these guarantees are made by us in the normal course of our development services business each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget however we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees these contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 

  

from time to time we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects we do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business in connection with these activities we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects although we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect and also look to insurance policies that cover this work while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects 

  

in january 2008 cbre multifamily capital inc or cbre mci a whollyowned subsidiary of cbre capital markets inc entered into an agreement with fannie mae under fannie mae’s delegated underwriting and servicing lender program or dus program to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units under the dus program cbre mci originates underwrites closes and services loans without prior approval by fannie mae and in selected cases is subject to sharing up to onethird of any losses on loans originated under the dus program cbre mci has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of 21 billion at december 31 2010 additionally cbre mci has funded loans 

  

under the dus program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of approximately 4353 million at december 31 2010 cbre mci under its agreement with fannie mae must post cash reserves under formulas established by fannie mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur as of december 31 2010 and 2009 cbre mci had 22 million and 12 million respectively of cash deposited under this reserve arrangement and had provided approximately 40 million and 20 million respectively of loan loss accruals fannie mae’s recourse under the dus program is limited to the assets of cbre mci which totaled approximately 1690 million including 1271 million of warehouse receivables at december 31 2010 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 2 to 5 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2010 we had aggregate commitments of 115 million to fund future coinvestments all of which is expected to be funded in 2011 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2010 we had committed to fund 220 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries which may be called at any time 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first quarter with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in january 2010 the fasb issued asu 201006 “ improving disclosures about fair value measurements ” which provides amendments to the fasb asc subtopic 82010 that require new disclosures regarding i transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and ii activity in level 3 fair value measurements asu 201006 also clarifies existing disclosures regarding i the level of asset and liability disaggregation and ii fair value measurement inputs and valuation techniques as required we adopted the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure requirements except for the disclosures about purchases sales issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level 3 fair value measurements those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2010 and for interim periods within those fiscal years we are currently evaluating the disclosure impact of adoption on our consolidated financial statements but do not expect it to have a material impact 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2010 approximately 40 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2010 foreign currency translation had a 441 million positive impact on our total revenue and a 418 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for any such contracts in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency on december 22 2008 we entered into a foreign currency exchange swap contract with an aggregate notional amount of 395 million british pounds sterling which expired on february 18 2009 at which time we entered into another contract with similar terms that was settled on april 6 2009 on may 12 2009 we entered into an option agreement to sell a notional amount of 250 million of euros which expired on december 29 2009 on june 26 2009 we entered into two option agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 55 million of british pounds sterling which was exercised on september 28 2009 and one to sell 100 million of british pounds sterling which was sold on december 18 2009 on april 6 2010 we entered into three option agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 40 million british pounds sterling which was exercised on june 28 2010 one to sell a notional amount of 40 million british pounds sterling which expired on september 28 2010 and one to sell a notional amount of 76 million british pounds sterling which expired on december 29 2010 on april 12 2010 we entered into three additional option agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 27 million euros which was exercised on june 28 2010 one to sell a notional amount of 24 million euros which was exercised on september 28 2010 and one to sell a notional amount of 110 million euros which was exercised on december 29 2010 included in the consolidated statement of operations were charges of 10 million and 37 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option agreements 

  

we also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale fasb asc topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2010 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

  

    

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 10 on our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2010 the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of 32 million on pretax income and cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2010 

  

based upon information from thirdparty banks the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately 6418 million at december 31 2010 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair values of our 6625 and 11625 senior subordinated notes was 3478 million and 5083 million respectively at december 31 2010 

  

we also have 6275 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2010 these notes have interest rates ranging from 185 to 130 with maturity dates extending through 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 36 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair value recognized in current period earnings the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant

during the year ended december 31 2009 we generated revenue from a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients that includes nearly 80 of the fortune 100 companies many of our clients are consolidating their commercial real estaterelated needs with fewer providers and as a result awarding their business to providers that have a strong presence in important markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services worldwide as a result of this trend and our ability to deliver comprehensive integrated solutions for our clients’ needs across a wide range of markets we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing percentage of our clients’ commercial real estate services needs 

  

cb richard ellis history 

  

cb richard ellis marked its 103 rd year of continuous operations in 2009 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake that company grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate services firms in the western united states during the 1940s in the 1960s and 1970s the company expanded both its service portfolio and geographic coverage to become a fullservice provider with a growing presence throughout the united states 

  

in 1989 employees and thirdparty investors acquired the company’s operations to form cb commercial throughout the 1990s cb commercial moved aggressively to accelerate growth and develop and enhance global capabilities to meet client demands the company acquired leading firms in investment management westmark realty advisors now cb richard ellis investors in 1995 mortgage banking lj melody  company now operating under the name cbre capital markets in 1996 and property and corporate facilities management as well as capital markets and investment management koll real estate services in 1997 in 1996 cb commercial became a public company 

  

in 1998 the company then known as cb commercial real estate services group achieved significant global expansion with the acquisition of rei limited rei limited which traces its roots to london in 1773 was the holding company for all “richard ellis” operations outside of the united kingdom following the rei limited acquisition the company changed its name to cb richard ellis services inc and later in 1998 acquired the londonbased firm of hillier parker may  rowden one of the top property services firms 

  

operating in the united kingdom with these acquisitions we believe we became the first real estate services firm with a platform to deliver integrated real estate services across the world’s major business capitals through one commonlyowned commonlymanaged company 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which was initially known as blum cb holding corp and later as cbre holding inc was formed by an affiliate of blum capital partners lp as a delaware corporation on february 20 2001 for the purpose of acquiring all of the outstanding stock of cb richard ellis services in a “going private” transaction this transaction which involved members of our senior management team and affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co was completed in 2001 

  

in july 2003 our global position was further solidified as our whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis services and insignia financial group inc insignia were brought together to form a premier worldwide fullservice real estate services company as a result of the insignia acquisition we operate globally under the “cb richard ellis” brand name which we believe is a wellrecognized brand in virtually all of the world’s key business centers in order to enhance our financing flexibility and to provide liquidity for some of our stockholders in june 2004 we completed an initial public offering of our common stock 

  

in december 2006 we completed the acquisition of trammell crow company our largest acquisition to date which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management solutions across geographies and established resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

beginning in 2005 and continuing throughout 2008 we have supplemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialtyniche firms that are leaders in their areas of concentration or in their local markets including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships these “infill” acquisitions remain an integral part of our longterm strategy 

  

our corporate structure 

  

cb richard ellis group inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries cb richard ellis services inc our direct whollyowned subsidiary is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness including our senior secured term loan facilities obtained to finance the acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

in our americas segment most of our advisory services and outsourcing services operations are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis inc our mortgage loan origination and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary operating under the name cbre capital markets and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are primarily conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis limited 

  

in our europe middle east and africa or emea segment operations are conducted through a number of indirect whollyowned subsidiaries the most significant of such subsidiaries include cb richard ellis ltd the united kingdom cb richard ellis holding sas france cb richard ellis sa spain cb richard ellis gmbh germany cb richard ellis bv the netherlands cb richard ellis llc russia and cb richard ellis spa italy 

  

in our asia pacific segment operations are primarily conducted through a number of indirect whollyowned subsidiaries including cb richard ellis pty ltd australia cb richard ellis ltd new zealand cb richard ellis ltd hong kong and china cb richard ellis korea co ltd korea cb richard ellis pte ltd singapore cb richard ellis kk japan and cb richard ellis south asia pte ltd india

operations in our development services segment are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries trammell crow company trammell crow services inc and certain of its subsidiaries 

  

industry overview 

  

our business covers all aspects of the commercial real estate industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research 

  

we review on a quarterly basis various internallygenerated statistics and estimates regarding both office and industrial space within the us commercial real estate services industry including the total available “stock” of rentable space and the average rent per square foot of space our management believes that changes in the addressable commercial rental market represented by the product of available stock and rent per square foot provide a reliable estimate of changes in the overall commercial real estate services industry because nearly all segments within the industry are affected by changes in these two measurements we estimate that the product of available stock and rent per square foot grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2 from 1999 through 2009 

  

we believe the key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services companies are primarily 1 the continued outsourcing of commercial real estate services 2 the consolidation of client activities with fewer service providers 3 the institutional ownership of commercial real estate and 4 the ability to attract and retain talent 

  

outsourcing 

  

motivated to reduce costs lower overhead improve execution across markets increase operational efficiency and focus more closely on their core competencies property owners and occupiers have increasingly been contracting out for their commercial real estate services including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

consolidation 

  

we believe that major property owners and corporate users are motivated to consolidate their service provider relationships on a regional national and global basis to obtain more consistent execution across markets to achieve economies of scale and to benefit from streamlined management oversight and the efficiency of single point of contact service delivery as a result we believe large owners and occupiers are awarding an increasing share of this business to larger commercial real estate services providers particularly those that provide a full suite of services across geographical boundaries 

  

institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

since the mid 1990s institutional owners such as real estate investment trusts or reits pension funds foreign institutions and other financial entities have acquired more real estate assets these acquisitions have been motivated by a need to diversify their investment portfolios total us real estate assets held by institutional owners was 424 billion in 2009 up from 361 billion in 1999 much of that growth has been driven by reits which increased their holdings by nearly 23 over this time period although institutional investment in real estate has decreased significantly in the past two years due to market weakness and lower portfolio values the long term trend of increased institutional ownership remains intact we believe it is likely that many institutional owners will outsource management of their portfolios and consolidate their use of real estate services vendors 

  

attracting and retaining talent 

  

attracting and retaining the best real estate services professionals is fundamental to a successful growth strategy a broad global platform strong brand and local market leadership position a company well to draw top professionals away from smaller less diversified firms this is especially true during periods of slower market activity investing heavily in the continuous training development and skillenhancement of existing professionals is key to success in this area 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

we report our operations through five segments the segments are as follows 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services 

  

information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of our segments is included in “segment operations” within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section and within note 23 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in note 23 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 

  

the americas 

  

the americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the united states and in the largest metropolitan regions in canada and selected parts of latin america through both whollyowned operations as well as affiliated offices our americas segment accounted 

  

for 623 of our 2009 revenue 626 of our 2008 revenue and 611 of our 2007 revenue within our americas segment we organize our services into the following business areas 

  

advisory services 

  

our advisory services businesses offer occupiertenant and investorowner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs including 1 real estate services 2 capital markets and 3 valuation our advisory services business line accounted for 308 of our 2009 consolidated revenue 346 of our 2008 consolidated revenue and 425 of our 2007 consolidated revenue 

  

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we also believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms including professional development and training market research and information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through our commercial real estate market information and forecasting unit cbre econometric advisors formerly cbre torto wheaton research this group provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including market outlook reports for the office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering more than 55 us metropolitan statistical areas through the cbreea peer select office product including a database covering over 300000 office and industrial properties 

  

   

our investment properties business which includes office industrial retail multifamily and hotel properties is one of the largest investment sales property advisors in the united states with a market share of approximately 15 in 2009 down from approximately 18 in 2008 our us investment sales activity decreased by approximately 69 during 2009 versus a decrease of approximately 63 for the us market as a whole our mortgage brokerage business originates and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms national banks credit companies insurance companies pension funds and government agencies our mortgage loan origination volume in 2009 was 63 billion representing a decrease of approximately 38 from 2008 approximately 37 billion of loans in 2009 were originated for federal government sponsored entities 

  

most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose loans financed through the revolving credit lines generally occur with principal risk that is substantially mitigated because before the loan is originated we obtain either a contractual purchase commitment from the government sponsored entity or a confirmed forward trade commitment for the issuance and purchase of a mortgage backed security that will be secured by the loan in 2009 gemsa loan services a joint venture between cbre capital markets and ge capital real estate serviced approximately 1162 billion of mortgage loans 590 billion of which relate to the servicing rights of cbre capital markets

our competitive position 

  

we believe we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the underlying trends in the commercial real estate services industry which include increased outsourcing consolidation of service providers and institutional ownership of real estate our strengths include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these strengths will continue to create significant opportunities for our business there are also risks that may impact our competitive position which include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our longterm growth strategy 

  

we believe we have built the premier integrated global services platform in our industry which gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing this integrated global services platform during the 1990s we acquired such entities as the koll company westmark realty advisors now known as cbre investors lj melody  company now known as cbre capital markets rei limited and hillier parker may  rowden during the 2000s we made our largest acquisitions—insignia and trammell crow company—which added strength expertise and resources in comprehensive outsourcing services integrated account management and real estate development today we believe that we offer the commercial real estate services industry’s most complete suite of services and that we have a leadership position in many of the top business centers around the world our primary business objective is to leverage this platform on a global basis in order to garner an increasing share of industry revenues relative to our competitors we believe this will enable us to maximize our longterm cash flow sustain our competitive advantage and increase longterm stockholder value our strategy to achieve these business objectives consists of several elements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2009 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield and jones lang lasalle as well as national firms such as grubb  ellis 

  

different factors weigh heavily in the competition for clients in advisory services key differentiating factors include quality service resource depth demonstrated track record brand reputation analytical skills market knowledge strategic thinking and creative problemsolving these factors are also vital in outsourcing services and are supplemented by consistency of execution across markets economies of scale enhanced efficiency and cost reduction strategies in investment management and development services the ability to enhance asset value and produce solid consistent returns on invested capital are keys to success 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2009 we had approximately 29000 employees worldwide excluding affiliate offices many of which are in our outsourcing operations and are fully reimbursed by our clients at december 31 2009 511 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business in the new yorknew jersey illinois and california areas we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cb richard ellis” the “cbre” and the “trammell crow” names with respect to the cb richard ellis and cbre names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which is whollyowned by certain descendents and affiliates of mr trammell crow see “risk factors—we license the use of the trammell crow trade name and this license is not exclusive and may be revoked” for additional information 

  

in addition to trade names we have developed proprietary technology for preparing and developing valuation reports to our clients through our valuation business and we offer proprietary research to clients through our cbre econometric advisors research unit we also offer proprietary investment structures through cbre investors while we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property 

  

such liability may be imposed without regard for the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and such liability may be joint and several with any other parties that are deemed legally liable for the contamination the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials if the liability is joint and several we could be responsible for payment of the full amount of the liability whether or not any other responsible party is also liable under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site for costs that a governmental entity incurs in connection with the contamination 

  

some of the properties owned operated or managed by us are in the vicinity of properties which are currently or have been the site of releases of regulated substances and remediation activity and we are currently aware of several properties owned operated or managed by us which may be impacted by regulated substances which may have migrated from adjacent or nearby properties or which may be within the borders of areas suspected to be impacted by regional groundwater contamination 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at several properties owned operated or managed by us which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the most significant risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business has been and could continue to be harmed by the economic slowdown and downturn in real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities 

  

periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates declining employment levels declining demand for real estate declining real estate values or the public perception that any of these events may occur have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines these economic conditions have resulted in and could continue to result in a general decline in acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales leases and mortgage brokerage as well as revenues associated with investment management andor development activities in addition these conditions have led and could continue to lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development because our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets in addition economic downturns have reduced and may continue to reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

during an economic downturn it may also take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or the selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the carrying value of our real estate investments may become impaired and we could record losses as a result of such impairment or we could experience reduced profitability related to declines in real estate values further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

recently the availability and cost of credit a declining real estate market in particular in those markets in which we have generated significant transaction revenues in the past such as the united states and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward these factors combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown and a global recession the fragility of the credit markets and the current economic environment have impacted real estate services companies like ours through liquidity restrictions falling transaction volumes lower real estate valuations market volatility and fluctuations and loss of confidence similar to other commercial real estate services firms our transaction volumes fell throughout 2008 and 2009 and our stock price has declined significantly since 2007 

  

these negative general economic conditions could continue to reduce the overall amount of sale and leasing activity in the commercial real estate industry and hence the demand for our services we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries our revenues and profitability depend on the overall demand for our services from our clients while it is possible that the increase in the number of distressed sales and resulting decrease in asset prices will eventually translate to greater market activity the current overall reduction in sales transaction volume continues to materially and adversely impact our business 

  

if the conditions that prevailed in the economy and the commercial real estate market in 2008 and 2009 continue for an extended period or worsen in the future our business performance and profitability could continue to fall if this were to occur we could fail to comply with certain financial covenants in our credit agreement which would force us to seek an amendment with the lenders under our credit agreement and no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms if at all in addition in an extreme deterioration of our business we could have insufficient liquidity to meet our debt service obligations when they come due in future years if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under the agreement will be entitled to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt owed 

  

recent adverse developments in the credit markets and the risk of continued market deterioration have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our global investment management development services and capital markets including investment property sales and debt and equity financing services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as marketplace liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market in 2008 and continuing throughout 2009 the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude this disruption has reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding in some cases these sources have been eliminated 

  

disruptions in the credit markets have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasing transactions dispositions and acquisitions of property in addition if purchasers of real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

the scope of the credit market disruption in late 2008 and early 2009 was well beyond what any market participant anticipated while the credit market showed signs of improving in the second half of 2009 liquidity remains constrained and it is impossible to predict when the market will return to normalcy this uncertainty may lead market participants to continue to act more conservatively than in recent history which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions will affect and in many respects will limit or prohibit our ability and our guarantor subsidiaries’ abilities to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as detailed below our credit agreement contains financial covenants that currently require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement to total debt less available cash and a minimum coverage ratio of interest our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those ratios when required due to the decline in consolidated ebitda in recent periods and if our consolidated ebitda continues to decline in future periods and we are unable to negotiate any additional amendments to our credit agreement we may be unable to comply with the financial covenants under our credit agreement in future periods we significantly reduced our cost structure during 2008 and further reduced costs in 2009 as a result we were well within compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio in 2009 we continue to monitor our projected compliance with these financial ratios and other terms of our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

the restrictions contained in our debt instruments could also 

  

   

   

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain nonus subsidiaries in addition in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2009 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit was approximately 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2009 our interest expense was approximately 1891 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional 

  

debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase if we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement our debt service obligations may be substantially increased 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

from time to time moody’s investors service inc and standard  poor’s ratings services a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future as well as the interest rates and other terms of any future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our class a common stock 

  

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which if accomplished may adversely impact our stock price 

  

we have limited restrictions on the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre capital markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

the deteriorating financial condition andor results of operations of certain of our clients could adversely affect our business 

  

we could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients our clients include companies in the financial services industry including commercial 

  

banks investment banks and insurance companies as well as the automobile industry defaults or nonperformance by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by one or more of our clients which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its results of operations and financial condition as a result a client may fail to make payments when due become insolvent or declare bankruptcy for example in 2008 a significant customer of our outsourcing business washington mutual was seized by federal regulators and sold to jpmorgan chase bank na any client bankruptcy or insolvency or the failure of any client to make payments when due could result in material losses to our company in particular if any of our significant clients becomes insolvent or suffers a downturn in its business it may seriously harm our business bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our clients could bar us from collecting prebankruptcy debts from that client a client bankruptcy would delay our efforts to collect past due balances and could ultimately preclude full collection of these amounts any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt entity may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims in the event of the bankruptcy of a large client which would adversely impact our financial condition we expect that the continuing weakness in the global economy will put additional financial stress on clients which may in turn negatively impact our ability to collect our receivables fully or in a timely manner 

  

additionally while no individual client accounted for more than approximately 3 of our revenues on a global basis in 2009 certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients if such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for those costs or for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and our stock price due to the continuing economic uncertainty and credit crisis we determined in december 2008 that the negative impact of the current global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred charges of 12 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets we did not record any impairment charges related to goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets during the year ended december 31 2009 as of december 31 2009 our recorded goodwill was approximately 13 billion our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was approximately 323 million and our total cb richard ellis group inc stockholders’ equity was approximately 629 million as of december 31 2009 our book value per share was 196 a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant further adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period all could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including brett white our chief executive officer and president mr white and certain other key 

  

employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant majority of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees including those acquired through acquisitions or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel we use equity incentives to retain and incentivize our key personnel in 2008 and continuing throughout 2009 our stock price declined significantly resulting in the decline in value of our previously provided equity incentives which may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2009 we generated approximately 39 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we maintain an anticorruption compliance program throughout the company violations of our compliance program may result in criminal or civil sanctions including material monetary fines penalties and other costs against us or our employees and may have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2009 approximately 39 of our revenue was transacted in currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee thus we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of insignia in july 2003 and our acquisition of trammell crow company in december 2006 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions in addition acquisitions involve risks that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses for example through december 31 2009 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and 1966 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures include severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 and the trammell crow company acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

if we acquire companies in the future we may experience integration costs and the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels in connection with the insignia acquisition we have incurred 419 million of expenses through december 31 2009 which are related to the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own additionally through december 31 2009 we have incurred 586 million of integration expenses associated with the acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

if we are unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we acquire we may not be able to effectively manage them moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services line of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2009 we had committed 349 million to fund future coinvestments all of which is expected to be funded during 2010 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments these adverse consequences could include damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors providing coinvestment financing is a very important part of our global investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 60 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 407 million and 35 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us in addition to being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable in addition at december 31 2009 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 40 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 240 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 256 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 20 million excluding guarantees for which we have outstanding liabilities accrued on our consolidated balance sheet 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects each of these guarantees requires us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss the current economic environment has further reduced opportunities for disposition of these investments risks associated with these activities include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

poor performance of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages would cause a decline in our revenue net income and cash flow and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future programs 

  

in the event that any of the investment programs that our global investment management business manages were to perform poorly our revenue net income and cash flow could decline because the value of the assets we manage would decrease which would result in a reduction in some of our management fees and our investment returns would decrease resulting in a reduction in the incentive compensation we earn moreover we could experience losses on coinvestments of our own capital in such programs as a result of poor performance investors and potential investors in our programs continually assess our performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future programs will depend on our continued satisfactory performance poor performance could make it more difficult for us to raise new capital and maintain our current fee structure 

  

we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity 

  

the investment decisions we make in our global investment management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of our clients may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of our programs and a variety of other litigation claims including allegations that we improperly exercised judgment discretion control or influence over client investments or that we breached fiduciary duties to clients 

  

to the extent investors in our programs suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct investors may have remedies against us our investment programs or funds or our employees under the federal securities law and state law moreover we are exposed to risks of litigation or investigation by investors and regulators relating to our having engaged in transactions that presented conflicts of interest that were not properly addressed 

  

if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability whether or not the lawsuit had merit it could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations or cause significant reputational harm to us which could materially impact our business we depend 

  

on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain clients across our overall business as well as investors for our global investment management business as a result allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct by us whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us or our investment activities whether or not valid may harm our reputation and damage our business prospects both in our global investment management business and our other global businesses 

  

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and although we currently have no specific plans to do so we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and commercial mortgage brokerage with respect to each of our business disciplines we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2009 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours there has been a significant increase in recent years in real estate ownership by reits many of which selfmanage most of their real estate assets continuation of this trend could shrink the asset base available to be managed by thirdparty service providers and thereby decrease the demand for our services in general there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed due to the ongoing economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2009 and 2008 approximately 10 of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california the current economic downturn in the california commercial real estate market and in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations negative conditions in these or other significant commercial real estate submarkets could disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations 

  

our results of operations vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year which makes comparisons of our quarterly results difficult 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter this variance among quarters during each calendar year makes comparison between such quarters difficult but does not generally affect the comparison of the same quarters during different calendar years 

  

we license the use of the trammell crow trade name and this license is not exclusive and may be revoked 

  

we have a license agreement with an affiliate of crow holdings that allows us to use the name “trammell crow” perpetually throughout the world in any business except the residential real estate business although we can use this name in serving certain mixeduse properties or in providing investment sales brokerage services to buyers and sellers of multifamily residential facilities this license can be revoked if we fail to maintain certain quality standards or infringe upon certain of the licensor’s intellectual property rights if we lose the right to use the trammell crow name our development services business could suffer significantly 

  

the license agreement permits certain existing uses of the name “trammell crow” by affiliates of crow holdings the use of the trammell crow name or other similar names by other parties may create confusion or reduce the value associated with the trammell crow name 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in our role as a real estate broker mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business as well as laws of broader applicability such as tax securities and employment laws brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each us state in which we perform these services if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked in addition our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre investors is subject to laws and regulations as a registered investment advisor and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business as the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services claiming that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction and engineering services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of an agent for 

  

the owner we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of real estate brokerage or property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances liability under some of these laws may be joint and several meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site despite the existence of other liable parties if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly as it could be difficult for us to develop or sell such properties or borrow funds using such properties as collateral additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

not applicable 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2009 

  

   

many of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segments also contain employees of our other segments as a result if we listed all offices of our global investment management and development services segments it would be duplicative accordingly we have grouped our offices by geographic region above to avoid duplication 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are a party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business our management believes that any liability imposed on us that may result from disposition of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our business consolidated financial position cash flows or results of operations 

  

as a result of an internal review that began in the first quarter of 2010 and is ongoing we have determined that some of our employees in certain of our offices in china have made payments in violation of company policy to local governmental officials including payments for nonbusiness entertainment and in the form of gifts the payments we have discovered to date are limited in number minor in amount and we believe relate to only a few discrete transactions involving immaterial revenues nonetheless we believe that the payments may have been in violation of the us foreign corrupt practices act or other applicable laws consequently we voluntarily disclosed these events to the us department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec on february 27 2010 and have agreed to update the doj and the sec periodically regarding further developments we have engaged outside counsel to further investigate these events and we are implementing thorough remedial measures as a result of these findings we may be subject to consequences that could include fines penalties and other costs and our reputation and business may be impacted however we currently do not believe these consequences are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2009 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2009 we operated more than 300 offices worldwide excluding affiliate offices with approximately 29000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research we generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis in 2006 we became the first commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 in 2007 2008 and 2009 we were the only commercial real estate services company included on the business week list of 50 “best in class” companies across all industries in 2008 we became the first commercial real estate services firm to be included in the fortune 500 and remained the only commercial real estate services company on this list in 2009 fortune also included us on its list of most admired companies in the real estate sector in 2009 additionally in 2009 the international association of outsourcing professionals ranked us the 1 outsourcing company in commercial real estate services and the 8 outsourcing company across all industries 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the cost and availability of credit and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic weakness or recession significantly rising interest rates declining employment levels declining demand for real estate declining real estate values or the public perception that any of these events may occur have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines beginning in late 2007 the severe global economic downturn and credit market crisis have had significant adverse effects on our operations weak economic conditions have resulted in and may continue to result in a general decrease in transaction activity lower occupancy and rental rate levels reduced property values and restrained corporate spending these trends in turn have reduced and may continue to reduce revenue from property management fees and commissions derived from property sales leasing valuation and financing and funds available to invest in commercial real estate and related assets 

  

adverse changes in economic conditions have also affected and will continue to affect our compensation expense which is generally structured to decrease in line with a fall in revenue compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure in addition at times when negative economic conditions are particularly severe as they have been recently our management has taken decisive actions to improve operational performance by among other actions reducing discretionary bonuses curtailing capital expenditures and adjusting overall 

  

staffing levels notwithstanding these actions adverse global and regional economic changes remain one of the most significant risks to the financial condition and performance of our operations 

  

economic conditions have adversely affected our performance in the americas our largest segment in terms of revenue since the third quarter of 2007 us economic activity has progressively weakened since that time highlighted by declining employment and highly constrained consumer and business spending the weakened economic activity was further worsened by the severe global capital market disruption in late 2008 which caused credit availability to freeze up investors to become more risk averse and assets of all types to lose significant value these conditions also caused the economy to contract further and job losses to accelerate resulting in a decline in leasing activity space absorption occupancy levels and rental rates in addition investment sales in the united states fell sharply in the face of significantly constrained liquidity weakened property fundamentals and the repricing of risk in the face of economic and market uncertainty a return to positive economic growth in the united states in the second half of 2009 did not have a meaningful impact on commercial real estate fundamentals as job losses continued to mount properties continued to lose value financing remained constrained and occupancy and rental rates continued to decline transaction velocity remained muted 

  

in europe the weakening market conditions began to manifest in the united kingdom in late 2007 and throughout the continent in early 2008 the major european economies also entered into a recession in 2008 which persisted in most countries through 2009 tempering leasing activity investment sales in europe also worsened progressively throughout 2008 and remained at low levels through 2009 though larger markets like london and paris showed modest improvement in the fourth quarter of 2009 the markets in asia pacific were also affected though generally to a lesser degree than the united states and europe by the global credit market dislocation and economic downturn this resulted in lower investment sales and leasing activity in 2008 and most of 2009 in late 2009 transaction activity began to revive in asia pacific reflecting the economic rebound in leading countries in this region including china and australia from late 2007 through 2009 deteriorating conditions also adversely affected investment management and development activity as property values declined sharply financing options dried up and disposition opportunities became more limited 

  

recovery of our global sales leasing and investment management and development services operations is contingent on among other things the world’s major economies including the united states generating stronger sustained growth with positive employment gains credit markets returning to normal with stable predictable and reasonablypriced financing and business confidence returning for an extended period 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world for example we enhanced our mortgage brokerage services through our 1996 acquisition of lj melody  company now known as cbre capital markets and we significantly increased the scale of our investment management business through our 1995 acquisition of westmark realty advisors now known as cb richard ellis investors our 1997 acquisition of koll real estate services and our 1998 acquisition of the londonbased firm hillier parker may  rowden our 2003 acquisition of insignia financial group inc insignia significantly increased the scale of our real estate advisory and outsourcing services business lines in our americas segment and also significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas 

  

in december 2006 we acquired trammell crow company our largest acquisition to date the acquisition of trammell crow company deepened our offering of outsourcing services for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies added our development services business and provided additional people resources and expertise to offer real estate services throughout the united states 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings from 2005 to 2008 we completed 58 infill acquisitions for 

  

an aggregate purchase price of approximately 592 million the companies we acquired have generally been quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which in some cases we held an equity interest current market conditions have made acquisition opportunities less attractive in the short term in light of the current economic environment no acquisitions were completed during the year ended december 31 2009 however we believe acquisitions will once again serve as a growth engine supplementing our organic growth when market conditions improve in the future 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition and 1966 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures included severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 and the trammell crow company acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007 in addition through december 31 2009 we have incurred expenses of 419 million related to insignia and 586 million related to trammell crow company in connection with the integration of these companies’ business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own during the year ended december 31 2009 we incurred 56 million of integration expenses the majority of which were related to the acquisition of trammell crow company we expect to incur total integration expenses relating to past acquisitions of approximately 5 million during 2010 which primarily include residual integration costs associated with our acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

international operations 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates our management cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2009 our total debt excluding our notes payable on real estate and warehouse lines of credit was approximately 21 billion our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business although our management believes that the incurrence of longterm 

  

indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness 

  

during the third quarter of 2009 we reached agreement with our lenders to extend maturities and amortization schedules on 9850 million of loans outstanding under our credit agreement in addition on february 10 2010 we announced that we had reached agreements with our lenders to extend maturities on an additional 1566 million of loans outstanding under our credit agreement during the year ended december 31 2009 we also repaid 4320 million of our senior secured term loans outstanding under our credit agreement and issued 4500 million of 11625 senior subordinated notes due june 15 2017 these actions combined with the amendment to our credit agreement in the first quarter of 2009 have given us increased flexibility and significantly extended the weighted average maturity of our outstanding debt 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

in order for us to recognize revenue there are four basic criteria that must be met 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant with the remaining portions of the lease commission earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent the existence of any significant future contingencies results 

  

in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or profit generated by the entities managed or the square footage managed these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements 

  

investment management fees are based predominantly upon a percentage of the equity deployed on behalf of our limited partners fees related to our indirect investment management programs are based upon a percentage of the fair value of those investments these fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related investment management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied and following the expiration of any potential claw back provision with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees which are commonly referred to as carried interest this carried interest expense is generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period 

  

we earn incentive development fees from our development services segment these fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectibility our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectibility and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have generally been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary the equity attributable to noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our vies including coinvestments with our clients is based on the “ consolidation ” topic of the financial accounting standards board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic 810 we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie under topic 810 based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary in a quantitative analysis we incorporate various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

if an entity is not a vie our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on voting control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss to the extent of its investment or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt 

  

under either the equity or cost method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value when testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments andor look to comparable activities in the marketplace management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach these assumptions include net asset values internal rates of 

  

return discount and capitalization rates interest rates and financing terms rental rates timing of leasing activity estimates of lease terms and related concessions etc when determining if impairment is otherthantemporary we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and nearterm prospects of each investment 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting which results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 other intangible assets include a trademark which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in the united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to the insignia acquisition both the trademark and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts loan servicing rights and franchise agreements which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we performed the 2009 2008 and 2007 annual assessments as of october 1  we determined that no impairment of goodwill or other nonamortizable intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives existed as of october 1 2009 and 2007 

  

however we were required to reperform the 2008 assessment as of december 31 2008 because economic conditions worsened the capital markets became distressed and our stock price dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 this was evidenced in our 2008 results by weak sales and leasing activity in our americas and emea segments caused by the credit crunch and significant capital market turmoil adversely affecting incentivebased revenue within our global investment management segment as well as reducing real estate sales volume and values in our development services segment based on our assessments of goodwill in 2008 we determined that we had impairment in several reporting units which was driven by these adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for such units the amount of the pretax goodwill impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 was 11 billion we also determined that two of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 840 million representing the trammell crow trade name identified in the trammell crow company acquisition and 69 million representing the cbre melody trademark identified as a result of the 2001 merger were also fully impaired the impairment of the trammell crow trade name was driven by the adverse economic conditions causing a significant decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows such that we could not substantiate this trade name having any book value the impairment of the cbre melody trademark was driven by our mortgage brokerage business’s plans to discontinue use of the melody trademark and exclusively use the cbre trademark the amount of the pretax other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 was 909 million 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2009 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 6934 million 138 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation cost capitalization and allocation disposition of real estate and discontinued operations 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets the “ property plant and equipment ” topic of fasb asc topic 360 establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of topic 360’s “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of land on which development activities have not yet commenced and completed assets or land held for disposition that do not meet the “held for sale” criteria 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows management estimates or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally 39 years tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives up to 15 years 

  

when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be 

  

generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons impairment charges of 288 million and 487 million were recorded for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively in addition during the year ended december 31 2009 we also recorded provisions for loss on real estate held for sale of 39 million no impairment charges or provisions for losses on real estate held for sale were recorded during the year ended december 31 2007 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under topic 360 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment had we evaluated our assets differently the balance sheet classification of such assets depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize costs capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are substantially complete and the asset is available for occupancy which are timing decisions that require judgment costs capitalized include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations we expense transaction costs for acquisitions that qualify as a business in accordance with the “ business combinations ” topic of the fasb asc topic 805 pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made a difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically attributed to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values where practicable or other value methods as appropriate under the circumstances relative allocations of the costs are revised as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land land improvements building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense if we use different estimates in these valuations the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements 

  

disposition of real estate 

  

gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project we evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method this evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated the 

  

adequacy of the buyer’s investment the subordination or collectibility of any receivable related to the purchase and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer with no substantial continuing involvement by us if the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer’s investment and our continuing involvement in some cases a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition 

  

discontinued operations 

  

topic 360 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction as defined in topic 360 a “component of an entity” comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary many constitute a component of an entity under topic 360 increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur the evaluation of whether the component’s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement requires judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with fasb asc topic 740 “ accounting for income taxes ” topic 740 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2009 and 2008 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with topic 740 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 

  

basis of presentation 

  

segment reporting 

  

we report our operations through five segments the segments are as follows 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services the americas consists of operations located in the united states canada and selected parts of latin america emea mainly consists of operations in europe while asia pacific includes operations in asia australia and new zealand the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in the united states europe and asia the development services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states which were acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense writeoff of financing costs income taxes depreciation and amortization and goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangible assets created from acquisitions such items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business segments and for other discretionary purposes 

  

including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs additionally we believe ebitda is useful to investors to assist them in getting a more accurate picture of our results from operations 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda is calculated as follows 

  

  

       

year ended december 31 2009 compared to year ended december 31 2008 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 333 million for the year ended december 31 2009 on revenue of 42 billion as compared to consolidated net loss of 10 billion on revenue of 51 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased by 9630 million or 188 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease was primarily driven by weak worldwide sales and leasing activity as well as lower appraisal revenue all resulting from the continuation of challenging global economic conditions while our outsourcing business continued to add new clients and 

  

expand existing relationships its revenue also declined slightly in the current year as a result of reduced client spending a rise in vacancy rates of properties we manage as well as the effect of client consolidations and distress over the past two years foreign currency translation had a 1292 million negative impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2009 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis decreased by 4788 million or 164 during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the decrease in revenue led to a corresponding decrease in commissions and bonuses foreign currency translation had an 839 million positive impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2009 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 571 for the year ended december 31 2008 to 588 for the year ended december 31 2009 this increase was primarily driven by the large decrease in overall revenue and a shift in the mix of revenues with outsourcing including reimbursables comprising a materially greater portion of the total than in the prior year period 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by 3635 million or 208 during the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease was driven by cost reduction measures that started in 2008 and continued through 2009 which led to lower operating costs particularly payrollrelated travel and marketing costs the decrease was also driven by reduced bonus expense resulting from lower business performance foreign currency translation had a 409 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2009 as a result of our aggressive cost cutting measures operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 332 for the year ended december 31 2009 from 341 for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 33 million or 33 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 this decline was mainly driven by lower depreciation expense resulting from decreased capital expenditures 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was 70 million and 187 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively these gains resulted from activity within our development services segment 

  

our equity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by 460 million or 575 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease was primarily driven by lower noncash writedowns resulting from declines in value of investments in our development services and global investment management segments in the current year also contributing to this variance was a 147 million noncash writedown of our investment in realty finance corporation a mortgage reit within our americas segment attributable to a decline in its market valuation in 2008 which did not recur in 2009 

  

our consolidated interest income was 61 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decrease of 116 million or 655 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease was mainly driven by lower interest income earned in our development services segment due to a decrease in notes receivable in the current year and in our americas and emea segments as a result of lower interest rates in the current year 

  

our consolidated interest expense increased by 220 million during the year ended december 31 2009 or 132 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense associated with the 4500 million of 11625 senior subordinated notes issued in june 2009 partially offset by lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement mainly due to lower average outstanding debt balances in the current year 

  

we wrote off 293 million of financing costs during the year ended december 31 2009 in connection with the amendment of our credit agreement on march 24 2009 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 270 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 508 million for the year ended december 31 2008 our effective tax rate from continuing operations after adjusting pretax loss income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests increased to 447 for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to negative 52 for the year ended december 31 2008 the changes in our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate were primarily the result of a sizeable loss reported in the prior year versus income in the current year a change in our mix of domestic and foreign losses earnings as well as a large portion of the goodwill impairment charges incurred in the prior year being nondeductible for us income tax purposes 

  

our net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on a consolidated basis was 610 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 377 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this activity primarily reflects our noncontrolling interests’ share of losses within our development services segment 

  

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

  

we reported consolidated net loss of 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 on revenue of 51 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 3905 million on revenue of 60 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased by 9054 million or 150 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this was primarily due to significantly lower sales activity caused by the global credit market turmoil and soft leasing performance reflecting weaker economic conditions particularly in the united states and the united kingdom constraints in the capital markets also adversely affected the achievement of incentive based and carried interest revenue in our global investment management segment these declines were partially offset by the continued strong growth in outsourcing revenue foreign currency translation had a 295 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2008 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis decreased by 2740 million or 86 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the decrease in revenue led to a corresponding decrease in commissions and bonuses these decreases were partially offset by an increase in reimbursable expenses within our outsourcing operations as well as increased compensation expense in our emea and asia pacific segments due to acquisitions and investment in growth of our platform foreign currency translation had a 136 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2008 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 530 for the year ended december 31 2007 to 571 for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was primarily driven by a shift in the mix of revenues with outsourcing including reimbursables growth comprising a greater portion of the total and a lower portion of revenue being noncommissionable as well as the aforementioned increase in compensation expense 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by 2416 million or 121 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was primarily driven by reduced incentive compensation expense including bonuses and carried interest expense within our global investment management segment resulting from lower business performance and the benefit of cost reduction steps taken throughout 2008 these reductions were partially offset by real estate asset impairment charges incurred in our development services segment as well as higher worldwide occupancy costs foreign currency translation had a 162 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2008 in 2008 we took aggressive actions to further improve efficiencies and contain costs in response to weakened macro market conditions as a result of these actions operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased only slightly from 330 for the year ended december 31 2007 to 341 for the year ended december 31 2008 despite the significant decline in revenue 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 105 million or 92 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was primarily driven by lower amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition including net revenue backlog as of december 31 2007 the intangible asset representing the net revenue backlog acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition was fully amortized partially offsetting the decrease versus 2007 was higher depreciation expense mainly resulting from increased capital expenditures in connection with recent acquisitions 

  

our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 these impairment charges were primarily driven by adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows for several of our reporting units 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 569 million for the year ended december 31 2007 these charges primarily consisted of severance and lease termination costs which were attributable to the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis decreased by 56 million or 229 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease resulted from activity within our development services segment however when combined with gains included within “discontinued operations” our yearoveryear total gain from disposition of real estate has increased from 2007 by 194 million or 602 however the year ended december 31 2007 was significantly impacted by purchase accounting for the trammell crow company acquisition which required the writeup of assets to fair value upon acquisition thereby eliminating a large amount of gains in 2007 

  

our equity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis was 801 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of 649 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the loss in 2008 was primarily attributable to noncash writedowns of 763 million of investments particularly in our global investment management and development services segments resulting from other than temporary impairments due to declines in market valuations the income in 2007 was mainly due to equity income generated by our development services segment as well as dispositions within selected funds in our global investment management segment both of which did not recur in 2008 

  

our other loss on a consolidated basis was 77 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 375 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the loss for the year ended december 31 2008 related to the writedown of an investment maintained within our global investment management segment due to a decline in market valuation our other loss of 375 million for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily related to the sale of trammell crow company’s approximately 19 ownership interest in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom this sale resulted in a pretax loss of 349 million which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to december 31 2006 when the investment was marked to market 

  

our consolidated interest income was 178 million during the year ended december 31 2008 a decrease of 112 million or 388 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was mainly driven by lower interest income earned in our americas segment primarily resulting from higher average cash balances in 2007 as a result of cash received on the sale of trammell crow company’s interest in savills plc and interest income earned on restricted cash held related to former shareholders of trammell crow company common stock 

  

our consolidated interest expense increased by 42 million during the year ended december 31 2008 or 26 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily due to higher interest 

  

expense incurred within our development services segment partially mitigated by lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement as lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average debt balances outstanding 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 508 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1926 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in the provision for income taxes was mainly attributable to a significant pretax loss reported for 2008 as compared to sizeable pretax income in 2007 our effective tax rate after adjusting pretax loss income to remove the portion attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased to negative 52 for the year ended december 31 2008 from 332 for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by a large portion of our 2008 goodwill impairment charges being nondeductible for us income tax purposes 

  

our net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests on a consolidated basis was 377 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of 145 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this variance primarily reflects our noncontrolling interests’ share of the impairment of real estate assets within our development services segment

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility our 2010 expected capital requirements include approximately 60 million of anticipated net capital expenditures as of december 31 2009 we had aggregate commitments of 349 million to fund future coinvestments in our global investment management business all of which is expected to be funded in 2010 additionally as of december 31 2009 we had committed to fund 256 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our development services business which we may be required to fund at any time for more than a year the global credit markets have experienced unprecedented tightening which may affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future 

  

during 2003 and 2006 we required substantial amounts of equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company absent extraordinary transactions such as these and the equity offerings we completed during the unprecedented recent global capital markets disruption we historically have not sought external sources of financing and relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary events our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months 

  

from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of three elements the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness our management is unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if this cash flow is insufficient then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the second longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations under our pension plans in the united kingdom our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these 

  

plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover the shortfall during 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom the underfunded status of our pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 649 million and 198 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 37 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2010 

  

the third longterm liquidity need is the repayment of obligations related to acquisitions for example in connection with our acquisitions of cb richard ellis kk japan in 2006 and cb richard ellis south asia pte ltd india in 2007 we incurred obligations with respect to the future purchase of noncontrolling interests in such entities as of december 31 2009 we had 585 million of these obligations outstanding which will be paid in 2010 in addition as of december 31 2009 we had a liability of 29 million attributable to our acquisition of trammell crow company relating to outstanding shares of trammell crow company that have not yet been tendered all of our deferred purchase obligations are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  

in prior years obligations related to our deferred compensation plans or dcps were also a component of our longterm liquidity needs on november 5 2008 based on prevailing market conditions our board of directors authorized our chief executive officer to modify or to terminate our us dcps subject to applicable regulatory requirements we notified participants that we would modify the dcps pursuant to the transition rules under section 409a of the internal revenue code of 1986 to allow participants to make new elections prior to december 31 2008 to receive distributions of plan assets at dates they specified in 2009 these actions accelerated distributions from the dcps of cash and shares of our class a common stock to the participants of such dcps but did not have any material effect on our statement of operations in connection with such distributions in 2009 we will receive a cash tax benefit of approximately 95 million 

  

as of december 31 2008 the accompanying consolidated balance sheets included an accumulated nonstock liability for our dcps totaling 2449 million and assets in the form of insurance set aside to cover the liability of 2298 million as of december 31 2008 there were also 2849391 outstanding stock fund units under the dcps all of which were vested our stock fund unit deferrals included in additional paidin capital totaled 55 million at december 31 2008 all dcp liabilities and stock fund units that existed at december 31 2008 were distributed to participants in 2009 

  

in january 2007 we sold trammell crow company’s approximately 19 ownership interest in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom at a net loss which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to december 31 2006 when the investment was marked to market the pretax proceeds from the sale net of selling costs totaled approximately 3110 million and were used to reduce net indebtedness 

  

in the fourth quarter of 2007 we completed the repurchase of 28830442 shares of our class a common stock for a total cost of 6350 million this share repurchase program was funded out of our cash flow from operations as well as our revolving credit facility 

  

on november 18 2008 we completed a public offering of 57500000 shares of our class a common stock which raised 2067 million of net proceeds used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt 

  

on june 10 2009 we completed the sale of 13440860 shares of our class a common stock through a direct placement to paulson  co inc which raised approximately 976 million of net proceeds on june 11 2009 we completed the sale of 5682684 shares of our class a common stock through an atthemarket offering 

  

program which raised approximately 488 million of net proceeds the net proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of some of our outstanding indebtedness under our credit agreement 

  

in november 2009 we completed the sale of 28289960 shares of our class a common stock pursuant to an atthemarket offering program which raised approximately 2938 million of net proceeds we intend to use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes including the repayment of debt 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 2136 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of 1304 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the sharp increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2009 versus the prior year was primarily due to significantly lower bonus payments income taxes and payments to vendors made in the current year these decreases were partially offset by lower results in 2009 excluding the impact of noncash impairment charges as well as the impact of a significant decrease in receivables in the prior year versus a slight increase in the current year 

  

net cash used in operating activities totaled 1304 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 6482 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the sharp increase in cash used in operating activities during 2008 versus 2007 was primarily due to lower results and bonus accruals in 2008 as well as higher bonus payments associated with 2007 made in 2008 in addition 2007 activity included approximately 3110 million in proceeds received upon the sale of the approximately 19 ownership in savills plc these items were partially offset by a decrease in receivables driven by the lower results in 2008 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1194 million for the year ended december 31 2009 a decrease of 2996 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the decrease was primarily driven by the use of more cash in the prior year for infill acquisitions and purchases of real estate held for investment 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4190 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 1346 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily driven by the use of cash for infill acquisitions and a larger decrease in restricted cash in 2007 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 4768 million for the year ended december 31 2009 an increase of 1028 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 the increase was largely due to higher net proceeds received in connection with equity offerings in the current year and the issuance of our 11625 senior subordinated notes in june 2009 these increases were partially offset by activity under our credit agreement including 3000 million of proceeds received from an additional term loan in connection with the exercise of the accordion provision of our credit agreement in 2008 partially offset by lower net borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the prior year as well as higher repayments of the senior secured term loans in the current year also offsetting the overall increase was lower net proceeds from notes payable on real estate within our development services segment in the current year 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 3740 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2773 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the 

  

sharp increase in cash provided by financing activities during 2008 versus 2007 was largely due to 2067 million of proceeds from the secondary public offering of our common stock in 2008 as well as activity under our credit agreement including 3000 million of proceeds received from an additional term loan in connection with the exercise of the accordion provision of our credit agreement in 2008 and higher repayments of the senior secured term loans in 2007 partially offset by higher net repayments under our revolving credit facility in 2008 in addition the repurchase of 6350 million of common stock in 2007 also contributed to the increase partially offsetting these increases were lower activities within our development services segment including lower noncontrolling interest contributions lower net shortterm borrowings related to a revolving line of credit and lower net proceeds from notes payable on real estate

the following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of december 31 2009 

  

  

       

       

significant indebtedness 

  

our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase

from time to time we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects we do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business in connection with these activities we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects although we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect and also look to insurance policies that cover this work while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 2 to 5 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2009 we had aggregate commitments of 349 million to fund future coinvestments all of which is expected to be funded during 2010 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2009 we had committed to fund 256 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries which may be called at any time 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year earnings and cash flow have historically been particularly concentrated in the fourth quarter due to investors and companies focusing on completing transactions prior to calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with revenue and profitability improving in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2009 approximately 392 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2009 foreign currency translation had a 1292 million negative impact on our total revenue and a 1248 million positive impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange swap option and forward contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings we apply the “ derivatives and hedging ” topic of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic 815 when accounting for any such contracts in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk 

  

management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency on december 20 2007 we entered into a foreign currency exchange forward contract with a notional amount of 460 million british pounds sterling which expired on october 31 2008 in order to hedge an intercompany loan on february 28 2008 we entered into three option agreements to sell a notional amount of 140 million of euros 115 million of euros and 377 million of euros which expired on june 26 2008 september 26 2008 and december 26 2008 respectively on december 22 2008 we entered into a foreign currency exchange swap contract with an aggregate notional amount of 395 million british pounds sterling which expired on february 18 2009 at which time we entered into another contract with similar terms that was settled on april 6 2009 on may 12 2009 we entered into an option agreement to sell a notional amount of 250 million of euros which expired on december 29 2009 on june 26 2009 we entered into two option agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 55 million of british pounds sterling which was exercised on september 28 2009 and one to sell 100 million of british pounds sterling which was sold on december 18 2009 included in the consolidated statements of operations were net losses of 37 million and net gains of 16 million for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively resulting from net losses and gains on foreign currency exchange swap option and forward contracts 

  

we also enter into loan commitments that relate to the origination or acquisition of commercial mortgage loans that will be held for resale fasb asc topic 815 requires that these commitments be recorded at their fair values as derivatives the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from these derivatives contracts has not been significant 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2009 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

  

     

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 52 basis points which would comprise approximately 10 of the weighted average interest rates of our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2009 the net impact would be an increase of 106 million on pretax loss and cash used in operating activities for the year ended december 31 2009 

  

based upon information from thirdparty banks the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately 16 billion at december 31 2009 based on dealers’ quotes the estimated fair value of our 11625 senior subordinated notes was 4872 million at december 31 2009 

  

on february 26 2007 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 14 billion on march 20 2008 the total notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was reduced to 9500 million and on march 20 2009 was further reduced to 4100 million the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements was to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities on march 20 2007 these interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges we incurred a loss on these interest rate swaps from the date we entered into the swaps up to the designation date of approximately 39 million there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 or for the period march 20 2007 through december 31 2007 as of december 31 2008 the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was reflected as an 183 million liability and was included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets the interest rate swaps expired on december 31 2009 

  

we also have 5513 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2009 these notes have interest rates ranging from 18 to 83 with maturity dates extending through 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 10 our total estimated interest cost related to these notes payable would increase by approximately 23 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

  

from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair market value recognized in current period earnings the net impact on our financial position and earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate has not been significant

during the year ended december 31 2008 we generated revenue from a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients that includes over 85 of the fortune 100 companies many of our clients are consolidating their commercial real estaterelated needs with fewer providers and as a result awarding their business to those providers that have a strong presence in important markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services worldwide as a result of this trend and our ability to deliver comprehensive integrated solutions for our clients’ needs across a wide range of markets we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing percentage of our clients’ commercial real estate services needs 

  

cb richard ellis history 

  

cb richard ellis marked its 102 nd year of continuous operations in 2008 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake that company grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate services firms in the western united states during the 1940s in the 1960s and 1970s the company expanded both its service portfolio and geographic coverage to become a fullservice provider with a growing presence throughout the united states 

  

in 1989 employees and thirdparty investors acquired the company’s operations to form cb commercial throughout the 1990s cb commercial moved aggressively to accelerate growth and cultivate global capabilities to meet client demands the company acquired leading firms in investment management westmark realty advisors now cb richard ellis investors in 1995 mortgage banking lj melody  company now operating under the name cbre capital markets formerly known as cbre melody in 1996 and property and corporate facilities management as well as capital markets and investment management koll real estate services in 1997 in 1996 cb commercial became a public company 

  

in 1998 the company then known as cb commercial real estate services group achieved significant global expansion with the acquisition of rei limited rei limited which traces its roots to london in 1773 was the holding company for all “richard ellis” operations outside of the united kingdom following the rei limited acquisition the company changed its name to cb richard ellis services inc and later in 1998 acquired the londonbased firm of hillier parker may  rowden one of the top property services firms operating in the united kingdom with these acquisitions we believe we became the first real estate services firm with a platform to deliver integrated real estate services across the world’s major business capitals through one commonlyowned commonlymanaged company 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which was initially known as blum cb holding corp and later as cbre holding inc was formed by an affiliate of blum capital partners lp as a delaware corporation on february 20 2001 for the purpose of acquiring all of the outstanding stock of cb richard ellis services in a “going private” transaction this transaction which involved members of our senior management team and affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co was completed in 2001 

  

in july 2003 our global position was further solidified as our whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis services and insignia financial group inc insignia were brought together to form a premier worldwide fullservice real estate services company as a result of the insignia acquisition we operate globally under the “cb richard ellis” brand name which we believe is a wellrecognized brand in virtually all of the world’s key business centers in order to enhance our financing flexibility and to provide liquidity for some of our stockholders in june 2004 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock 

  

in december 2006 we completed the acquisition of trammell crow company our largest acquisition to date which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management solutions across geographies and established people resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

beginning in 2005 and continuing throughout 2008 we have supplemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialtyniche firms that are leaders in their areas of concentration or in their local markets including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships these “infill” acquisitions remain an integral part of our longterm strategy 

  

our corporate structure 

  

cb richard ellis group inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries cb richard ellis services inc our direct whollyowned subsidiary is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness including our senior secured term loan facilities obtained to finance the acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

in our americas segment most of our advisory services and outsourcing services operations are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis inc our mortgage loan origination and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary operating under the name cbre capital markets and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are primarily conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis limited 

  

in our europe middle east and africa or emea segment operations are conducted through a number of indirect whollyowned subsidiaries the most significant of such subsidiaries include cb richard ellis ltd the united kingdom cb richard ellis holding sas france cb richard ellis sa spain cb richard ellis gmbh germany cb richard ellis bv the netherlands cb richard ellis llc russia and cb richard ellis spa italy 

  

in our asia pacific segment operations are primarily conducted through a number of indirect whollyowned subsidiaries including cb richard ellis pty ltd australia cb richard ellis ltd new zealand cb richard ellis ltd hong kong and china cb richard ellis korea co ltd korea and cb richard ellis pte ltd singapore as well as a majority ownership in cb richard ellis kk japan and cb richard ellis south asia pte ltd india

industry overview 

  

our business covers all aspects of the commercial real estate services industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research 

  

we review on a quarterly basis various internallygenerated statistics and estimates regarding both office and industrial space within the us commercial real estate services industry including the total available “stock” of rentable space and the average rent per square foot of space our management believes that changes in the addressable commercial rental market represented by the product of available stock and rent per square foot provide a reliable estimate of changes in the overall commercial real estate services industry because nearly all segments within the industry are affected by changes in these two measurements we estimate that the product of available stock and rent per square foot grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 4 from 1998 through 2008 

  

we believe the current key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services companies are primarily 1 the continued outsourcing of commercial real estate services 2 the consolidation of clients’ activities with fewer providers 3 the institutional ownership of commercial real estate and 4 attracting and retaining talent 

  

outsourcing 

  

motivated to reduce costs lower overhead improve execution across markets increase operational efficiency and focus more closely on their core competencies property owners and occupiers have been increasingly contracting out for their commercial real estate services including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

consolidation 

  

we believe that major property owners and corporate users are motivated to consolidate their service provider relationships on a regional national and global basis to obtain more consistent execution across markets to achieve economies of scale and to benefit from streamlined management oversight and the efficiency of single point of contact service delivery as a result we believe large owners and occupiers are awarding an increasing share of this business to larger real estate services providers particularly those that provide a full suite of services across geographical boundaries 

  

institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

institutional owners such as real estate investment trusts or reits pension funds foreign institutions and other financial entities have been acquiring more real estate assets many institutional investors have been allocating a significant percentage of their capital to real estate in order to diversify their investment portfolios although down from 2007 to 2008 total us real estate assets held by institutional owners increased to 606 billion in 2008 from 350 billion in 1998 reits were the main drivers of this growth during this period with an increase of approximately 107 foreign institutions increased their us real estate holdings by approximately 50 over this period while pension funds increased their holdings by approximately 29 we believe it is likely that many of these owners will outsource management of their portfolios and consolidate their use of real estate services vendors 

  

attracting and retaining talent 

  

attracting and retaining the best real estate services professionals is fundamental to a successful growth strategy a broad global platform strong brand and local market leadership position a company well to draw top professionals away from smaller less diversified firms this is especially true during periods of slower market activity investing heavily in the continuous training development and skillenhancement of existing professionals is key to success in this area 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

we report our results of operations through five segments 1 the americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services 

  

information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of our segments is included in “segment operations” within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section and within note 25 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in note 25 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference 

  

the americas 

  

the americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the united states and in the largest metropolitan regions in canada and selected parts of latin america through both whollyowned operations as well as affiliated offices our americas segment accounted for 626 of our 2008 revenue 611 of our 2007 revenue and 622 of our 2006 revenue within our americas segment we organize our services into the following business areas 

  

advisory services 

  

our advisory services businesses offer occupiertenant and investorowner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs including 1 real estate services 2 capital markets and 3 valuation our 

  

advisory services business line accounted for 346 of our 2008 consolidated revenue 425 of our 2007 consolidated revenue and 500 of our 2006 consolidated revenue includes activity from the date we acquired trammell crow company december 20 2006 through december 31 2006 

  

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we also believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms for example we believe our professional development and training programs are the most extensive in the industry in addition we invest heavily in gathering market information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through our commercial real estate market information and forecasting unit cbre torto wheaton research cbre torto wheaton research provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including twr outlook reports for the office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering more than 55 us metropolitan areas and the twr select office and industrial database covering over 299000 commercial properties 

  

   

our investment properties business which includes office industrial retail multifamily and hotel properties is one of the largest investment sales property advisors in the united states with a market share of approximately 18 in 2008 up from approximately 16 in 2007 our us investment sales activity decreased by approximately 60 during 2008 versus a decrease of approximately 64 for the us market as a whole our mortgage brokerage business originates and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms national banks credit companies insurance companies pension funds and government agencies our mortgage loan origination volume in 2008 was 102 billion representing a decrease of approximately 59 from 2007 approximately 32 billion of loans in 2008 were originated for federal government sponsored entities most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose loans financed through the revolving credit lines generally occur with principal risk that is substantially 

  

mitigated because we obtain a contractual purchase commitment from the government sponsored entity before it actually originates the loan in 2008 gemsa loan services a joint venture between cbre capital markets and ge capital real estate serviced approximately 1196 billion of mortgage loans 582 billion of which relate to the servicing rights of cbre capital markets 

  

   

outsourcing services 

  

outsourcing is a longterm trend in commercial real estate with corporations institutions public sector entities and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of thirdparty real estate specialists our outsourcing services primarily include two major business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend 1 corporate services and 2 asset services agreements with our corporate services clients are generally longterm arrangements and although they contain different provisions for termination there are usually penalties for early termination although our management agreements with our asset services clients generally may be terminated with notice ranging between 30 to 90 days we have developed longterm relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships as of december 31 2008 we managed over 11 billion square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the americas our outsourcing services business line accounted for 280 of our 2008 consolidated revenue 186 of our 2007 consolidated revenue and 122 of our 2006 consolidated revenue includes activity of trammell crow company from december 20 2006 the date we acquired trammell crow company through december 31 2006

we believe we have built the premier integrated global services platform in our industry which gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing this integrated global services platform we acquired such entities as the koll company westmark realty advisors now known as cbre investors lj melody  company now known as cbre capital markets rei limited and hillier parker may  rowden during the 1990s insignia in 2003 and trammell crow company in 2006 which added strength expertise and resources in comprehensive outsourcing services integrated account management and real estate development today we believe that we offer the commercial real estate services industry’s most complete suite of services and that we have a leadership position in many of the top business centers around the world our primary business objective is to leverage this platform on a global basis in order to garner an increasing share of industry revenues relative to our competitors we believe this will enable us to maximize our longterm cash flow sustain our competitive advantage and increase longterm stockholder value our strategy to achieve these business objectives consists of several elements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2008 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield and jones lang lasalle as well as national firms such as grubb  ellis 

  

different factors weigh heavily in the competition for clients in advisory services key differentiating factors include quality service resource depth demonstrated track record brand reputation analytical skills market knowledge strategic thinking and creative problemsolving these factors are also vital in outsourcing services and are supplemented by consistency of execution across markets economies of scale enhanced efficiency and cost reduction strategies in investment management the ability to enhance asset value and produce solid consistent returns on invested capital are keys to success 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2008 we had over 30000 employees worldwide excluding affiliate offices a good portion of which are in our outsourcing operations and are fully reimbursed by our clients during 2008 workforce reductions made as part of our cost cutting efforts were more than offset by growth in our outsourcing business as well as from acquisitions at december 31 2008 546 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business in the new yorknew jersey illinois and california areas we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cb richard ellis” the “cbre” and the “trammell crow” names with respect to the cb richard ellis and cbre names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which is whollyowned by certain descendents and affiliates of mr trammell crow see “risk factors we license the use of the trammell crow trade name and this license is not exclusive and may be revoked” for additional information 

  

in addition to trade names we have developed proprietary technology for preparing and developing valuation reports to our clients through our valuation business and we offer proprietary research to clients through our cbre torto wheaton research unit we also offer proprietary investment structures through cbre investors while we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property 

  

such liability may be imposed without regard for the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and such liability may be joint and several with any other parties that are deemed legally liable for the contamination the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials if the liability is joint and several we could be responsible for payment of the full amount of the liability whether or not any other responsible party is also liable under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site for costs that a governmental entity incurs in connection with the contamination 

  

some of the properties owned operated or managed by us are in the vicinity of properties which are currently or have been the site of releases of regulated substances and remediation activity and we are currently aware of several properties owned operated or managed by us which may be impacted by regulated substances which may have migrated from adjacent or nearby properties or which may be within the borders of areas suspected to be impacted by regional groundwater contamination 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at several properties owned operated or managed by us which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development services businesses which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make based on the information currently known to us we believe that the matters discussed below identify the most significant risk factors affecting our business however the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business and the trading price of our securities 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business has been and could continue to be harmed by the economic slowdown and downturn in real estate asset values property sales and leasing activities 

  

periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates declining employment levels decreasing demand for real estate declining real estate values or the public perception that any of these events may occur can reduce volumes for many of our business lines these economic conditions have resulted in and could continue to result in a general decline in acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales leases and mortgage brokerage as well as revenues associated with investment management andor development activities in addition these conditions have led and could continue to lead to a decline in property sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in existing commercial real estate assets and properties planned for development because our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets economic downturns have reduced and may continue to reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

during an economic downturn it may also take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or the selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the carrying value of our real estate investments may become impaired and we could record losses as a result of such impairment or we could experience reduced profitability related to declines in real estate values further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

recently the availability and cost of credit a declining real estate market in particular in those markets in which we have generated significant transaction revenues in the past such as the united states and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward these factors combined with volatile oil prices declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a global recession the fragility of the credit markets and the current economic environment have impacted real estate services companies like ours through liquidity restrictions falling transaction volumes lower real estate valuations market volatility and fluctuations and loss of confidence similar to other commercial real estate services firms our transaction volumes fell throughout 2008 and our stock price has declined significantly 

  

these negative general economic conditions could continue to reduce the overall amount of sale and leasing activity in the commercial real estate industry and hence the demand for our services we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries our revenues and profitability depend on the overall demand for our services from our clients while it is possible that the increase in the number of distressed sales and resulting decrease in asset prices will eventually translate to greater market activity the current overall reduction in sales transaction volume continues to materially and adversely impact our business 

  

if the conditions prevalent in the economy and the real estate industry in 2008 continue for an extended period or worsen in the future our business performance and profitability could continue to fall if this were to occur we could fail to comply with certain financial covenants in our credit agreement which would force us to seek a waiver and amendment with the lenders under our credit agreement and no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments on satisfactory terms if at all in addition in an extreme deterioration of our business we could have insufficient liquidity to meet our debt service obligations when they come due in future years if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under the agreement will be entitled to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt owed 

  

recent adverse developments in the credit markets and the risk of continued market deterioration have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our capital markets business which includes debt and equity financing services investment property sales global investment management and development services businesses are sensitive to credit cost and availability as well as market place liquidity additionally the revenues in all of our businesses are dependent to some extent on the overall volume of activity and pricing in the commercial real estate market in 2008 the credit markets experienced a disruption of unprecedented magnitude this disruption has reduced the availability and significantly increased the cost of most sources of funding in some cases these sources have been eliminated 

  

disruptions in the credit markets have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasings dispositions and acquisitions of property for example during 2007 we generated approximately 12 of our revenue from us investment property sales and financing activities for 2008 largely due to credit market and liquidity disruptions our us investment property sales and financing activities accounted for only approximately 7 of our revenue in addition if purchasers of real estate are not able to procure favorable financing resulting in the lack of disposition opportunities for our funds and projects our global investment management and development services businesses will be unable to generate incentive fees and we may also experience losses of coinvested equity capital if the disruption causes a permanent decline in the value of investments made 

  

the scope of the recent credit market disruption has been well beyond what any market participant anticipated as a result the depth and duration of the current credit market and liquidity disruptions are impossible to predict this limits our ability to develop future business plans and we believe that it limits the ability of other participants in the credit markets and commercial real estate markets to do so as well this uncertainty may lead market participants to act more conservatively than in recent history which may amplify decreases in demand and pricing in the markets we serve 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions will affect and in many respects will limit or prohibit our ability and our guarantor subsidiaries’ abilities to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

as detailed below our credit agreement contains financial covenants that currently require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of consolidated ebitda as defined in our credit agreement to total debt less available cash and a minimum coverage ratio of interest our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those ratios when required due to the decline in consolidated ebitda in recent periods and if our consolidated ebitda continues to decline in future periods and we are unable to negotiate an amendment to our credit agreement we may be unable to comply with the financial covenants under our credit agreement in future periods we actively managed our cost structure during 2008 and are continuing to further reduce costs in 2009 as a result our 2009 projections show that we will be in compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio if 2009 revenues are less than we projected we will take further actions within our control and believe that such actions would allow us to remain in compliance with our financial covenants however to provide ourselves with maximum flexibility it is likely that we will approach our lenders to seek an amendment to our credit agreement 

  

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under our credit agreement may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our credit agreement also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under our credit agreement will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under our credit agreement were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

the restrictions contained in our debt instruments could also 

  

   

   

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under our credit agreement the lenders under such credit agreement could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

our credit agreement is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries borrowings under our credit agreement are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the capital stock of our us subsidiaries and 65 of the capital stock of certain nonus subsidiaries in addition in connection with any amendment to our credit agreement we may need to grant additional collateral to the lenders 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations we borrowed approximately 21 billion of term loans under our credit agreement in december 2006 to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company and 3000 million of additional term loans under our credit agreement in march 2008 as of december 31 2008 we had 21 billion of total recourse debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2008 our interest expense was approximately 1672 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase if we are required to seek an amendment to our credit agreement our debt service obligations may be substantially increased 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

from time to time moody’s investors service and standard  poor’s ratings service rate our significant outstanding debt these ratings and any downgrades thereof may impact our ability to borrow under any new agreements in the future as well as the interest rates and other terms of any current or future borrowings and could also cause a decline in the market price of our common stock 

  

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which if accomplished may adversely impact our stock price 

  

we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted by our credit agreement covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank credit agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre capital markets may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

the deteriorating financial condition andor results of operations of certain of our clients could adversely affect our business 

  

we could be adversely affected by the actions and deteriorating financial condition and results of operations of certain of our clients our clients include companies in the financial services industry including commercial banks investment banks and insurance companies as well as the automobile industry defaults or nonperformance by or even rumors or questions about one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by one or more of our clients which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

  

any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its results of operations and financial condition as a result a client may fail to make payments when due become insolvent or declare bankruptcy for example in 2008 a significant customer of our outsourcing business washington mutual was seized by federal regulators and sold to jp morgan chase any client bankruptcy or insolvency or the failure of any client to make payments when due could result in material losses to our company in particular if any of our significant clients becomes insolvent or suffers a downturn in its business it may seriously harm our business bankruptcy filings by or relating to one of our clients could bar us from collecting prebankruptcy debts from that client a client bankruptcy would delay our efforts to collect past due balances and could ultimately preclude full collection of these amounts any unsecured claim we hold against a bankrupt entity may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims we may recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims in the event of the bankruptcy of a large client which would adversely impact our financial condition we expect that the increasing weakness in the global economy will put additional financial stress on clients which may in turn negatively impact our ability to collect our receivables fully or in a timely manner 

  

additionally while no individual client accounted for more than 3 of our revenues on a global basis in 2008 certain corporate services and property management client agreements require that we advance payroll and other vendor costs on behalf of clients if such a client were to file bankruptcy or otherwise fail we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for the severance obligations we would incur as a result of the loss of the client 

  

our goodwill and other intangible assets could become further impaired which may require us to take significant noncash charges against earnings 

  

under current accounting guidelines we must assess at least annually and potentially more frequently whether the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets has been impaired any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of such analysis would result in a noncash charge against earnings which charge could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and our stock price due to the continuing economic uncertainty and credit crisis we determined in december 2008 that the negative impact of the current global economic slowdown and resulting decline in our stock price represented an adverse change in our business climate requiring us to undertake an interim evaluation of our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred charges of 12 billion in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets as of december 31 2008 our recorded goodwill was approximately 13 billion our other intangible assets net of accumulated amortization was approximately 311 million and our total stockholders’ equity was approximately 115 million as of december 31 2008 our book value per share was 044 a significant and sustained decline in our future cash flows a significant adverse change in the economic environment slower growth rates or if our stock price falls below our net book value per share for a sustained period it could result in the need to perform additional impairment analysis in future periods if we were to conclude that a future writedown of goodwill or other intangible assets is necessary then we would record such additional charges which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including brett white our chief executive officer and president mr white and certain other key employees are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant majority of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals the departure of any of our key employees including those acquired through acquisitions or the loss of a significant number of key revenue producers if we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements could cause our business financial condition and results of operations to suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel competition for 

  

these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel we use equity incentives to retain and incentivize our key personnel in 2008 our stock price declined significantly resulting in the decline in value of our previously provided equity incentives which may result in an increased risk of loss of these key personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our stock price is subject to volatility 

  

our stock price is affected by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions conditions specific to the commercial real estate services sector quarterly variations in our results and those of our competitors changes to the competitive landscape estimates and projections by the investment community the arrival or departure of key personnel the introduction of new services by us or our competitors and acquisitions strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors in addition the stock market in general has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations any of these factors may cause declines in the market price of our common stock 

  

in 2008 as economic conditions in the economy generally and particularly within the commercial real estate industry worsened our stock price declined substantially when the market price of a company’s common stock drops significantly a loss of confidence can ensue making new client generation and existing client and key employee retention more challenging in addition stockholders sometimes institute securities class action lawsuits if we are unable to retain key clients or employees or if we are required to defend a securities class action lawsuit against us we could incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management could be diverted causing a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and resulting financial condition in addition in the event we require additional liquidity and raise equity at a time when our stock price is at historic lows the dilution to existing equity holders would be significant for example in november 2008 we raised approximately 208 million by selling 57500000 shares of our common stock in a public offering this offering was significantly dilutive to our thenexisting shareholders 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2008 we generated approximately 39 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans to maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2008 approximately 39 of our revenue was transacted in currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee thus we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of insignia in july 2003 and our acquisition of trammell crow company in december 2006 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us as well as sufficient liquidity and credit to fund these acquisitions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses for example through december 31 2008 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and 1966 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures include severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 and the trammell crow company acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

if we acquire companies in the future we may experience integration costs and the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels in connection with the insignia acquisition we have incurred 419 million of expenses through december 31 2008 which are related to the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own additionally through december 31 2008 we have incurred 535 million of integration expenses associated with the acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

if we are unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we acquire we may not be able to effectively manage them moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services line of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2008 we had committed 619 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 507 million of these commitments will be funded during 2009 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments these adverse consequences could include damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors providing coinvestment financing is a very important part of our global investment 

  

management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2008 we had approximately 70 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 453 million and 41 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us in addition to being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable in addition at december 31 2008 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 40 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries with invested equity of 530 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 365 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 65 million 

  

during the ordinary course of our development services business we provide numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects each of these guarantees requires us to complete the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget while we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees which are intended to pass most of the risk to such contractors there can be no assurance that we will not have to perform under any such guarantees if we are required to perform under a significant number of such guarantees it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss the current economic environment has further reduced opportunities for disposition of these investments risks associated with these activities include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and although we currently have no specific plans to do so we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and commercial mortgage brokerage with respect to each of our business disciplines we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2008 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours there has been a significant increase in recent years in real estate ownership by reits many of which selfmanage most of their real estate assets continuation of this trend could shrink the asset base available to be managed by thirdparty service providers and thereby decrease the demand for our services in general there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed due to the ongoing economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2008 and 2007 approximately 10 of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california the current economic downturn in the california commercial real estate market and in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations negative conditions in these or other significant commercial real estate submarkets could disproportionately affect our business as compared to competitors who have less or different geographic concentrations 

  

our results of operations vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year which makes comparisons of our quarterly results difficult 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter this variance among quarters during each calendar year makes comparison between such quarters difficult but does not generally affect the comparison of the same quarters during different calendar years 

  

we license the use of the trammell crow trade name and this license is not exclusive and may be revoked 

  

we have a license agreement with an affiliate of crow holdings that allows us to use the name “trammell crow” perpetually throughout the world in any business except the residential real estate business although we can use this name in serving certain mixeduse properties or in providing investment sales brokerage services to 

  

buyers and sellers of multifamily residential facilities this license can be revoked if we fail to maintain certain quality standards or infringe upon certain of the licensor’s intellectual property rights if we lose the right to use the trammell crow name our development services business could suffer significantly 

  

the license agreement permits certain existing uses of the name “trammell crow” by affiliates of crow holdings the use of the trammell crow name or other similar names by third parties may create confusion or reduce the value associated with the trammell crow name 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in our role as a real estate broker mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business as well as laws of broader applicability such as tax securities and employment laws brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each us state in which we perform these services if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked in addition our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre investors is subject to laws and regulations as a registered investment advisor and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business as the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services claiming that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction and engineering services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of an agent for the owner we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of real estate brokerage or property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances liability under some of these laws may be joint and several meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site despite the existence of other liable parties if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices excluding affiliates as of december 31 2008 

  

   

many of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segments also contain employees of our other segments as a result if we listed all offices of our global investment management and development services segments it would be duplicative accordingly we have grouped our offices by geographic region above to avoid duplication 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2008 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2008 we operated more than 300 offices worldwide excluding affiliate offices with over 30000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including commercial property and corporate facilities management tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales valuation real estate investment management commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions development services and proprietary research we generate revenues from contractual management fees and on a per project or transactional basis in 2006 we became the first commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 in both 2007 and 2008 we were included on both the fortune list of fastest growing us companies and the business week list of 50 “best in class” companies across all industries in 2008 we also became the first commercial real estate services company in the fortune 500  

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are most crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for such variances in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies directly affect our operations as well as global and regional commercial real estate markets generally these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the availability of credit to finance transactions and the impact of tax and regulatory policies recently concerns over the availability and cost of credit the us mortgage market a declining real estate market in the united states unemployment the prospects of a global recession and geopolitical issues have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the credit mortgage and real estate markets periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur has affected and may continue to negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines weak economic conditions have resulted and may continue to result in a general decrease in transaction activity and declines in rents and property values which in turn has reduced and may continue to reduce revenue from property management fees and from brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these challenging economic conditions could lead to continued declines in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets a sustained economic downturn and the absence of reasonably priced debt financing has reduced and may continue to reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

adverse changes in economic conditions have and continue to affect our compensation expense which is structured to decrease in line with any decrease in revenues compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions is partially mitigated in addition in circumstances when economic conditions are particularly severe our management can look to improve operational performance by reducing discretionary bonuses curtailing capital expenditures adjusting overall staffing levels and implementing other measures to cut operating expenses notwithstanding these approaches adverse global and regional economic changes remain one of the most significant risks to our financial condition and results of operations 

  

beginning in 2003 economic conditions in the americas our largest segment in terms of revenue rebounded from the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002 the recovery which positively impacted the commercial real estate market generally continued through the second quarter of 2007 helping to improve our americas segment’s revenue particularly leasing and sales revenue since the third quarter of 2007 us economic activity has progressively weakened due initially to stresses in the residential housing and financial sectors along with sharply rising energy costs the slowing economic activity worsened into a recession affecting virtually all segments of the economy in 2008 as both consumer and business spending dropped sharply the economic and capital market stresses led to a severe global financial disruption in 2008 this disruption caused a freezing up of credit markets pervasive loss of investor confidence and significant devaluation of assets of all types from the riskiest to the most secure these conditions also caused increasingly negative job growth throughout 2008 and a deepening economic contraction in the second half of 2008 this resulted in an accelerating decline in leasing activity and space absorption rising vacancy rates and decreasing rents across the united states us investment sales activity also began falling sharply from peak levels in the second half of 2007 and remained weak throughout 2008 this decline reflected an absence of debt financing and growing investor reluctance to commit to purchase property in the face of market uncertainty these deteriorating conditions also adversely affected our development services and global investment management businesses in the united states throughout 2008 as property values decreased sharply and disposition opportunities were markedly reduced a rebound of our us sales leasing global investment management and development services businesses will depend upon credit markets returning to more normalized conditions and the us economy resuming its growth 

  

the weakening capital markets trend experienced in the united states began to manifest in the united kingdom in late 2007 and in continental europe beginning in early 2008 as a result investment sales and investment management activities in europe worsened progressively throughout 2008 the major european economies also entered into a recession in 2008 resulting in lower levels of leasing activity throughout 2008 the markets in asia pacific also began to experience increasingly more severe effects from the global credit market difficulties and worldwide economic slowdown as reflected in lower investment sales and leasing activity in 2008 

  

leverage 

  

we borrowed approximately 21 billion under our senior secured term loan facilities in december 2006 to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company on march 27 2008 we exercised the accordion provision of our credit agreement which added an additional 3000 million term loan as a result we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations as of december 31 2008 our total debt excluding notes payable on real estate was 23 billion and our interest expense for the year ended december 31 2008 was 1672 million 

  

although our management believes that the incurrence of longterm indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective early repayment and retirement of indebtedness for example in june 2006 we entered into a new 6000 million revolving credit facility which fully replaced our former credit agreement on more favorable terms additionally we repaid 2860 million of our senior secured term loans during the year ended december 31 2007 and made net repayments of 1839 million on our revolving credit facility during the year ended december 31 2008 our management generally expects to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

notwithstanding the actions described above however our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business our credit agreement governing our term loans and revolving credit facilities credit agreement contains financial 

  

covenants that currently require us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of interest of 225x and a maximum leverage ratio of ebitda as defined in our credit agreement to total debt less available cash of 375x our ability to meet these financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure that we will be able to meet those ratios when required if our ebitda continues to decline in future periods as it has in recent periods we may be unable to comply with these financial covenants under our credit agreement we actively managed our cost structure during 2008 and are continuing to further reduce costs in 2009 as a result our 2009 projections show that we will be in compliance with the minimum coverage ratio and the maximum leverage ratio if 2009 revenues are less than we projected we will take further actions within our control and believe that such actions would allow us to remain in compliance with our financial covenants however to provide ourselves with maximum flexibility it is likely that we will approach our lenders to seek an amendment to our credit agreement in addition if we obtain an amendment to our credit agreement our interest expense could increase 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world for example we enhanced our mortgage brokerage services through our 1996 acquisition of lj melody  company now known as cbre capital markets formerly known as cbre melody and we significantly increased the scale of our investment management business through our 1995 acquisition of westmark realty advisors now known as cb richard ellis investors our 1997 acquisition of koll real estate services and our 1998 acquisition of the londonbased firm hillier parker may  rowden our 2003 acquisition of insignia financial group inc insignia significantly increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services business lines in our americas segment and also significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas 

  

in december 2006 we completed our largest acquisition to date in acquiring trammell crow company the acquisition of trammell crow company deepened our offering of outsourcing services for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies and established people resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also played a key role in expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings our acquirees have generally been quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which in some cases we held an equity interest we completed 16 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 181 million during 2008 primarily in the first half of the year these included three notable acquisitions within our emea segment the acquisition of eurisko consulting srl the largest independent commercial real estate services company in romania which extends our ability to deliver the premier commercial real estate services offering across central and eastern europe the acquisition of cb richard ellis cederholm as an affiliate company in denmark which significantly strengthens our platform in scandinavia by giving us a whollyowned position in one of the region’s most active property markets and the acquisition of espansione commerciale the market leader in shopping centre leasing and property management in italy which extends our international retail services capability in that region in 2007 we completed 14 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 108 million 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example through december 31 2008 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition and 1966 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow 

  

company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures included severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 and the trammell crow company acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007 in addition through december 31 2008 we have incurred expenses of 419 million related to insignia and 535 million related to trammell crow company in connection with the integration of these companies’ business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own during the year ended december 31 2008 we incurred 151 million related to the acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company as well as 13 million of integration expenses associated with other acquisitions completed in 2005 through 2008 we expect to incur total integration expenses relating to past acquisitions of approximately 7 million during 2009 which include residual integration costs associated with our acquisition of trammell crow company as well as similar costs related to a strategic infill acquisition in 2006 

  

international operations 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates our management cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 104 “ revenue recognition in financial statements ” which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether contingencies exist that impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made our revenues subject to the most judgment are brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record commission revenue on real estate sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in revenue when all obligations under the commission agreement are satisfied terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of a lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant with the remaining portions of the lease commission earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy or payment of rent the existence of any significant future contingencies results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

investment management and property management revenues are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or profit generated by the entities managed and are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees these participation interests are generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period 

  

we earn incentive development fees from our development services segment these fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectibility our assumptions are based on an assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are evaluated for collectibility and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary the equity attributable to minority shareholders’ interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our vies including coinvestments with our clients is based on financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 or fin 46r “ consolidation of variable interest entities – an interpretation of arb no 51 ” we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie under fin 46r based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary in a quantitative analysis we incorporate various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

if an entity is not a vie our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income 

  

or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss to the extent of its investment or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt 

  

under either the equity or cost method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value when testing for impairment on investments that are not actively traded on a public market we generally use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our investments andor look to comparable activities in the market place management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow approach these assumptions include net asset values internal rates of return discount and capitalization rates interest rates and financing terms rental rates timing of leasing activity estimates of lease terms and related concessions etc when determining if impairment is otherthantemporary we also look to the length of time and the extent to which fair value has been less than cost as well as the financial condition and nearterm prospects of each investment 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 141 “ business combinations ” this results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

  

in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 other intangible assets include a trademark which was separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in the united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to the insignia acquisition both the trademark and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts loan servicing rights and franchise agreements which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” requires us to test goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment annually or more often if circumstances or events 

  

indicate a change in the impairment status the goodwill impairment analysis is a twostep process the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting unit’s estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill we use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the fair value of our reporting units management judgment is required in developing the assumptions for the discounted cash flow model these assumptions include revenue growth rates profit margin percentages discount rates etc if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered to not be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment the second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined similar to how goodwill is calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as calculated in step one over the estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a business’s fair value and the relative size of our goodwill if different assumptions and estimates were used it could have an adverse effect on our impairment analysis 

  

our annual assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives has historically been completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we performed the 2008 annual assessment as of october 1 2008 however we were required to reperform this assessment as of december 31 2008 because economic conditions worsened the capital markets became distressed and our stock price dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008 this was evidenced in our 2008 results by weak sales and leasing activity in our americas and emea segments caused by the credit crunch and significant capital market turmoil adversely affecting incentivebased revenue within our global investment management segment as well as reducing real estate sales volume and values in our development services segment based on our assessments of goodwill in 2008 we determined that we had impairment in several reporting units which was driven by these adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows expected for such units the amount of the pretax goodwill impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 was 11 billion we also determined that two of our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 840 million representing the trammell crow trade name identified in the trammell crow company acquisition and 69 million representing the cbre melody trade mark identified as a result of the 2001 merger were also fully impaired the impairment of the trammell crow trade name was driven by the adverse economic conditions causing a significant decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows such that we could not substantiate this trade name having any book value the impairment of the cbre melody trade mark was driven by our mortgage brokerage business’s plans to discontinue use of the melody trade mark and exclusively use the cbre trade mark the amount of the pretax other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment charges included in our statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2008 was 909 million we previously determined that no impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives existed as of october 1 2007 and 2006 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2008 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 7900 million 17 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation cost capitalization and allocation disposition of real estate and discontinued operations 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of the sfas no144 “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated 

  

balance sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of completed assets not expected to be disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date and land on which development activities have not yet commenced 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows management estimates or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally 39 years tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives up to 15 years 

  

when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset or market comparisons are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis management estimates or market comparisons impairment charges of 487 million were recorded for the year ended december 31 2008 no impairment charges were recorded during the years ended december 31 2007 or 2006 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under sfas no 144 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment had we evaluated our assets differently the balance sheet classification of such assets depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize costs in accordance with sfas no 34 “ capitalization of interest costs ” and sfas no 67 “ accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties ” capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are complete which are timing decisions that require judgment costs capitalized under sfas no 67 include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made a difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically identified to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values relative allocations of the costs are changed as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land land improvements building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values in accordance with sfas no 141 and sfas no 142 the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense if we used different estimates in these valuations the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements 

  

disposition of real estate 

  

gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project in accordance with sfas no 66 “ accounting for sales of real estate ” we evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method this evaluation requires us to make judgments and estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated the adequacy of the buyer’s investment the subordination or collectibility of any receivable related to the purchase and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer with no substantial continuing involvement by us if the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer’s investment and our continuing involvement in some cases a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition 

  

discontinued operations 

  

sfas no 144 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction as defined in sfas no 144 a “component of an entity” comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary many constitute a component of an entity under sfas no 144 increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur the evaluation of whether the component’s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement requires judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

effective january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standard no 109 ” or fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the cumulative effect of applying this interpretation has resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of approximately 291 million and a decrease to goodwill of approximately 54 million 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2008 and 2007 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 and fin 48 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes

recent significant acquisitions 

  

on december 20 2006 pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated october 30 2006 the trammell crow company acquisition agreement by and among us a2 acquisition corp a delaware corporation and our whollyowned subsidiary merger sub and trammell crow company the merger sub was merged with and into trammell crow company the trammell crow company acquisition trammell crow company was the surviving corporation in the trammell crow company acquisition and upon the closing of the trammell crow company acquisition became our indirect whollyowned subsidiary 

  

the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 include the consolidated financial statements of trammell crow company from december 20 2006 the date of the trammell crow company acquisition as such our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 are not directly comparable to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 

  

segment reporting 

  

we report our operations through five segments the segments are as follows 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services the americas consists of operations located in the united states canada and selected parts of latin america emea mainly consists of operations in europe while asia pacific includes operations in asia australia and new zealand the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in the united states europe and asia the development services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states which were acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization and goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business lines and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda is calculated as follows 

  

         

year ended december 31 2008 compared to year ended december 31 2007 

  

we reported consolidated net loss of 10 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 on revenue of 51 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 3905 million on revenue of 60 billion for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased by 9054 million or 150 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this was primarily due to significantly lower sales activity brought about by the global credit market turmoil and soft leasing performance reflecting weaker economic conditions particularly in the united states and the united kingdom constraints in the capital markets also adversely affected the achievement of incentive based and carried interest revenue in our global investment management segment these declines were partially offset by the continued strong growth in outsourcing revenue foreign currency translation had a 295 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2008 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis decreased by 2740 million or 86 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the decrease in revenue led to a corresponding decrease in commissions and bonuses these decreases were partially offset by an increase in reimbursable expenses within our outsourcing operations as well as increased compensation expense in our emea and asia pacific segments due to acquisitions and investment in growth of our platform foreign currency translation had a 136 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2008 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 530 for the year ended december 31 2007 to 571 for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was primarily driven by a shift in the mix of revenues with outsourcing including reimbursables growth comprising a greater portion of the total and a lower portion of revenue being noncommissionable as well as the aforementioned increase in compensation expense 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis decreased by 2416 million or 121 during the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was primarily driven by reduced incentive compensation expense including bonuses and carried interest expense within our global investment management segment resulting from lower business performance and the benefit of cost reduction steps taken throughout 2008 these reductions were partially offset by real estate asset impairment charges incurred in our development services segment as well as higher worldwide occupancy costs foreign currency translation had a 162 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2008 in 2008 we took aggressive actions to further improve efficiencies and contain costs in response to weakened macro market conditions as a result of these actions operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased only slightly from 330 for the year ended december 31 2007 to 341 for the year ended december 31 2008 despite the significant decline in revenue further these cost reduction efforts will eliminate significantly more expenses for 2009 we will continue to look for ways to realize further operational efficiencies and cost savings in order to maximize our operating margins and cash flow in the future 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 105 million or 92 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was primarily driven by lower amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition including net revenue backlog as of december 31 2007 the intangible asset representing the net revenue backlog acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition was fully amortized partially offsetting the decrease versus the prior year was higher depreciation expense mainly resulting from increased capital expenditures in connection with recent acquisitions 

  

our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment on a consolidated basis was 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2008 these impairment charges were primarily driven by adverse economic conditions causing a decline in the estimated future discounted cash flows for several of our reporting units 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 569 million for the year ended december 31 2007 these charges primarily consisted of severance and lease termination costs which were attributable to the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis decreased by 56 million or 229 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease resulted from activity within our development services segment however when combined with gains included within “discontinued operations” our yearoveryear total gain from disposition of real estate has increased from the prior year by 194 million or 602 however the prior year was significantly impacted by purchase accounting for the trammell crow company acquisition which required the writeup of assets to fair value upon acquisition thereby eliminating a large amount of gains in 2007 

  

our equity loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis was 801 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries of 649 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the loss in the current year was primarily attributable to noncash writedowns of 763 million of investments particularly in our global investment management and development services segments resulting from other than temporary impairments due to declines in market valuations the income in the prior year was mainly due to equity income generated by our development services segment as well as dispositions within selected funds in our global investment management segment both of which did not recur in the current year 

  

our minority interest income on a consolidated basis was 542 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to minority interest expense of 119 million for the year ended december 31 2007 this variance primarily reflects our minority partners’ share of the impairment of real estate assets within our development services segment 

  

our other loss on a consolidated basis was 77 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 375 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the loss in the current year related to the writedown of an investment maintained within our global investment management segment due to a decline in market valuation our other loss of 375 million in the prior year primarily related to the sale of trammell crow company’s approximately 19 ownership interest in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom this sale resulted in a pretax loss of 349 million which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to december 31 2006 when the investment was marked to market 

  

our consolidated interest income was 178 million during the year ended december 31 2008 a decrease of 112 million or 388 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this decrease was mainly driven by lower interest income earned in our americas segment primarily resulting from higher average cash balances in the prior year as a result of cash received on the sale of trammell crow company’s interest in savills plc and interest income earned on restricted cash held related to former shareholders of trammell crow company common stock 

  

our consolidated interest expense increased by 42 million during the year ended december 31 2008 or 26 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense incurred within our development services segment partially mitigated by lower interest expense associated with our credit agreement as lower interest rates more than offset the impact of higher average debt balances outstanding 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 508 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 1926 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in the provision for income taxes was mainly attributable to a significant pretax loss reported for 2008 as compared to sizeable pretax income in 2007 our effective tax rate on loss income from continuing operations decreased to negative 52 for the year ended december 31 2008 from 332 for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily driven by a large portion of our current year goodwill impairment charges being nondeductible for us income tax purposes 

  

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 3905 million for the year ended december 31 2007 on revenue of 60 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 3186 million on revenue of 40 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 20 billion or 497 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this improvement was due to organic growth and acquisitions completed during 2006 and 2007 particularly the acquisition of trammell crow company in december of 2006 the revenue growth was 

  

fueled by continued higher worldwide transaction revenue as well as increased activity in our outsourcing and appraisalvaluation operations additionally enhanced performance from our global investment management business contributed to the increase foreign currency translation had a 1615 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2007 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 11 billion or 517 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenue also contributing to the increase was an increase in reimbursable expenses as well as additional headcount both of which mainly resulted from acquisitions foreign currency translation had a 766 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2007 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 524 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 530 for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily attributable to our mix of revenue 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 20 billion an increase of 6849 million or 525 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide payrollrelated costs including bonuses which resulted from our improved operating performance also contributing to the increase were higher costs as a result of acquisitions particularly our acquisition of trammell crow company as well as increased marketing costs in support of our growing revenue these increases were partially offset by lower carried interest expense foreign currency translation had a 520 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2007 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 323 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 330 for the year ended december 31 2007 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the current year were negatively impacted by higher integration costs in the current year primarily driven by the trammell crow company acquisition and bonus expense in our development services segment that primarily relates to gains on disposition of real estate which are not included in revenue excluding the impact of these items operating expenses as a percentage of revenue would actually be lower for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 457 million or 676 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily driven by higher amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition including net revenue backlog also contributing to the increase over 2006 was higher depreciation expense mainly resulting from fixed assets acquired in recent acquisitions 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 569 million for the year ended december 31 2007 these charges primarily consisted of severance and lease termination costs which were attributable to the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was 243 million for the year ended december 31 2007 these gains resulted from activity within our development services segment 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 316 million or 950 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this was primarily due to equity income generated by our development services segment 

  

our consolidated minority interest expense increased by 58 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily due to minority interest associated with our japanese affiliate cb richard ellis kk or ikoma 

  

our other loss on a consolidated basis was 375 million for the year ended december 31 2007 which primarily related to the sale of trammell crow company’s approximately 19 ownership interest in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom this sale resulted in a pretax loss of 349 million which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to december 31 2006 when the investment was marked to market 

  

our consolidated interest income was 290 million an increase of 192 million or 1953 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was mainly driven by interest income earned in our americas segment primarily resulting from higher average cash balances in 2007 as a result of cash received on the sale of trammell crow company’s interest in savills plc as well as interest income earned on restricted cash held related to former shareholders of trammell crow company common stock see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements also contributing to the positive variance was interest income earned in our emea segment resulting from higher average cash balances in 2007 as well as higher interest income in our development services segment 

  

our consolidated interest expense increased 1180 million or 2621 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the overall increase was primarily due to the additional debt resulting from the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

our loss on extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 338 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this loss was primarily related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the repurchase of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes during the year ended december 31 2006 in addition during the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 116 million of losses related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees as well as premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of our 9 3  4  senior notes and 82 million of losses in connection with the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with our prior credit facility which was replaced during 2006 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 1926 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1983 million for the year ended december 31 2006 our effective tax rate decreased from 384 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 332 for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in both the provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate is primarily a result of the change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings as well as the reversal of a reserve for an uncertain tax position in 2007 which we determined was no longer required 

  

segment operations 

  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses and operating loss income by our americas emea asia pacific global investment management and development services operating segments for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization and goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible asset impairment our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the operating performance of our various business lines and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive programs 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt and goodwill and other nonamortizable asset impairment have been expensed in the segment incurred provision benefit for income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable us and foreign effective tax rates ebitda for our segments is calculated as follows dollars in thousands

global investment management 

  

revenue decreased by 1867 million or 537 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 due to lower incentive fees and carried interest revenue recognized in the current year as a result of constraints in the capital markets foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2008

our calculation of aum may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers our definition of aum is not based on any definition of assets under management that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage 

  

development services 

  

revenue decreased by 151 million or 113 for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 primarily due to lower construction revenue and development fees driven by a decline in market conditions these decreases were partially offset by higher rental revenues as a result of our holding real estate investments for longer due to adverse current market conditions 

  

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 265 million or 145 primarily due to real estate asset impairment charges incurred in the current year as well as higher real estate operating expenses these increases were partially offset by lower bonuses attributable to lower results and a decrease in job construction costs which correlated with the above mentioned construction revenue decrease

development services 

  

the development services segment consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition on december 20 2006 the results for 2006 only include activity from december 20 2006 the acquisition date through december 31 2006 this segment generated revenue of 1340 million and total operating expenses of 1829 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the loss incurred in this segment was largely a result of purchase accounting for the trammell crow company acquisition which requires the writeup of assets to fair value upon acquisition thereby eliminating any gains in the near term for the year ended december 31 2007 this segment’s results were reduced by approximately 616 million as a result of purchase accounting our inventory of inprocess and pipeline projects at december 31 2007 rose 95 from yearend 2006 to 92 billion 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility included in the capital requirements that we expect to fund during 2009 are approximately 30 million of anticipated net capital expenditures the global credit markets have recently experienced unprecedented volatility which may affect both the availability and cost of our funding sources in the future 

  

during 2003 and 2006 we required substantial amounts of new equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company absent extraordinary transactions such as these we historically have not sought external sources of financing and relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary transactions our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months 

  

from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our current longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of two parts the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness our management is unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if this cash flow is insufficient then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments if necessary would be available on attractive terms if at all however we do not expect a liquidity shortfall in 2009 

  

the other primary component of our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases has historically been our obligations related to our deferred compensation plans or dcps on november 5 2008 based on prevailing market conditions our board of directors authorized our chief executive officer to modify or to terminate our us deferred compensation plans subject to applicable regulatory requirements we notified participants that we would modify the plans pursuant to the transition rules under internal revenue code section 409a to allow participants to make new elections prior to december 31 2008 to receive distributions of plan assets at dates they specify in 2009 these actions will accelerate future distributions from the plans of cash and shares of our class a common stock to the participants of such plans but will not have any material effect on our statement of operations the dcps are 

  

substantially fullyfunded and the shares to be distributed are included in our earnings per share calculations upon distribution to the participants we expect to receive a tax benefit of approximately 100 million in 2009 upon completion of the distribution process we expect the plans to be terminated 

  

we expect that any future obligations under our deferred compensation plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations 

  

in january 2007 we sold trammell crow company’s approximately 19 ownership interest in savills plc at a net loss which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to december 31 2006 when the investment was marked to market the pretax proceeds from the sale net of selling costs totaled approximately 3110 million and were used to reduce net indebtedness 

  

on november 7 2007 we announced a share repurchase program of up to 5000 million of our outstanding common stock which was authorized by our board of directors subsequently on november 28 2007 we announced an expansion of our share repurchase program in which our board of directors authorized the share repurchase of up to 6350 million of our outstanding shares of common stock which included the 5000 million previously authorized this share repurchase program was funded out of our cash flow from operations as well as our revolving credit facility and was completed in december 2007 

  

on november 18 2008 we completed a secondary public offering of 575 million shares of our common stock which raised 2078 million of net proceeds used for general corporate purposes 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash used in operating activities totaled 1304 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 6482 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the sharp increase in cash used in operating activities during the year ended december 31 2008 versus the prior year was primarily due to lower results and bonus accruals in the current year as well as higher bonus payments associated with 2007 made in the current year in addition the prior year included approximately 3110 million in proceeds received upon the sale of the approximately 19 ownership in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom held by trammell crow company these items were partially offset by a decrease in receivables driven by the lower results in 2008 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6482 million for the year ended december 31 2007 an increase of 2182 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the trammell crow company acquisition has impacted substantially all components of cash used in our operating activities which makes comparison against the same period in 2006 not meaningful however the sharp increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2007 was primarily driven by approximately 3110 million in proceeds received from the sale of approximately 19 ownership in savills plc furthermore higher results and distributions of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries partially offset by higher income taxes paid also contributed to the increase 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 4190 million for the year ended december 31 2008 an increase of 1346 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the increase was primarily driven by the use of cash for infill acquisitions and a larger decrease in restricted cash in the prior year 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2844 million for the year ended december 31 2007 a decrease of 18 billion as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the use of less cash for acquisitions in 2007 partially offset by the usage of cash to purchase real estate held for investment and higher capital expenditures 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 3740 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 2773 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the sharp increase in cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december 31 2008 versus the prior year was largely due to 2078 million of proceeds from the secondary public offering of our common stock in the current year as well as activity under our credit agreement including 3000 million of proceeds received from an additional term loan in connection with the exercise of the accordion provision of our credit agreement in the current year and higher repayments of the senior secured term loans in the prior year partially offset by higher net repayments under our revolving credit facility in the current year in addition the repurchase of 6350 million of common stock in the prior year also contributed to the increase partially offsetting these increases were lower activities within our development services segment including lower minority interest contributions lower net shortterm borrowings related to a revolving line of credit and lower net proceeds from notes payable on real estate 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 2773 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 the proceeds of 21 billion from our senior secured term loans received in 2006 to fund the trammell crow company acquisition as well as our repurchase of 6350 million of common stock in 2007 mainly contributed to this variance these items were partially offset by the repayment of debt in 2006 increased net borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2007 as well as current year activities within our development services segment including an increase in minority interest contributions higher net proceeds received from notes payable on real estate and shortterm borrowings related to a revolving line of credit 

  

summary of contractual obligations and other commitments 

  

the following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of december 31 2008 

  

   

 

            

indebtedness 

  

our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

most of our longterm indebtedness was incurred in connection with the trammell crow company acquisition in december 2006 the cb richard ellis services acquisition which was a going private transaction involving members of our senior management affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co and some of our other existing stockholders was undertaken so that we could take advantage of growth opportunities and focus on improvements in the cb richard ellis services businesses the insignia acquisition increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services businesses as well as significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas the trammell crow company acquisition has expanded our global leadership and strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management and comprehensive real estate services for our clients 

  

since 2001 we have maintained a credit agreement with credit suisse or cs and other lenders to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs on june 26 2006 we entered into a 6000 million multicurrency senior secured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by cs as administrative and collateral agent which fully replaced our prior credit agreement in connection with the replacement of our prior credit facility we wrote off 82 million of unamortized deferred financing fees during the year ended december 31 2006 on december 20 2006 we entered into an amendment and restatement to our credit agreement the credit agreement to among other things allow the consummation of the trammell crow company acquisition and the incurrence of senior secured term loan facilities for an aggregate principal amount of up to 22 billion on march 27 2008 we exercised the accordion provision of the credit agreement which added an additional 3000 million term loan

deferred compensation plan obligations 

  

our dcps historically have permitted our highly compensated employees including members of management to elect prior to the beginning of each calendar year to defer receipt of some or all of their compensation for the next year until a future distribution date and have it credited to one or more of several funds in the respective dcps because a substantial majority of the deferrals under our dcps had distribution dates based upon the end of a relevant participant’s employment with us we had an ongoing obligation to make distributions to these participants as they leave our employment in addition participants could receive unscheduled inservice withdrawals of amounts deferred prior to january 1 2005 subject to a 75 penalty 

  

on november 5 2008 based on prevailing market conditions our board of directors authorized our chief executive officer to modify or to terminate our us dcps subject to applicable regulatory requirements we notified participants that we would modify the dcps pursuant to the transition rules under internal revenue code section 409a to allow participants to make new elections prior to december 31 2008 to receive distributions of plan assets at dates they specify in 2009 these actions will accelerate future distributions from the dcps of cash and shares of our class a common stock to the participants of such dcps but will not have any material effect on our statement of operations the dcps are substantially fullyfunded and the shares to be distributed are included in our earnings per share calculations upon distribution to the participants we expect to receive a cash tax benefit of approximately 100 million in 2009 upon completion of the distribution process we expect the dcps will be terminated 

  

included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets is an accumulated nonstock liability for our dcps totaling 2449 million and 2906 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and assets primarily in the form of insurance set aside to cover the liability of 2298 million and 2677 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

pension liability 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover the shortfall during the year ended december 31 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom 

  

in connection with this change we recorded a curtailment gain of 100 million during the year ended december 31 2007 and certain plan assets and liabilities were remeasured the underfunded status of our pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 198 million and 342 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively 

  

we expect to contribute a total of 33 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2009 

  

other obligations and commitments 

  

we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 255 million as of december 31 2008 excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs and indebtedness these letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the normal course of business of our development services segment as well as in connection with certain insurance programs the letters of credit expire at varying dates through december 2009 

  

we had guarantees totaling 310 million as of december 31 2008 excluding guarantees related to consolidated indebtedness and pension liabilities for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet as well as operating leases these guarantees primarily consisted of guarantees related to our defined benefit pension plans in the united kingdom in excess of our outstanding pension liability of 198 million as of december 31 2008 the remaining guarantees primarily included debt repayment guarantees of unconsolidated subsidiaries as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas the guarantee obligations related to debt repayment guarantees of unconsolidated subsidiaries expire at varying dates through december 2009 the other guarantees will expire at the end of each of the respective agreements 

  

we have several other debt repayment guarantees of unconsolidated subsidiaries that are subject to the provisions of fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others—an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34” we estimate that our likely exposure under these guarantees is not material on this basis we estimate that the fair value of these guarantees is equivalent to the amount necessary to secure the guarantees using letters of credit from a bank and the aggregate amount is nominal 

  

in addition as of december 31 2008 we had numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects these guarantees are made by us in the normal course of our development services business each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget however we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees these contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 

  

from time to time we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects we do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business in connection with these activities we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect and also look to insurance policies that cover this work while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects 

  

in january 2008 cbre capital markets entered into an agreement with fannie mae under fannie mae’s delegated underwriting and servicing dus lender program to provide financing for apartments with five or more units under the dus program cbre capital markets originates underwrites closes and services loans without prior approval by fannie mae and in selected cases is subject to sharing up to onethird of any losses on loans issued under the dus program cbre capital markets has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of 3098 million additionally cbre capital markets has funded loans under the dus program that are not subject to loss sharing arrangements with unpaid principal balances of 

  

approximately 2050 million cbre capital markets under its agreement with fannie mae must post cash reserves under formulas established by fannie mae to provide for sufficient capital in the event losses occur as of december 31 2008 cbre capital markets had 06 million of cash reserved under this arrangement 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 2 to 5 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2008 we had committed 619 million to fund future coinvestments of which 507 million is expected to be funded during 2009 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2008 we had committed to fund 365 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries which may be called at any time 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the calendar yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2008 approximately 394 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian 

  

dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2008 foreign currency translation had a 295 million positive impact on our total revenue and a 298 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange forward option and swap contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended when accounting for any such contracts in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency on january 22 2007 we entered into an option agreement to sell a notional amount of 500 million british pounds sterling which expired on december 27 2007 on april 2 2007 we entered into three options agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 170 million euros which expired on june 27 2007 the second option agreement was to sell a notional amount of 190 million euros and expired on september 26 2007 the third option agreement was to sell a notional amount of 380 million euros and expired on december 27 2007 on december 20 2007 we entered into a foreign currency exchange forward contract with a notional amount of 460 million british pounds sterling which expired on october 31 2008 in order to hedge an intercompany loan on february 28 2008 we entered into three option agreements to sell a notional amount of 140 million of euros 115 million of euros and 377 million of euros which expired on june 26 2008 september 26 2008 and december 26 2008 respectively on december 22 2008 we entered into a foreign currency exchange swap contract with an aggregate notional amount of 395 million british pounds sterling which expired on february 18 2009 at which time we entered into another contract with similar terms that expires on april 6 2009 included in the consolidated statements of operations were gains of 16 million and losses of 81 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively resulting from net gains and losses on foreign currency exchange option forward and swap contracts 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2008 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

  

     

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 23 basis points which would comprise approximately 10 of the weighted average interest rates of our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2008 the net impact would be a decrease of 54 million on pretax income and cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

based upon valuations from thirdparty banks the estimated fair value of our senior secured term loans was approximately 11 billion estimated fair values of our remaining longterm debt are not presented because we believe that they are not materially different from book value borrowings are floating rate instruments and we believe that for similar financial instruments with comparable credit risks the stated interest rates as of december 31 2008 floating rates at spreads over a market rate index approximate market rates accordingly the carrying value is believed to approximate fair value 

  

on february 26 2007 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 14 billion and a maturity date of december 31 2009 the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities on march 20 2007 these interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 we incurred a loss on these interest rate swaps from the date we entered into the swaps up to the designation date of approximately 39 million which is included in other loss in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended december 31 2008 or for the period from march 20 2007 through december 31 2007 on march 20 2008 the total notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was reduced to 9500 million on march 20 2009 the total notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements will be reduced further to 4100 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 the fair values of these interest rate swap agreements were reflected as an 183 million liability and a 171 million liability respectively and were included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  

we also have 6177 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2008 these notes have interest rates ranging from 23 to 80 with maturity dates extending through 2023 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 62 million 

  

from time to time we enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate if any of these agreements are not designated as effective hedges under sfas no 133 then they are marked to market each period with the change in fair market value recognized in current period earnings there was no significant net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate swap and cap agreements associated with notes payable on real estate for the year ended december 31 2008

company overview

during the year ended december 31 2007 we generated revenue from a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients that includes over 85 of the fortune 100 companies many of our clients are consolidating their commercial real estaterelated needs with fewer providers and as a result awarding their business to those providers that have a strong presence in important markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services worldwide as a result of this trend and our ability to deliver comprehensive integrated solutions for our clients’ needs across a wide range of markets we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing percentage of our clients’ commercial real estate services needs 

  

cb richard ellis history 

  

cb richard ellis marked its 101 st year of continuous operations in 2007 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake that company grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate services firms in the western united states during the 1940s in the 1960s and 1970s the company expanded both its service portfolio and geographic coverage to become a fullservice provider with a growing presence throughout the united states 

  

in 1989 employees and thirdparty investors acquired the company’s operations to form cb commercial throughout the 1990s cb commercial moved aggressively to accelerate growth and cultivate global capabilities to meet client demands the company acquired leading firms in investment management westmark realty advisors—now cb richard ellis investors in 1995 mortgage banking lj melody  company—now cbre melody in 1996 and property and corporate facilities management as well as capital markets and investment management koll real estate services in 1997 in 1996 cb commercial became a public company 

  

in 1998 the company then known as cb commercial real estate services group achieved significant global expansion with the acquisition of rei limited rei limited which traces its roots to london in 1773 was the holding company for all “richard ellis” operations outside of the united kingdom following the rei limited acquisition the company changed its name to cb richard ellis services inc and later in 1998 acquired the londonbased firm of hillier parker may  rowden one of the top property services firms operating in the united kingdom with these acquisitions we believe we became the first real estate services firm with a platform to deliver integrated real estate services across the world’s major business capitals through one commonlyowned commonlymanaged company 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which was initially known as blum cb holding corp and later as cbre holding inc was formed by an affiliate of blum capital partners lp as a delaware corporation on february 20 2001 for the purpose of acquiring all of the outstanding stock of cb richard ellis services in a 

  

“going private” transaction this transaction which involved members of our senior management team and affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co was completed in 2001 

  

in july 2003 our global position was further solidified as our whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis services and insignia financial group inc were brought together to form a premier worldwide fullservice real estate services company as a result of the insignia acquisition we operate globally under the “cb richard ellis” brand name which we believe is a wellrecognized brand in virtually all of the world’s key business centers in order to enhance our financing flexibility and to provide liquidity for some of our stockholders in june 2004 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock on december 13 2004 and november 15 2005 we completed secondary public offerings that provided further liquidity for some of our stockholders 

  

in december 2006 we completed the acquisition of trammell crow company our largest acquisition to date which deepened our outsourcing services offerings for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management solutions across geographies and established people resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

beginning in 2005 and continuing throughout 2007 we have supplemented our global capabilities through the acquisition of regional and specialtyniche firms that are leaders in their areas of concentration or in their local markets including regional firms with which we had previous affiliate relationships these “infill” acquisitions remain an integral part of our strategy 

  

our corporate structure 

  

cb richard ellis group inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries cb richard ellis services inc our direct whollyowned subsidiary is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness including our senior secured term loan facilities obtained to finance the acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

in our americas segment most of our advisory services and outsourcing services operations are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis inc our mortgage loan origination and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre melody and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are primarily conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis limited 

  

in our europe middle east and africa or emea segment operations are conducted through a number of indirect whollyowned subsidiaries the most significant of such subsidiaries include cb richard ellis ltd the united kingdom cb richard ellis holding sas france cb richard ellis gmbh germany cb richard ellis sa spain cb richard ellis bv the netherlands and cb richard ellis ireland 

  

in our asia pacific segment operations are primarily conducted through a number of indirect whollyowned subsidiaries including cb richard ellis pty ltd australia cb richard ellis ltd new zealand cb richard ellis ltd hong kong china and taiwan cb richard ellis korea co ltd korea and cb richard ellis pte ltd singapore as well as a majority ownership in cb richard ellis kk japan and cb richard ellis south asia pte ltd india 

  

operations in our global investment management segment are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis investors llc and its global affiliates which we also refer to as cbre investors 

  

operations in our development services segment are conducted through our indirect whollyowned subsidiaries trammell crow company trammell crow services inc and certain of its subsidiaries 

  

industry overview 

  

our business covers all aspects of the commercial real estate services industry including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales commercial property and corporate facilities management valuation real estate investment management development services commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions and proprietary research 

  

we review on a quarterly basis various internallygenerated statistics and estimates regarding both office and industrial space within the us commercial real estate services industry including the total available “stock” of rentable space and the average rent per square foot of space our management believes that changes in the addressable commercial rental market represented by the product of available stock and rent per square foot provide a reliable estimate of changes in the overall commercial real estate services industry because nearly all segments within the industry are affected by changes in these two measurements we estimate that the product of available stock and rent per square foot grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 42 from 1997 through 2007 

  

we believe the current key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services companies are primarily 1 the continued outsourcing of commercial real estate services 2 the consolidation of clients’ activities with fewer providers 3 the increasing institutional ownership of commercial real estate 4 healthy occupier market fundamentals 5 acquisition opportunities and 6 attracting and retaining talent 

  

outsourcing 

  

motivated to reduce costs lower overhead improve execution across markets increase operational efficiency and focus more closely on their core competencies property owners and occupiers have been increasingly contracting out for their commercial real estate services including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

consolidation 

  

we believe that major property owners and corporate users are motivated to consolidate their service provider relationships on a regional national and global basis to obtain more consistent execution across markets to achieve economies of scale and to benefit from streamlined management oversight and the efficiency of single 

  

point of contact service delivery as a result we believe large owners and occupiers are awarding an increasing share of this business to larger real estate services providers particularly those that provide a full suite of services across geographical boundaries 

  

institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

institutional owners such as real estate investment trusts or reits pension funds foreign institutions and other financial entities increasingly have been acquiring more real estate assets many institutional investors have been allocating a higher percentage of their capital to real estate in order to diversify their investment portfolios and these investments often generate higher currentcash yields than is available with alternative investments total us real estate assets held by institutional owners increased to 719 billion in 2007 from 320 billion in 1997 reits were the main drivers of this growth during this period with an increase of approximately 263 foreign institutions increased their us real estate holdings by approximately 90 over this period while pension funds increased their holdings by approximately onethird we believe it is likely that many of these owners will outsource management of their portfolios and consolidate their use of real estate services vendors 

  

healthy occupier market fundamentals 

  

a worldwide economic expansion has produced healthy occupier market fundamentals in major cities across the globe demand for real estate especially office space has increased while commercial construction has generally remained subdued compared with historic standards this trend has contributed to positive absorption low vacancy rates and improved rental rates healthy occupier market fundamentals remain the norm despite the us economic slowdown in 2007 

  

acquisition opportunities 

  

revenue growth and market share gains can be achieved through the strategic acquisition of local and regional service firms as well as those specializing in specific market niches we believe the opportunities to make additional acquisitions will increase due to the softer leasing and investment sales environment firms that are dependent on a single geographic market or limited service specialties will find it more difficult to compete in a softer market and will be attracted to a broader and more diversified global platform 

  

attracting and retaining talent 

  

attracting and retaining the best real estate services professionals is fundamental to a successful growth strategy a broad global platform strong brand and local market leadership position a company well to draw top professionals away from smaller less diversified firms this is especially true during periods of slower market activity investing heavily in the continuous training development and skillenhancement of existing professionals is key to success in this area 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

we report our results of operations through five segments 1 the americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services 

  

information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of our segments is included in “segment operations” within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section and within note 25 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in note 25 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

the americas 

  

the americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the united states and in the largest metropolitan regions in canada and selected parts of latin america through both whollyowned operations as well as affiliated offices our americas segment accounted for 611 of our 2007 revenue 622 of our 2006 revenue and 680 of our 2005 revenue within our americas segment we organize our services into the following business areas

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we also believe we invest in greater support resources than most other firms for example we believe our professional development and training programs are the most extensive in the industry in addition we invest heavily in gathering market information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to them through our commercial real estate market information and forecasting unit cbre torto wheaton research cbre torto wheaton research provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including twr outlook reports for the office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering more than 50 us metropolitan areas and the twr select office and industrial database covering over 288000 commercial properties 

  

   

our investment properties business which includes office industrial retail multifamily and hotel properties is one of the largest investment sales property advisors in the united states with a market share of approximately 166 in 2007 our us investment sales activity grew by approximately 25 during 2007 versus an increase of approximately 24 for the us market as a whole cbre melody our whollyowned subsidiary originates and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms national banks credit companies insurance companies pension funds and government agencies cbre melody’s 250 billion mortgage loan origination volume in 2007 represents an increase of 21 from 2006 approximately 24 billion of loans were originated for federal government sponsored entities most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose loans financed through the revolving credit lines generally occur with principal risk that is substantially mitigated because cbre melody obtains a contractual purchase commitment from the government sponsored entity before it actually originates the loan in 2007 gemsa loan services a joint venture between cbre melody and ge capital real estate serviced approximately 1105 billion of mortgage loans 608 billion of which relate to the servicing rights of cbre melody

our competitive position 

  

we believe we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the positive trends in the commercial real estate services industry which include healthy leasing fundamentals increased outsourcing consolidation of service providers and higher capital allocations to real estate on the part of institutional owners our strengths include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these strengths will create significant opportunities for our business you should also be aware of the risks that may impact our competitive position which include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

our growth strategy 

  

we believe we have built the premier integrated global services platform in our industry which gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing this integrated global services platform we acquired such entities as the koll company westmark realty advisors now known as cbre investors lj melody  company now known as cbre melody rei limited and hillier parker may  rowden during the 1990s insignia in 2003 and trammell crow company in 2006 which added strength expertise and resources in comprehensive outsourcing services integrated account management and real estate development today we believe that we offer the commercial real estate services industry’s most complete suite of services and that we have a leadership position in many of the top business centers around the world our primary business objective is to leverage this platform on a global basis in order to garner an increasing share of industry revenues relative to our competitors we believe this will enable us to maximize our longterm cash flow sustain our competitive advantage and increase longterm stockholder value our strategy to achieve these business objectives consists of several elements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales commercial property and corporate facilities management valuation real estate investment management development services commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions and proprietary research each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2007 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services 

  

depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield and jones lang lasalle as well as national firms such as grubb  ellis 

  

different factors weigh heavily in the competition for clients in advisory services key differentiating factors include quality service resource depth demonstrated track record brand reputation analytical skills market knowledge strategic thinking and creative problemsolving these factors are also vital in outsourcing services and are supplemented by consistency of execution across markets economies of scale enhanced efficiency and cost reduction strategies in investment management the ability to enhance asset value and produce solid consistent returns on invested capital are keys to success 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2007 we had over 29000 employees worldwide excluding affiliate offices at december 31 2007 482 of these employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements most of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business accounts in the new yorknew jersey and illinois areas we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cb richard ellis” the “cbre” the “cbre melody” and the “trammell crow” names with respect to the cb richard ellis cbre and cbre melody names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cb richard ellis and cbre related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them the us patent  trademark office published our application for the trade name “cbre melody” in 2007 and if registered in 2008 this mark would expire in 2017 if we failed to renew it 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which is whollyowned by certain descendents and affiliates of mr trammell crow see “risk factors—we license the use of the trammell crow trade name and this license is not exclusive and may be revoked” for additional information 

  

in addition to trade names we have developed proprietary technology for preparing and developing valuation reports to our clients through our valuation business and we offer proprietary research to clients through our cbre torto wheaton research unit we also offer proprietary investment structures through cbre investors while we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business in the aggregate 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property 

  

such liability may be imposed without regard for the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and such liability may be joint and several with any other parties that are deemed legally liable for the contamination the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials if the liability is joint and several we could be responsible for payment of the full amount of the liability whether or not any other responsible party is also liable under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site for costs that a governmental entity incurs in connection with the contamination 

  

some of the properties owned operated or managed by us are in the vicinity of properties which are currently or have been the site of releases of regulated substances and remediation activity and we are currently aware of several properties owned operated or managed by us which may be impacted by regulated substances which may have migrated from adjacent or nearby properties or which may be within the borders of areas suspected to be impacted by regional groundwater contamination 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at several properties owned operated or managed by us which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development businesses which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make 

  

recent adverse developments in the credit markets and the risk of continued market deterioration have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our capital markets business which includes debt and equity financing services is sensitive to the cost and availability of credit and liquidity in the credit markets additionally all of our businesses are susceptible to the volume of activity in the commercial real estate market the credit markets have recently experienced largely unexpected dislocations and liquidity disruptions these disruptions have reduced the availability and increased the cost of significant sources of funding in some cases these sources have been eliminated 

  

disruptions in the credit markets may adversely affect our business of providing advisory services to owners investors and occupiers of real estate in connection with the leasing disposition and acquisition of property if our clients are unable to procure credit on favorable terms there may be fewer completed leasings dispositions and acquisitions of property during 2007 we generated approximately 123 of our revenue from us investment property sales and financing activities 

  

we believe that the scope of recent disruptions in the credit markets has been unusual and that many market participants did not fully anticipate them as a result the magnitude or duration of the current credit market dislocations and liquidity disruptions are impossible to predict this limits our ability to plan for future developments and we believe that it limits the ability of other participants in the credit markets and commercial real estate markets to do so as well this uncertainty may lead market participants to plan and act more conservatively than in recent history which may amplify decreases in demand in the markets we service we also cannot predict whether the current market deterioration has led to or may lead to a recession in the commercial real estate industry or in the other sectors of the us economy or internationally 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business could be harmed in the event of an economic slowdown or recession or a downturn in the real estate market 

  

periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can reduce volumes for many of our business lines these economic conditions could result in a general decline in acquisition disposition and leasing activity as well as a general decline in the value of real estate and in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from 

  

property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets because our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

during an economic downturn it may also take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or the selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the carrying value of our real estate investments may become impaired and we could record losses as a result of such impairment or we could experience reduced profitability related to declines in real estate values further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations although we paid down our highinterest debt in 2006 we borrowed approximately 21 billion under our new senior secured term loan facilities in december 2006 of which 18 billion is outstanding as of december 31 2007 to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company for 2008 our estimated interest expense is approximately 1560 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do 

  

we are able to incur more indebtedness which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

our current amended and restated credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facilities permits us subject to specified conditions to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness including up to 6000 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility of which 2271 million was drawn as of december 31 2007 and 3000 million of additional debt under our senior secured term loan facilities subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted in our bank covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities subject to certain covenants in our various bank loan agreements we are also not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt cbre melody  company may incur in connection with funding loan originations for multifamily properties having prior purchase commitments by a government sponsored entity 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our amended and restated credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions will affect and in many respects will limit or prohibit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries’ abilities to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our amended and restated credit agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

the restrictions contained in our debt instruments could 

  

   

   

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured term loan facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our senior secured term loan facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under the senior secured term loan facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under the senior secured term loan facilities were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured term loan facilities the lenders under the senior secured term loan facilities could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facilities and the completion of our acquisition of trammell crow company the lenders under our senior secured term loan facilities received a pledge of all of our equity interests in our significant domestic subsidiaries including cb richard ellis services inc cbre investors cbre melody insignia cb richard ellis real estate services llc trammell crow company and cbre real estate services inc and 65 of the voting stock of our foreign subsidiaries that is held directly by us or our domestic subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our accounts receivable cash general intangibles investment property and future acquired material property as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured term loan facilities the lenders under the senior secured term loan facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and liquidate these assets 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including brett white our chief executive officer and president and kenneth j kay our chief financial officer messrs white and kay currently are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant majority of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals if any of our key employees leave including those acquired through acquisitions or we lose a significant number of key revenue producers and we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified support personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel competition for these personnel is intense and we may not be able to successfully recruit integrate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of insignia in july 2003 and our acquisition of trammell crow company in december 2006 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions which may not be available to us in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses for example through december 31 2007 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and 1966 million of transactionrelated 

  

expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures include severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 and the trammell crow company acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007 

  

if we acquire companies in the future we may experience integration costs and the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels in connection with the insignia acquisition we have incurred 407 million of expenses through december 31 2007 which are related to the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own additionally during the year ended december 31 2007 we have incurred 426 million of integration expenses associated with acquisitions completed in 2005 through 2007 including 396 million related to the acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

if we are unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we acquire we may not be able to effectively manage them moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states and as a result we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally during 2007 we generated approximately 372 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans to maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2007 approximately 372 of our business was transacted in currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee thus we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

our stock price is subject to volatility 

  

our stock price is affected by a number of factors including quarterly variations in our results and those of our competitors changes to the competitive landscape estimates and projections by the investment community the arrival or departure of key personnel the introduction of new services by us or our competitors and acquisitions strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors in addition the stock market in general has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations any of these factors may cause declines in the market price of our common stock when the market price of a company’s common stock drops significantly stockholders sometimes institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a securities class action lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources from our business 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services and facilities management lines of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2007 we had committed 956 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 512 million of these commitments will be funded during 2008 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments these adverse consequences could include damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors providing coinvestment financing is a very important part of cb richard ellis investors’ investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 70 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 525 million and 66 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us beyond being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable the estimated total budgeted project cost of these consolidated real estate projects is 9852 million in addition at december 31 2007 we were involved as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients in approximately 50 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries in which we had invested 926 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 77 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 61 million 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss risks associated with these activities include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other affiliations both in the united states and internationally and although we currently have no specific plans to do so we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial and operational resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and commercial mortgage brokerage with respect to each of our business disciplines we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2007 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours there has been a significant increase in recent years in real estate ownership by reits many of which selfmanage most of their real estate assets continuation of this trend could shrink the asset base available to be managed by thirdparty service providers and thereby decrease the demand for our services in general there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively to maintain current fee levels or margins or maintain or increase our market share 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed in the event of a future economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2007 and 2006 approximately 98 and 135 respectively of revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california any future economic downturn in the california commercial real estate market and in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations 

  

our results of operations vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year which makes comparisons of our quarterly results difficult 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter this variance among quarters during each calendar year makes comparison between such quarters difficult but does not generally affect the comparison of the same quarters during different calendar years

we have a license agreement with an affiliate of crow holdings that allows us to use the name “trammell crow” perpetually throughout the world in any business except the residential real estate business although we can use this name in serving certain mixeduse properties or in providing investment sales brokerage services to buyers and sellers of multifamily residential facilities this license can be revoked if we fail to maintain certain quality standards or infringe upon certain of the licensor’s intellectual property rights if we lose the right to use the trammell crow name our development services business could suffer significantly 

  

the license agreement permits certain existing uses of the name “trammell crow” by affiliates of crow holdings the use of the trammell crow name or other similar names by third parties may create confusion or reduce the value associated with the trammell crow name 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in our role as a real estate broker mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform in our business as well as laws of broader applicability such as tax securities and employment laws brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each us state in which we perform these services if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines including treble damages in certain states or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked in addition our indirect whollyowned subsidiary cbre investors is subject to laws and regulations as a registered investment advisor and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business as the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services claiming that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction and engineering services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of a supervisor we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of real estate brokerage or property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances liability under some of these laws may be joint and several meaning that one liable party could be held responsible for all costs related to a contaminated site despite the existence of other liable parties if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices as of december 31 2007 

  

   

these offices also include employees of our global investment management and development services segments the majority of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segment also contain employees of our other segments as a result offices of our global investment management and development services segments have not been separately included above as to do so would be duplicative 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the length of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2007 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other types of commercial real estate as of december 31 2007 excluding affiliate offices we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide with over 29000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales commercial property and corporate facilities management valuation real estate investment management development services commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions and proprietary research we generate revenues on a per project or transactional basis and from contractual management fees in 2006 we became the first commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 in 2007 we were ranked 520 on the fortune list of largest us companies 33 on the fortune list of 100 fastest growing us companies and 16 on the business week list of “best in class” companies 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are most crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for such variances in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies directly affect our operations as well as global and regional commercial real estate markets generally these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the availability of credit to finance transactions and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines weak economic conditions could result in a general decrease in transaction activity and a decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and from brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business 

  

adverse changes in economic conditions would also affect our compensation expense which is structured to decrease in line with any decrease in revenues compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions is partially mitigated in addition in circumstances when economic conditions are particularly severe our management can look to improve operational performance by reducing senior management bonuses curtailing capital expenditures and other cutting of discretionary operating expenses notwithstanding these approaches adverse global and regional economic changes remain one of the most significant risks to our future financial condition and results of operations 

  

beginning in 2003 economic conditions in the americas our largest segment in terms of revenue improved from the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002 which positively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused an improvement in our americas segment’s revenue particularly in leasing and sales revenue beginning in the third quarter of 2007 and continuing through yearend us economic activity began to 

  

weaken due to the softer housing sector more limited credit availability and higher oil prices weaker economic growth caused leasing activity to slow in some markets within the united states although most markets continued to exhibit positive fundamentals including low vacancies and rising rents us investment sales activity declined in the fourth quarter due to reduced availability of financing especially commercial mortgagebacked security debt for larger asset purchases and more conservative loan underwriting standards longer term the rebound of the us leasing and sales business will depend upon credit markets returning to more normalized conditions and the us economy resuming its growth 

  

the weakening trends experienced in the united states began to manifest themselves in the united kingdom in the latter part of 2007 this was evidenced by slower investment sales and leasing revenue growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2007 as compared with earlier in 2007 the markets in asia pacific remained strong throughout 2007 investment sentiment remained positive with continued strong demand from capital sources within asia as well as continued strong crossborder capital flows healthy economic growth underpinned strong leasing activity and rental growth across most of the asia pacific region 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world for example we enhanced our mortgage brokerage services through our 1996 acquisition of lj melody  company now known as cbre melody and we significantly increased the scale of our investment management business through our 1995 acquisition of westmark realty advisors now known as cb richard ellis investors our 1997 acquisition of koll real estate services and our 1998 acquisition of the londonbased firm hillier parker may  rowden our 2003 acquisition of insignia financial group inc insignia significantly increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services business lines in our americas segment and also significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas 

  

in december 2006 we completed our largest acquisition to date in acquiring trammell crow company the acquisition of trammell crow company deepened our offering of outsourcing services for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthened our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies and established people resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also been an integral component of our growth plans during the year ended december 31 2007 we completed 14 acquisitions with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 108 million these included the acquisition of the remaining 501 interest we did not already own in our us affiliate cbre technical services a building engineering services firm within our americas business segment which by being brought inhouse and combined with a similar business we acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition will strongly benefit us and the acquisition of a majority interest in cb richard ellis south asia pte ltd or cbre india an affiliate company within our asia pacific business segment that is a premier full service commercial real estate provider operating in the rapidly growing indian market in 2006 in addition to our acquisition of trammell crow company we completed 23 infill acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1550 million our acquirees were generally either quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform within a region or affiliates in which we already held an equity interest in addition these acquisitions exemplify our efforts to broaden our geographic coverage 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems 

  

into our own for example through december 31 2007 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition and 1966 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures included severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 and the trammell crow company acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2007 in addition through december 31 2007 we have incurred 407 million of expenses in connection with the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own 26 million of which was incurred during the year ended december 31 2007 additionally during the year ended december 31 2007 we incurred 426 million of integration expenses associated with other acquisitions completed in 2005 through 2007 including 396 million related to the acquisition of trammell crow company we expect to incur total integration expenses of approximately 160 million during 2008 which include residual insigniarelated integration costs integration costs associated with our acquisition of trammell crow company as well as similar costs related to our strategic infill acquisitions in 2005 through 2007 

  

international operations 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates our management cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

on december 5 2006 in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company we successfully tendered substantially all of our remaining 9 3  4  senior notes due in 2010 with the remainder repaid in may of 2007 although we paid down our highinterest debt in 2006 we borrowed approximately 21 billion under our new senior secured term loan facilities in december 2006 to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company as a result we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations 

  

although our management believes that the incurrence of longterm indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness for example in june 2006 we entered into a new 6000 million revolving credit facility which fully replaced our former credit agreement on more favorable terms additionally we repaid 2860 million of our senior secured term loans during the year ended december 31 2007 our management generally expects to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

notwithstanding the actions described above however our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 104 “ revenue recognition in financial statements ” which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized 

  

   

   

   

   

our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine i at what point in time revenue is earned ii whether there are contingencies involved that would impact the timing of recognition of revenue and iii how and when such contingencies will be resolved the actual timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made the revenues of our business that are subject to the most judgment are our brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record real estate commissions on sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded in income once we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant while the remaining portions of the lease commission is earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy the existence of any significant future contingencies such as tenant occupancy results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

investment management and property management fees are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or profit generated by the entities managed and are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when 

  

the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees these participation interests are generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period 

  

we earn incentive development fees from our development services segment these fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee requires us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectibility our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these individual assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are fully evaluated for collectibility and fully provided for if deemed uncollectible historically our credit losses have been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary the equity attributable to minority shareholders’ interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our vies including coinvestments with our clients is based on financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 or fin 46r “ consolidation of variable interest entities—an interpretation of arb no 51 ” we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie under fin 46r based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary in a quantitative analysis we incorporate various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss to the extent of its investment or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt accounting for an investment using either the equity or cost method has no impact on the evaluation of impairment of the underlying investment under either method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

our acquisitions require the application of purchase accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 141 “ business combinations ” this results in tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities of the acquired entity being recorded at fair value the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 

  

in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination we use a variety of valuation methods including present value depreciated replacement cost market values where available and selling prices less costs to dispose we are responsible for determining the valuation of assets and liabilities and for the allocation of purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 

  

assumptions must often be made in determining fair values particularly where observable market values do not exist assumptions may include discount rates growth rates cost of capital royalty rates tax rates and remaining useful lives these assumptions can have a significant impact on the value of identifiable assets and accordingly can impact the value of goodwill recorded different assumptions could result in different values being attributed to assets and liabilities since these values impact the amount of annual depreciation and amortization expense different assumptions could also impact our statement of operations and could impact the results of future impairment reviews 

  

the majority of our goodwill balance has resulted from our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 other intangible assets include trademarks which were separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in the united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to the insignia acquisition and the trammell crow trade name separately identified as part of the trammell crow company acquisition to be used in providing development services both the trademarks and the trade names are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships management contracts loan servicing rights and franchise agreements which are all being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” requires us to perform at least an annual assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives based on assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information these assumptions and estimates developed by us may differ from actual results if different assumptions and estimates were used carrying values could be adversely impacted resulting in write downs that would adversely affect our earnings 

  

we perform an annual assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we also assess goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows we completed our required annual impairment tests as of october 1 2007 2006 and 2005 and determined that no impairment existed as of those dates 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2007 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 6862 million 110 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation cost capitalization and allocation disposition of real estate and discontinued operations 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of the sfas no144 “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of completed assets not expected to be disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date and land on which development activities have not yet commenced 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated 

  

as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis or market comparisons this determination of fair value and the amount if any of the impairment loss requires us to utilize judgments and estimates buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally 39 years tenant improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases land improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated over their estimated useful lives up to 15 years 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under sfas no 144 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment had we evaluated our assets differently the balance sheet classification of such assets depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize costs in accordance with sfas no 34 “ capitalization of interest costs ” and sfas no 67 “ accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties ” capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are complete which are timing decisions that require judgment costs capitalized under sfas no 67 include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made a difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically identified to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values relative allocations of the costs are changed as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land land improvements building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values in accordance with sfas no 141 and sfas no 142 the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of net lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both net lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to net lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense if we used different estimates in these valuations the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different as well as depreciation of the related building and land improvements 

  

disposition of real estate 

  

gains on disposition of real estate are recognized upon sale of the underlying project in accordance with sfas no 66 “ accounting for sales of real estate ” we evaluate each real estate sale transaction to determine if it qualifies for gain recognition under the full accrual method this evaluation requires us to make judgments and 

  

estimates in assessing whether a sale has been consummated the adequacy of the buyer’s investment the subordination or collectibility of any receivable related to the purchase and whether we have transferred the usual risks and rewards of ownership to the buyer with no substantial continuing involvement by us if the transaction does not meet the criteria for the full accrual method of profit recognition based on our assessment we account for the sale based on an appropriate deferral method determined by the nature and extent of the buyer’s investment and our continuing involvement in some cases a deferral method could require the real estate asset and its related liabilities to remain on our balance sheet until the sale qualifies for a different deferral method or full accrual profit recognition 

  

discontinued operations 

  

sfas no 144 extends the reporting of a discontinued operation to a “component of an entity” and further requires that a component be classified as a discontinued operation if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in the disposal transaction and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component after the disposal transaction as defined in sfas no 144 a “component of an entity” comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity because each of our real estate assets is generally accounted for in a discrete subsidiary many constitute a component of an entity under sfas no 144 increasing the likelihood that the disposition of assets are required to be recognized and reported as operating profits and losses on discontinued operations in the periods in which they occur the evaluation of whether the component’s cash flows have been eliminated and the level of our continuing involvement requires judgment by us and a different assessment could result in items not being reported as discontinued operations 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “ accounting for income taxes ” deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 

  

effective january 1 2007 we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 48 “ accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standard no 109 ” or fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return the cumulative effect of applying this interpretation has resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of approximately 291 million and a decrease to goodwill of approximately 54 million prior to january 1 2007 we estimated uncertain income tax obligations in accordance with sfas no 109 and sfas no 5 “ accounting for contingencies ” 

  

accounting for tax positions requires judgments including estimating reserves for potential uncertainties we also assess our ability to utilize tax attributes including those in the form of carryforwards for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements we do not record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we believe will be realized in future periods while we believe the resulting tax balances as of december 31 2007 and 2006 are appropriately accounted for in accordance with sfas no 109 fin 48 and sfas no 5 as applicable the ultimate outcome of such matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and such adjustments could be material see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes

recent significant acquisitions 

  

on december 20 2006 pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated october 30 2006 the trammell crow company acquisition agreement by and among us a2 acquisition corp a delaware corporation and our whollyowned subsidiary merger sub and trammell crow company the merger sub was merged with and into trammell crow company the trammell crow company acquisition trammell crow company was the surviving corporation in the trammell crow company acquisition and upon the closing of the trammell crow company acquisition became our indirect whollyowned subsidiary 

  

the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 include the consolidated financial statements of trammell crow company from december 20 2006 the date of the trammell crow company acquisition as such our consolidated financial statements after the trammell crow company acquisition are not directly comparable to our consolidated financial statements prior to the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

segment reporting 

  

we report our operations through five segments the segments are as follows 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services the americas consists of operations located in the united states canada and latin america emea mainly consists of operations in europe while asia pacific includes operations in asia australia and new zealand the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in the united states europe and asia the development services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states which were acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

  

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the performance of our various business lines and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our performance under our employee incentive programs 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt 

  

instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda is calculated as follows 

  

         

year ended december 31 2007 compared to year ended december 31 2006 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 3905 million for the year ended december 31 2007 on revenue of 60 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 3186 million on revenue of 40 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 20 billion or 497 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this improvement was due to organic growth and acquisitions completed during 2006 and 2007 particularly the acquisition of trammell crow company in december of 2006 the revenue growth was fueled by continued higher worldwide transaction revenue as well as increased activity in our outsourcing and appraisalvaluation operations additionally enhanced performance from our global investment management business contributed to the increase foreign currency translation had a 1615 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2007 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 11 billion or 517 during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenue also contributing to the increase was an increase in reimbursable expenses as well as additional headcount both of which mainly resulted from acquisitions foreign currency translation had a 766 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2007 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 524 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 530 for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily attributable to our mix of revenue 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 20 billion an increase of 6849 million or 525 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide payrollrelated costs including bonuses which resulted from our improved operating performance also contributing to the increase were higher costs as a result of acquisitions particularly our acquisition of trammell crow company as well as increased marketing costs in support of our growing revenue these increases were partially offset by lower carried interest expense foreign currency translation had a 520 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2007 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from 323 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 330 for the year ended december 31 2007 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the current year were negatively impacted by higher integration costs in the current year primarily driven by the trammell crow company acquisition and bonus expense in our development services segment that primarily relates to gains on disposition of real estate which are not included in revenue excluding the impact of these items operating expenses as a percentage of revenue would actually be lower for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 457 million or 676 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily driven by higher amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition including net revenue backlog as of december 31 2007 the intangible asset representing the net revenue backlog acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition was fully amortized also contributing to the increase over the prior year was higher depreciation expense mainly resulting from fixed assets acquired in recent acquisitions 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 569 million for the year ended december 31 2007 these charges primarily consisted of severance and lease termination costs which were attributable to the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

our gain on disposition of real estate on a consolidated basis was 243 million for the year ended december 31 2007 these gains resulted from activity within our development services segment 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 316 million or 950 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this was primarily due to equity income generated by our development services segment 

  

our consolidated minority interest expense increased by 58 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was primarily due to minority interest associated with our japanese affiliate cb richard ellis kk or ikoma 

  

our other loss on a consolidated basis was 375 million for the year ended december 31 2007 which primarily related to the sale of trammell crow company’s approximately 19 ownership interest in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom this sale resulted in a pretax loss of 349 million which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to december 31 2006 when the investment was marked to market 

  

our consolidated interest income was 290 million an increase of 192 million or 1953 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was mainly driven by interest income earned in our americas segment primarily resulting from higher average cash balances in 2007 as a result of cash received on the sale of trammell crow company’s interest in savills plc as well as interest income earned on restricted cash held related to former shareholders of trammell crow company common stock see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements also contributing to the positive variance was interest income earned in our emea segment resulting from higher average cash balances in 2007 as well as higher interest income in our development services segment 

  

our consolidated interest expense increased 1180 million or 2621 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the overall increase was primarily due to the additional debt resulting from the trammell crow company acquisition despite the significant increase in our leverage as a result of the trammell crow company acquisition our management generally expects to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future for example we repaid 2860 million of our senior secured term loans during the year ended december 31 2007 we expect that annual interest expense for 2008 will be approximately 1560 million 

  

our loss on extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 338 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this loss was primarily related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the repurchase of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes during the year ended december 31 2006 in addition during the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 116 million of losses related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees as well as premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of our 9 3  4  senior notes and 82 million of losses in connection with the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with our prior credit facility which was replaced during 2006 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 1926 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1983 million for the year ended december 31 2006 our effective tax rate decreased from 384 for the year ended december 31 2006 to 332 for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease in both the provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate is primarily a result of the change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings as well as the reversal of a reserve for an uncertain tax position in the current year which we determined was no longer required 

  

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 3186 million for the year ended december 31 2006 on revenue of 40 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 2173 million on revenue of 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 8380 million or 262 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 over twothirds of the improvement was due to organic growth while the remainder was attributable to acquisitions completed during 2005 and 2006 the organic revenue growth was primarily driven by continued higher worldwide transaction revenue as well as increased appraisalvaluation mortgage brokerage and property and facilities management fees additionally carried interest revenue earned and higher fees generated in our global investment management business contributed to the increase foreign currency translation had a 281 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 3570 million or 204 during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenue also contributing to the increase was additional headcount which primarily resulted from acquisitions foreign currency translation had a 91 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2006 cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased from 549 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 524 for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily attributable to our mix of revenue with a higher composition of revenue being noncommissionable or earned from markets with lower cost of services 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 13 billion an increase of 2811 million or 275 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide payrollrelated costs including bonuses and carried interest incentive compensation expense as well as increased marketing costs which resulted from our improved operating performance also contributing to the increase were higher costs as a result of acquisitions 

  

particularly our acquisition of trammell crow company foreign currency translation had an 89 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2006 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were essentially flat at 323 for the year ended december 31 2006 versus 320 for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 221 million or 485 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily driven by higher amortization expense related to the intangible assets representing net revenue backlog and incentive fees acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition as of december 31 2006 the net book value of the intangible asset representing the remaining net revenue backlog acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition was 258 million which was fully amortized by the end of 2007 also contributing to the increase over the prior year was higher depreciation expense resulting from increased capital expenditures as well as fixed assets acquired in recent acquisitions 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by 51 million or 133 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this was primarily due to higher dispositions within selected funds in our global investment management segment in 2005 partially offset by higher equity income in our emea and americas segments for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our consolidated minority interest expense increased 40 million or 1829 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily due to minority interest associated with our japanese affiliate ikoma which we began fully consolidating in our results in 2006 as a result of our equity interest reaching 51 in 2006 

  

our other income on a consolidated basis was 86 million for the year ended december 31 2006 which represented income related to marking trammell crow company’s investment in savills plc to market for the period december 20 2006 the date of the trammell crow company acquisition through december 31 2006 

  

our consolidated interest income was 98 million for the year ended december 31 2006 a decrease of 14 million or 125 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this decrease was primarily driven by lower average cash balances in 2006 as a result of using cash to pay down debt as well as to fund acquisitions 

  

our consolidated interest expense decreased 113 million or 200 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the overall decline was primarily due to interest savings realized as a result of debt repayments made throughout 2005 and 2006 including the redemption of the remaining outstanding balance of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in june 2006 and the repayment of substantially all of our 9 3  4  senior notes in december 2006 in december 2006 we also entered into an amended and restated credit agreement covering two new senior secured term loan facilities for an aggregate principal amount of up to 22 billion of which we drew down 21 billion to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company 

  

our loss on extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 338 million and 74 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these losses were related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the repurchase of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 in addition during the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 116 million of losses related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees as well as premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of our 9 3  4  senior notes and 82 million of losses in connection with the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with our prior credit facility which was replaced during the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 1983 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 1389 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in the provision for income taxes is attributable to the significant increase in pretax income over 2005 our effective tax rate declined 

  

from 390 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 384 for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of the change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings

americas 

  

revenue increased by 12 billion or 472 for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase was driven by acquisitions particularly our acquisition of trammell crow company and includes higher sales and lease transaction revenue and growth of our outsourcing revenues as well as increased activity in our appraisalvaluation operations foreign currency translation had a 172 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2007

development services 

  

the development services segment consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition on december 20 2006 this segment includes activity from the acquisition date through december 31 2006 including revenue of 88 million as well as operating administrative and other expenses of 61 million 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility included in the capital requirements that we expect to fund during 2008 are approximately 800 million of anticipated net capital expenditures the capital expenditures for 2007 are primarily comprised of information technology costs which are driven largely by computer replacements as well as costs associated with upgrading various servers and systems and leasehold improvements 

  

during 2003 and 2006 we required substantial amounts of new equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company absent extraordinary transactions such as these we historically have not needed sources of financing other than our internally generated cash flow and our revolving 

  

credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary transactions our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our current longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of two parts the first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness our management is unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if this cash flow is insufficient then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments if necessary would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the other primary component of our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are our obligations related to our deferred compensation plans and our uk pension plans pursuant to our deferred compensation plans a select group of our management and other highlycompensated employees have been permitted to defer receipt of some or all of their compensation until future distribution dates and have the deferred amount credited towards specified investment alternatives except for deferrals into stock fund units that provide for future issuances of our common stock the deferrals under the deferred compensation plans represent future cash payment obligations for us we currently have invested in insurance and mutual funds for the purpose of funding our future cash deferred compensation obligations in addition upon each distribution under the plans we receive a corresponding tax deduction for such compensation payment our uk subsidiaries maintain pension plans with respect to which a limited number of our uk employees are participants our historical policy has been to fund pension costs as actuarially determined and as required by applicable law and regulations during the year ended december 31 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom in connection with this change certain plan assets and liabilities were remeasured which resulted in an underfunded obligation of 342 million at december 31 2007 as compared to a 580 million underfunded obligation at december 31 2006 

  

we expect that any future obligations under our deferred compensation plans and pension plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations 

  

in january 2007 we sold trammell crow company’s approximately 19 ownership interest in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom at a 349 million net loss which was largely driven by stock price depreciation at the date of sale as compared to december 31 2006 when the investment was marked to market the disposition was effected through the sale of approximately 259 million shares of savills plc common stock the pretax proceeds from the sale net of selling costs totaled approximately 3110 million and have been used to reduce net indebtedness 

  

on november 7 2007 we announced a share repurchase program of up to 5000 million of our outstanding common stock which was authorized by our board of directors subsequently on november 28 2007 we announced an expansion of our share repurchase program in which our board of directors authorized the share repurchase of up to 6350 million of our outstanding shares of common stock which included the 5000 million previously authorized this share repurchase program was funded out of our cash flow from operations as well as our revolving credit facility 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 6482 million for the year ended december 31 2007 an increase of 2182 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the trammell crow company acquisition has impacted substantially all components of cash used in our operating activities which makes comparison against the same period in the prior year not meaningful however the sharp increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december 31 2007 was primarily driven by the approximately 3110 million in proceeds received from the sale of the approximately 19 ownership in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom held by trammell crow company furthermore higher results and distributions of earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries partially offset by higher income taxes paid also contributed to the increase 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 4300 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of 704 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily due to improved operating performance experienced in 2006 in comparison to the year ended december 31 2005 which was evidenced by increases in net income income taxes paid compensation and employee benefits payable and accrued bonuses and profit sharing offset by an increase in accounts receivable this net increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was partially offset by higher deposits in the united kingdom primarily made to replace a letter of credit requirement related to one of our leases as well as an increase in prepaid compensation in 2006 lastly the new presentation of incremental tax benefits resulting from stock options exercised as financing inflows in 2006 as a result of our adoption of sfas no 123—revised “share based payment” versus operating inflows in 2005 also partially offset the overall increase 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2844 million for the year ended december 31 2007 a decrease of 18 billion as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease was primarily due to the use of less cash for acquisitions in the current year partially offset by the usage of cash to purchase real estate held for investment and higher capital expenditures 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 representing an increase of 19 billion as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily due to the use of cash for acquisitions particularly our acquisition of trammell crow company also contributing to the net increase in 2006 was an increase in restricted cash as well as higher capital expenditures the increase in restricted cash represents funds set aside to cover deferred purchase consideration relative to the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 2773 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 the proceeds of 21 billion from our senior secured term loans received in the prior year to fund the trammell crow company acquisition as well as our repurchase of 6350 million of common stock in the current year mainly contributed to this variance these items were partially offset by the repayment of debt in the prior year increased net borrowings under our revolving credit facility in the current year as well as current year activities within our development services segment including an increase in minority interest contributions higher net proceeds received from notes payable on real estate and shortterm borrowings related to a revolving line of credit 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 14 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 473 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by the debt financing required by the 

  

trammell crow company acquisition net of associated deferred financing fees this increase was partially offset by repayment of debt including the remaining outstanding balance of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes a substantial majority of the remaining outstanding balance of our 9 3  4  senior notes as well as the repayment of our prior senior secured term loan 

  

summary of contractual obligations and other commitments 

  

the following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of december 31 2007 

  

  

        

      

indebtedness 

  

our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

most of our longterm indebtedness was incurred in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in july 2001 the insignia acquisition in july 2003 and the trammell crow company acquisition in december 2006 the cb richard ellis services acquisition which was a going private transaction involving members of our senior management affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co and some of our other existing stockholders was undertaken so that we could take advantage of growth opportunities and focus on improvements in the cb richard ellis services businesses the insignia acquisition increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services businesses as well as significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas the trammell crow company acquisition has expanded our global leadership and strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management and comprehensive real estate services for our clients

deferred compensation plan obligations 

  

we have four deferred compensation plans or dcps the first which we refer to as the preaugust 2004 dcp has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals the second which we refer to as the postaugust 2004 dcp became effective on august 1 2004 and began accepting deferrals on august 13 2004 the third which we refer to as the restoration plan and was assumed by us in connection with our acquisition of insignia has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals the fourth which we refer to as the trammell crow company dcp was adopted by the trammell crow company effective january 1 2006 was assumed by us in connection with the trammell crow company acquisition and was merged into the postaugust 2004 dcp effective january 1 2008 because a substantial majority of the deferrals under our deferred compensation plans have distribution dates based upon the end of a relevant participant’s employment with us we have an ongoing obligation to make distributions to these participants as they leave our employment in addition participants currently may receive unscheduled inservice withdrawals of amounts deferred prior to january 1 2005 subject to a 75 penalty as the level of employee departures or inservice distributions is not predictable the timing of these obligations also is not predictable accordingly we may face significant unexpected cash funding obligations in the future if inservice distributions are greater than we expect or participants leave our employment sooner than we expect 

  

preaugust 2004 dcp 

  

prior to amending the preaugust 2004 dcp as discussed below each participant in the preaugust 2004 dcp was allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ended or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date the investment alternatives available to participants included two interest index funds and an insurance fund in which gains and losses on deferrals are measured by one or more of approximately 80 mutual funds distributions with respect to the interest index and insurance fund accounts are made by us in cash in addition prior to july 2001 participants were entitled to invest their deferrals in stock fund units that are distributed as shares of our class a common stock as of december 31 2007 there were 3017150 outstanding stock fund units under the preaugust 2004 dcp all of which were vested our stock fund unit deferrals included in additional paidin capital totaled 58 million and 62 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

effective august 1 2004 we closed the preaugust 2004 dcp on august 13 2004 deferrals made by participants for the plan year 2004 were deposited in the postaugust 2004 dcp effective august 1 2004 no additional deferrals were permitted under the preaugust 2004 dcp existing account balances under the plan 

  

will be paid to participants in the future according to their existing deferral elections however currently all participants may make unscheduled inservice withdrawals of their account balances including the shares of class a common stock underlying stock fund units if they pay a penalty equal to 75 and the taxes due on the value of the withdrawal unscheduled inservice withdrawals continue to be permitted under this plan because it is grandfathered from the rules of new section 409a of the internal revenue code or irc 

  

postaugust 2004 dcp 

  

effective august 1 2004 we adopted the postaugust 2004 dcp which began accepting deferrals for compensation earned after august 13 2004 at adoption each participant’s original deferral election made for the plan year 2004 in the preaugust 2004 dcp was carried into the postaugust 2004 dcp participants were not allowed to make new deferral elections for the plan year 2004 

  

under the postaugust 2004 dcp each participant is allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ends or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date deferrals are credited at the participant’s election to one or more investment alternatives under the postaugust 2004 dcp which include a moneymarket fund and ten mutual fund investment options there is limited flexibility for participants to change distribution elections once made effective january 1 2005 the postaugust 2004 dcp conforms to all the provisions outlined in section 409a of the irc and therefore does not allow for unscheduled inservice distributions 

  

included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets is an accumulated nonstock liability for our preaugust 2004 dcp and postaugust 2004 dcp totaling 2827 million and 2283 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and assets in the form of insurance set aside to cover the liability of 2642 million and 2033 million as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively the current portion of the accumulated nonstock liability is 123 million and 74 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and is included in compensation and employee benefits payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  

restoration plan 

  

the restoration plan assumed in connection with the insignia acquisition has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals the restoration plan is being administered only for the purpose of making distributions when participants terminate employment remaining amounts in this plan are invested in one fund the restoration plan is unfunded and has an accumulated nonstock liability of 44 million and 42 million included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively 

  

trammell crow company dcp 

  

effective january 1 2006 trammell crow company established a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or trammell crow company dcp for certain key employees of trammell crow company a portion of the eligible employees’ compensation was permitted to be directed into the trammell crow company dcp the trammell crow company dcp is funded and included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is an accumulated nonstock liability of 35 million and 16 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and investments in trading securities set aside to cover the liability of 35 million and 16 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively effective january 1 2008 the trammell crow company dcp was merged into the postaugust 2004 dcp 

  

pension liability 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two contributory defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans 

  

our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover the shortfall during the year ended december 31 2007 we reached agreements with the active members of these plans to freeze future pension plan benefits in return the active members became eligible to enroll in the cbre group personal pension plan a defined contribution plan in the united kingdom 

  

in connection with this change we recorded a curtailment gain of 100 million during the third quarter of 2007 and certain plan assets and liabilities were remeasured the resulting underfunded status of our pension plans included in pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 342 million at december 31 2007 as compared to 580 million at december 31 2006 

  

we expect to contribute a total of 106 million to fund our pension plans for the year ending december 31 2008 

  

other obligations and commitments 

  

we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 180 million as of december 31 2007 excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our balance sheet related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs and indebtedness these letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the normal course of business of our development services segment as well as in connection with certain insurance programs the letters of credit expire at varying dates through november 2008 

  

we had guarantees totaling 69 million as of december 31 2007 excluding guarantees related to consolidated indebtedness and operating leases these guarantees primarily include a debt repayment guaranty of an unconsolidated subsidiary as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas the guarantee obligation related to the debt repayment guaranty of an unconsolidated subsidiary expires in december 2009 the other guarantees will expire at the end of each of the respective management agreements 

  

we have several other debt repayment guarantees of unconsolidated subsidiaries that are subject to the provisions of fin 45 “ guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others—an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34 ” we estimate that our likely exposure under these guarantees is not material on this basis we estimate that the fair value of these guarantees is equivalent to the amount necessary to secure the guarantees using letters of credit from a bank and the aggregate amount is nominal 

  

in addition at december 31 2007 we have numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects these guarantees are made by us in the normal course of business each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget however we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees these contracts are intended to pass the budget risk to such contractors while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 

  

from time to time we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects we do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business in connection with these activities we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect and also look to insurance policies that cover this work while there can be no assurance we do not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 2 to 5 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2007 we had committed 956 million to fund future coinvestments of which 512 million is expected to be funded during 2008 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

additionally an important part of our development services business strategy is to invest in unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal in most cases coinvesting with our clients as of december 31 2007 we had committed to fund 77 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries the entire 77 million is expected to be funded during 2008 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2007 approximately 372 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar the australian dollar and the indian rupee we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2007 foreign currency translation had a 1615 million positive impact on our total revenue and a 1286 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended when accounting for any such contracts in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency as of december 31 2006 we had two option agreements outstanding to purchase an aggregate notional amount of 1600 million british pounds sterling which were terminated in january 2007 in connection with the sale of trammell crow company’s investment in savills plc on january 22 2007 we entered into an option agreement to sell a notional amount of 500 million british pounds sterling which expired on december 27 2007 on april 2 2007 we entered into three options agreements including one to sell a notional amount of 170 million euros which expired on june 27 2007 the second option agreement was to sell a notional amount of 190 million euros and expired on september 26 2007 the third option agreement was to sell a notional amount of 380 million euros and expired on december 27 2007 on december 20 2007 we entered into a foreign currency exchange forward contract with a notional amount of 460 million british pounds sterling which expires on october 31 2008 included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were charges of 81 million for the year ended december 31 2007 resulting from net losses on foreign currency exchange option and forward contracts 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2007 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

  

     

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 62 basis points which would comprise approximately 10 of the weighted average interest rates of our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2007 the net impact would be a decrease of 144 million on pretax income and cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

we also have 4660 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2007 these notes have interest rates ranging from 54 to 87 with maturity dates extending through 2011 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 47 million 

  

from time to time we enter into interest rate cap agreements in order to limit our interest expense related to our notes payable on real estate these interest rate cap agreements are not designated as effective hedges under sfas no 133 and are therefore marked to market each period with the change in fair market value recognized in current period earnings there was no significant net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on interest rate cap agreements for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

estimated fair values for the term loans under our senior secured term loan facilities and our remaining longterm debt are not presented because we believe that they are not materially different from book value primarily because the substantial majority of this debt is based on variable rates 

  

on february 26 2007 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 14 billion and a maturity date of december 31 2009 the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities on march 20 2007 these interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 133 we incurred a loss on these interest rate swaps from the date we entered into the swaps up to the designation date of approximately 39 million which is included in other loss in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations there was no hedge ineffectiveness for the period from march 20 2007 through december 31 2007 as of december 31 2007 the fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was reflected as a 171 million liability and is included in other current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c we will prevent or timely detect unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2007 the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2007 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

  

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we have formally adopted a policy for disclosure controls and procedures that provides guidance on the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects and that all information required to be disclosed in the periodic reports submitted by us under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms as of the end of the period covered by this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures a disclosure committee consisting of the principal accounting officer general counsel chief communication officer senior officers of each significant business line and other select employees assisted the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer in this evaluation based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the securities exchange act rule 13a15c as of the end of the period covered by this report 

  

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

  

no changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

cb richard ellis history 

  

cb richard ellis marked its 100 th year of continuous operations in 2006 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake that company grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate services firms in the western united states during the 1940s in the 1960s and 70s the company expanded both its service portfolio and geographic coverage to become a fullservice provider with a growing presence throughout the united states 

  

in 1989 employees and thirdparty investors acquired the company’s operations to form cb commercial throughout the 1990s cb commercial moved aggressively to accelerate growth and cultivate global capabilities to meet client demands the company acquired leading firms in investment management westmark realty advisors—now cb richard ellis investors in 1995 mortgage banking lj melody  company—now cbre melody in 1996 and property and corporate facilities management as well as capital markets and investment management koll real estate services in 1997 in 1996 cb commercial became a public company

industry overview 

  

our business covers all aspects of the commercial real estate services industry including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales development services commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions property facilities and project management consulting valuation and appraisal services proprietary research and real estate investment management 

  

we review on a quarterly basis various internallygenerated statistics and estimates regarding both office and industrial space within the us commercial real estate services industry including the total available “stock” of rentable space and the average rent per square foot of space our management believes that changes in the addressable commercial rental market represented by the product of available stock and rent per square foot provide a reliable estimate of changes in the overall commercial real estate services industry because nearly all segments within the industry are affected by changes in these two measurements we estimate that the product of available stock and rent per square foot grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 43 from 1996 through 2006 

  

we believe the current key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services companies are primarily 1 improved leasing fundamentals 2 the continued outsourcing of commercial real estate services 3 the consolidation of clients’ activities with fewer providers and 4 the increasing institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

improved leasing fundamentals 

  

fueled by global economic expansion leasing markets around the world are in the midst of a strong recovery with occupier demand for real estate increasing and commercial construction remaining historically low many major markets have seen strong positive absorption and diminished vacancy rates in turn this has caused rental rates to improve materially 

  

outsourcing 

  

motivated by reduced costs lower overhead improved execution across markets increased operational efficiency and a desire to focus on their core competencies property owners and occupiers have increasingly contracted out for their commercial real estate services including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

consolidation 

  

we believe that major property owners and corporate users are motivated to consolidate their service provider relationships on a regional national and global basis to obtain more consistent execution across markets to achieve economies of scale and to benefit from streamlined management oversight and the efficiency of single point of contact service delivery as a result we believe large owners and occupiers are awarding an increasing share of this business to larger real estate services providers particularly those that provide a full suite of services across geographical boundaries 

  

institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

institutional owners such as real estate investment trusts or reits pension funds foreign institutions and other financial entities increasingly are acquiring more real estate assets and financing them in the capital markets many institutional investors are allocating a higher percentage of their capital to real estate particularly with borrowing costs low investors believe they can generate higher currentcash yields with real estate investments than with alternative investments gradually improving leasing market fundamentals ie higher occupancy increased rents also offer these investors the potential for rising future cashflow total us real estate assets held by institutional owners increased to 606 billion in 2006 from 254 billion in 1996 reits were the main drivers of this growth during this period with a portfolio increase of approximately 461 foreign institutions more than doubled their us real estate holdings over this period while pension funds increased their holdings by 47 we believe it is likely that many of these owners will outsource management of their portfolios and consolidate their use of real estate services vendors 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

we report our results of operations through five segments 1 the americas 2 europe middle east and africa or emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of an assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we also invest in greater support resources than most other firms for example we believe our professional development and training programs are the most extensive in the industry in addition we invest heavily in gathering market information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to clients through our torto wheaton research unit a leading provider of commercial real estate market information forecasting and consulting services torto wheaton research provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including twr outlook reports for the office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering more than 50 us metropolitan areas and the twr select office and industrial database covering over 276000 commercial properties

outsourcing services 

  

outsourcing is a longterm trend in commercial real estate with corporations institutions public sector entities and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of thirdparty real estate specialists our outsourcing services primarily include two business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend 1 asset services and 2 corporate services although our management agreements with our outsourcing clients generally may be terminated with notice ranging between 30 days to a year we have developed longterm relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships as of december 31 2006 we managed approximately 10 billion square feet of which 4748 million square feet is attributable to trammell crow company of commercial space for property owners and occupiers which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the americas despite the absolute growth in revenue generated from our outsourcing services business line from 2004 to 2006 revenue from this line as a percentage of total revenue generated by us for 2006 as compared to 2004 has declined with revenue from outsourcing representing 161 of our 2006 consolidated revenue includes activity of trammell crow company from december 20 2006 the date we acquired trammell crow company through december 31 2006 147 of our 2005 consolidated revenue and 174 of our 2004 consolidated revenue

our competitive position 

  

we believe we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the positive trends in the commercial real estate services industry including improved leasing fundamentals increased outsourcing consolidation of service providers and higher capital allocations to real estate on the part of institutional owners our strengths include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these strengths will create significant opportunities for our business you should also be aware of the risks that may impact our competitive position which include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our growth strategy 

  

we believe we have built the premier integrated global services platform in our industry which gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing this integrated global services platform we acquired such entities as the koll company westmark realty advisors now known as cbre investors lj melody  company now known as cbre melody rei limited and hillier parker may  rowden during the 1990s and insignia in 2003 in 2006 we acquired trammell crow company adding that company’s strength expertise and resources in comprehensive outsourcing services integrated account management and real estate development to our service offering today we believe that we offer the commercial real estate services industry’s most complete suite of services and that we have a leadership position in many of the top business centers around the world our primary business objective is to leverage this platform on a global basis in order to garner an increasing share of industry revenues relative to our competitors we believe this will enable us to maximize our longterm cash flow sustain our competitive advantage and increase longterm stockholder value our strategy to achieve these business objectives consists of several elements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services development services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and capital markets each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2006 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers 

  

inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield grubb  ellis and jones lang lasalle 

  

different factors weigh heavily in the competition for clients in advisory services key differentiating factors include quality service resource depth demonstrated track record analytical skills market knowledge strategic thinking and creative problemsolving these factors are also vital in outsourcing services and are supplemented by consistency of execution across markets economies of scale enhanced efficiency and cost reduction strategies in investment management the ability to enhance asset value and produce solid consistent returns on invested capital are keys to success 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2006 we had approximately 24000 employees worldwide which includes trammell crow company excluding affiliate and partner offices at december 31 2006 638 of these employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements the substantial majority of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business accounts in the new yorknew jersey area we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cb richard ellis” the “lj melody” and the “trammell crow” names with respect to the cb richard ellis and lj melody names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cb richard ellis related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cb richard ellis related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them we obtained our most recent us trademark registration for the lj melody name in 1997 and this registration would expire in 2007 if we failed to renew it 

  

we hold a license to use the “trammell crow” trade name pursuant to a license agreement with cf98 lp an affiliate of crow realty investors lp dba crow holdings which is wholly owned by certain descendents and affiliates of mr trammell crow see “risk factors—we license the use of the trammell crow trade name and this license is not exclusive and may be revoked” for additional information 

  

in addition to trade names we have developed proprietary technology for preparing and developing valuation reports to our clients through our valuation business and we offer proprietary research to clients through our torto wheaton research unit we also offer proprietary investment structures through cbre investors while we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental liabilities controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the ownership management development use or sale of commercial real estate certain of these laws and regulations may impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property including contamination resulting from aboveground or underground storage tanks at a property if contamination occurs or is present during our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable for such costs as a current “operator” of a property 

  

such liability may be imposed without regard for the legality of the acts or omissions that caused the contamination and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances and such liability may be joint and several with any other parties that are deemed legally liable for the contamination the operator of a site also may be liable under common law to third parties for damages and injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous substances or environmental contamination at a site including liabilities arising from exposure to asbestoscontaining materials if the liability is joint and several we could be responsible for payment of the full amount of the liability whether or not any other responsible party is also liable under certain laws and common law principles any failure by us to disclose environmental contamination at a property could subject us to liability to a buyer or lessee of the property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site for costs that a governmental entity incurs in connection with the contamination 

  

some of the properties owned operated or managed by us are in the vicinity of properties which are currently or have been the site of releases of regulated substances and remediation activity and we are currently aware of several properties owned operated or managed by us which may be impacted by regulated substances which may have migrated from adjacent or nearby properties or which may be within the borders of areas suspected to be impacted by regional groundwater contamination 

  

while we are aware of the presence or the potential presence of regulated substances in the soil or groundwater at several properties owned operated or managed by us which may have resulted from historical or ongoing activities on those properties we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management and development businesses which could adversely impact the results of operations of these business lines

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make 

  

the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of trammell crow company may not be realized  

  

we acquired trammell crow company with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits including among others enhanced revenues a strengthened market position crossselling opportunities cost savings certain tax benefits and operating efficiencies achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties including whether we successfully integrate trammell crow company and achieving expected synergies from combined operations failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating results 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business could be harmed in the event of an economic slowdown or recession 

  

periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can reduce volumes for many of our business lines these economic conditions could result in a general decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets because our development and investment strategy often entails making relatively modest investments alongside our investor clients our ability to conduct these activities depends in part on the supply of investment capital for commercial real estate and related assets 

  

an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business if our real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among our various business lines 

  

during an economic downturn it may also take longer for us to dispose of real estate investments or the selling prices may be lower than originally anticipated as a result the carrying value of our real estate investments may become impaired and we could record losses as a result of such impairment or we could experience reduced profitability related to declines in real estate values further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations although we paid down our highinterest debt in 2006 we borrowed approximately 22 billion under our new senior secured term loan facilities 

  

in december 2006 of which 21 billion has been drawn as of december 31 2006 to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company for 2007 our estimated interest expense is approximately 140 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do 

  

we are able to incur more indebtedness which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

our current amended and restated credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and our senior secured term loan facilities permits us subject to specified conditions to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness including up to 6000 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and 4000 million of additional debt under our senior secured term loan facilities subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

subject to the maximum amounts of indebtedness permitted in our bank covenants we are not restricted in the amount of additional recourse debt we are able to incur in connection with the financing of our development activities and we may in the future incur such indebtedness in order to decrease the amount of equity we invest in these activities 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including our amended and restated credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions will affect and in many respects will limit or prohibit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries’ abilities to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our amended and restated credit agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

the restrictions contained in our debt instruments could 

  

   

   

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured term loan facilities may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our senior secured term loan facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under the senior secured term loan facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under the senior secured term loan facilities were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured term loans the lenders under the senior secured term loans could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness under our senior secured term loan facilities and the completion of our acquisition of trammell crow company the lenders under our senior secured term loan facilities received a pledge of all of our equity interests in our significant domestic subsidiaries including cb richard ellis services inc cbre investors cbre melody insignia cb richard ellis real estate services llc trammell crow company and cbre real estate services inc and 65 of the voting stock of our foreign subsidiaries that is held directly by us or our domestic subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our accounts receivable cash general intangibles investment property and future 

  

acquired material property as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured term loan facilities the lenders under the senior secured term loan facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and liquidate these assets 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including brett white our chief executive officer and president and kenneth j kay our chief financial officer messrs white and kay currently are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant majority of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals if any of our key employees leave including those acquired through acquisitions or we lose a significant number of key revenue producers and we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our growth has benefited significantly from acquisitions which may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of insignia in july 2003 and most recently our acquisition of trammell crow company in december 2006 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions however future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses for example through december 31 2006 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and 1445 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures included severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 and expect to incur our final transaction expenditures with respect to the trammell crow company acquisition by the end of 2007 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2006 we generated approximately 376 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans to maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2006 approximately 376 of our business was transacted in currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar and the australian dollar thus we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position 

  

if we acquire companies in the future we may experience integration costs and the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels in connection with the insignia acquisition we have incurred 381 

  

million of expenses through december 31 2006 which are related to the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own 

  

if we are unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we acquire we may not be able to effectively manage them moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services and facilities management lines of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our real estate investment and coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our global investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2006 we had committed 673 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 414 million of these commitments will be funded during 2007 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments these adverse consequences could include damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors providing coinvestment financing is also a very important part of cb richard ellis investors’ investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

selective investment in real estate projects is an important part of our development services business strategy and there is an inherent risk of loss of our investment as of december 31 2006 we had 67 consolidated real estate projects with invested equity of 482 million and 174 million of notes payable on real estate that are recourse to us beyond being recourse to the singlepurpose entity that holds the real estate asset and is the primary obligor on the note payable the estimated total budgeted project cost of these consolidated real estate projects is 9429 million in addition at december 31 2006 we were involved as a principal in most cases 

  

coinvesting with one of our clients in approximately 40 unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries in which we had invested 549 million and had committed additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 128 million we also guaranteed notes payable of these unconsolidated subsidiaries of 61 million in addition we have loaned 210 million to entities that have underlying investments in real estate 

  

because the disposition of a single significant investment can impact our financial performance in any period our real estate investment activities could increase fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flow in many cases we have limited control over the timing of the disposition of these investments and the recognition of any related gain or loss risks associated with these activities include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other partnerships both in the united states and internationally and although we currently have no specific plans to do so we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and commercial mortgage brokerage with respect to each of our business disciplines we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2006 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers inhouse corporate real estate departments developers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting and consulting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours there has been a significant increase in recent years in real estate ownership by reits many of which selfmanage most of their real estate assets continuation of this trend would shrink the asset base available to be managed by thirdparty service providers decrease the demand for our services and thereby significantly increase our competition 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed in the event of a future economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2005 and 2006 approximately 165 and 135 respectively of revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california any future economic downturn in the california commercial real estate market and in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations 

  

our results of operations vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year which makes comparisons of our quarterly results difficult 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter this variance among quarters during each calendar year makes comparison between such quarters difficult but does not generally affect the comparison of the same quarters during different calendar years 

  

we license the use of the trammell crow trade name and this license is not exclusive and may be revoked 

  

we have a license agreement with an affiliate of crow holdings that allows us to use the name “trammell crow” perpetually throughout the world in any business except the residential real estate business although we can use this name in serving certain mixeduse properties or in providing investment sales brokerage services to buyers and sellers of multifamily residential facilities this license can be revoked if we fail to maintain certain quality standards or infringe upon certain of the licensor’s intellectual property rights if we lose the right to use the trammell crow name our development services business could suffer significantly 

  

the license agreement permits certain existing uses of the name “trammell crow” by affiliates of crow holdings the use of the trammell crow name or other similar names by third parties may create confusion or reduce the value associated with the trammell crow name 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to us in our role as a real estate broker mortgage broker propertyfacility manager or developer we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

we are subject to numerous federal state local and nonus laws and regulations specific to the services we perform and our business as well as laws of broader applicability such as tax securities and employment laws brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions and the provision of property management and valuation services require us to maintain applicable licenses in each us state in which we perform these services if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct these activities without a license or violate any of the regulations covering our licenses we may be required to pay fines or return commissions received or have our licenses suspended or revoked in addition our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cbre investors is subject to laws and regulations as a registered investment advisor and compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business as the size and scope of commercial real estate transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with numerous state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both within and outside of the united states also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to regulatory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales as well as building owners and companies for whom we provide management services claiming that we did not fulfill our regulatory and fiduciary obligations 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction and engineering services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of a supervisor we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of real estate brokerage or property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we may be subject to environmental liability as a result of our role as a property or facility manager or developer of real estate 

  

various laws and regulations impose liability on real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at a property in our role as a property or facility manager or developer we could be held liable as an operator for such costs this liability may be imposed without regard to the legality of the original actions and without regard to whether we knew of or were responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances if we fail to disclose environmental issues we could also be liable to a buyer or lessee of a property in addition some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs incurred in connection with the contamination if we incur any such liability our business could suffer significantly additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business 

  

our stock price is subject to volatility 

  

our stock price is affected by a number of factors including quarterly variations in our results and those of our competitors changes to the competitive landscape estimates and projections by the investment community the arrival or departure of key personnel the introduction of new services by us or our competitors and acquisitions strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors in addition the stock market in general has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations any of these factors may cause declines in the market price of our common stock when the market price of a company’s common stock drops significantly stockholders sometimes institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a securities class action lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources from our business

 item 1b unresolved staff comments 

  

not applicable 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices as of december 31 2006 

  

   

these offices also include employees of our global investment management and development services segments almost all of our offices that contain employees of our global investment management or our development services segment also contain employees of our other segments as a result offices of our global investment management and development services segments have not been included above as to do so would be duplicative 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the terms of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse 

  

movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business our management believes that any liability imposed on us that may result from disposition of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2006 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other commercial real estate assets as of december 31 2006 excluding affiliates and partner offices we operated in more than 300 offices worldwide with approximately 24000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name and development services under the “trammell crow” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales development services commercial mortgage origination and servicing capital markets equity and debt solutions commercial property and corporate facilities management valuation proprietary research and real estate investment management we generate revenues both on a per project or transaction basis and from annual management fees in 2006 we became the first commercial real estate services company included in the sp 500 and in both 2005 and 2006 were the only commercial real estate services company included in the fortune 1000 list of the largest us publiclyheld companies 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations and make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are most crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for such variances in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies directly affect our operations as well as global and regional commercial real estate markets generally these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the availability of credit to finance transactions and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines weak economic conditions could result in a general decrease in transaction activity and decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business if our real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among our various business lines 

  

for example beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2006 economic conditions in the united states improved from the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002 which positively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused an improvement in our americas segment’s revenue particularly in transaction revenue and we expect this trend to continue in the near term however in the event of a slowdown in the us economy our revenue growth could be negatively impacted 

  

adverse changes in economic conditions would also affect our compensation expense which is structured to decrease in line with any decrease in revenues compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions is partially mitigated in addition in circumstances when economic conditions are particularly severe our management can look to improve operational performance by reducing senior 

  

management bonuses curtailing capital expenditures and other cutting of discretionary operating expenses notwithstanding these approaches adverse global and regional economic changes remain one of the most significant risks to our future financial condition and results of operations 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world for example we enhanced our mortgage brokerage services through our 1996 acquisition of lj melody  company now known as cbre melody and we significantly increased the scale of our investment management business through our 1995 acquisition of westmark realty advisors now known as cb richard ellis investors and our 1997 acquisition of koll real estate services our 2003 acquisition of insignia financial group inc insignia significantly increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services business lines in our americas segment and also significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas 

  

in december 2006 we completed our largest acquisition to date as we acquired trammell crow company the acquisition of trammell crow company deepens our offering of outsourcing services for corporate and institutional clients especially project and facilities management strengthens our ability to provide integrated management solutions across geographies and establishes people resources and expertise to offer real estate development services throughout the united states 

  

strategic infill acquisitions have also been an integral component of our growth plans in 2005 we completed seven acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1000 million including our acquisitions of cb richard ellis gunne in ireland and dalgleish  company in the united kingdom both within our europe middle east and africa emea business segment in 2006 in addition to our acquisition of trammell crow company we completed 23 acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1550 million these included the acquisition of an additional stake in our japanese affiliate ikoma cb richard ellis kk or ikoma within our asia pacific business segment increasing our equity interest in ikoma to 51 the acquisition of our wisconsin affiliate the polacheck company within our americas business segment which enhanced our brand and market position in the us midwest and the acquisition of holley blake which augmented our position in the industrial and logistics sectors in the united kingdom these acquisitions are a good example of our efforts to broaden our geographic coverage our acquirees were generally either quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform or affiliates in which we already held an equity interest 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example through december 31 2006 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition and 1445 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 transactionrelated expenditures included severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 in addition through december 31 2006 we have incurred 381 million of expenses in connection with the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own 30 million of which were incurred during 2006 additionally during the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 46 million of integration expenses associated with other acquisitions completed in 2005 and 2006 we expect to incur total integration expenses of 

  

approximately 30 million during 2007 which include residual insigniarelated integration costs integration costs associated with our acquisition of trammell crow company as well as similar costs related to our strategic infill acquisitions in 2005 and 2006

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates our management cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

on june 15 2006 we redeemed all of our then outstanding 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due in 2011 on december 5 2006 in connection with our acquisition of trammell crow company we successfully tendered substantially all of our remaining 9 3  4  senior notes due in 2010 although we paid down our highinterest debt in 2006 we borrowed approximately 21 billion under our new senior secured term loan facilities in december 2006 to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company as a result we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations 

  

although our management believes that the incurrence of longterm indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisition of insignia and our acquisition of trammell crow company the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness for example in june 2006 we entered into a new 6000 million revolving credit facility which fully replaced our former credit agreement on more favorable terms despite the recent increase in our leverage our management generally expects to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

notwithstanding the actions described above however our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 104 “ revenue recognition in financial statements ” which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized 

  

   

   

   

   

our various revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria the judgments involved in revenue recognition include understanding the complex terms of agreements and determining the appropriate time to recognize revenue for each transaction based on such terms each transaction is evaluated to determine 1 at what point in time revenue is earned 2 whether there are contingencies involved that would impact the timing of recognition of revenue and 3 how and when such contingencies will be resolved the actual timing of revenue recognition could vary if different judgments were made the revenues of our business that are subject to the most judgment are our brokerage commission revenue and incentivebased management and development fees 

  

we record real estate commissions on sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded as income once we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant while the remaining portions of the lease commission is earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy the existence of any significant future contingencies such as tenant occupancy results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

investment management and property management fees are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or profit generated by the entities managed and are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees these participation interests are generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period 

  

we earn incentive development fees from our development services these fees are recognized when quantitative criteria have been met such as specified leasing or budget targets or for those incentive fees based on qualitative criteria upon approval of the fee by our clients certain incentive development fees allow us to share in the fair value of the developed real estate asset above cost this sharing creates additional revenue potential to us with no exposure to loss other than opportunity cost our incentive development fee revenue is not recognized to the extent that such revenue is subject to future performance contingencies but rather once the contingency has been resolved the unique nature and complexity of each incentive fee require us to use varying levels of judgment in determining the timing of revenue recognition 

  

pursuant to emerging issues task force or eitf issue no 0114 “ income statement characterization of reimbursements received for ‘out of pocket’ expenses incurred ” and eitf 9919 “ reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent ” our management concluded that the accounting for certain reimbursements primarily salaries and related charges related to our facilities and property management operations should be presented on a grossed up basis versus a net expense basis accordingly during the fourth quarter of 2006 we reclassified such reimbursements from cost of services to revenue for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 to be consistent with the presentation for the year ended december 31 2006 as a result amounts reflected as “revenue” and “cost of services” in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 have been increased from the amounts previously reported by 2834 million and 2820 million respectively this reclassification had no impact on operating income net income earnings per share or stockholders’ equity 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectibility our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these individual assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are fully provided for historically our credit losses have been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts those of our majorityowned subsidiaries as well as variable interest entities or vies in which we are the primary beneficiary and other subsidiaries of which we have control the equity attributable to minority shareholders’ interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

variable interest entities 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our vies including coinvestments with our clients is based on financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 or fin 46r “ consolidation of variable interest entities – an interpretation of arb no 51 ” we consolidate any vie of which we are the primary beneficiary and disclose significant vies of which we are not the primary beneficiary if any 

  

we determine if an entity is a vie under fin 46r based on several factors including whether the entity’s total equity investment at risk upon inception is sufficient to finance the entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support we make judgments regarding the sufficiency of the equity at risk based first on a qualitative analysis then a quantitative analysis if necessary in a quantitative analysis we incorporate various estimates including estimated future cash flows asset hold periods and discount rates as well as estimates of the probabilities of various scenarios occurring if the entity is a vie we then determine whether we consolidate the 

  

entity as the primary beneficiary this determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary includes any impact of an “upside economic interest” in the form of a “promote” that we may have a promote is an interest built into the distribution structure of the entity based on the entity’s achievement of certain return hurdles 

  

we determine whether an entity is a vie and if so whether it should be consolidated by utilizing judgments and estimates that are inherently subjective if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates in these evaluations it could result in differing conclusions as to whether or not an entity is a vie and whether or not to consolidate such entity 

  

limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting method with respect to our investments in limited partnerships limited liability companies and other subsidiaries is based on control for our general partner interests we are presumed to control and therefore consolidate the entity unless the other limited partners have substantive rights that overcome this presumption of control these substantive rights allow the limited partners to participate in significant decisions made in the ordinary course of the entity’s business we account for our noncontrolling general partner investments in these entities under the equity method this treatment also applies to our managing member interests in limited liability companies 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

our determination of the appropriate accounting treatment for an investment in a subsidiary requires judgment of several factors including the size and nature of our ownership interest and the other owners’ substantive rights to make decisions for the entity if we were to make different judgments or conclusions as to the level of our control or influence it could result in a different accounting treatment accounting for an investment as either consolidated or using the equity method generally would have no impact on our net income or stockholders’ equity in any accounting period but a different treatment would impact individual income statement and balance sheet items as consolidation would effectively “gross up” our income statement and balance sheet if our evaluation of an investment accounted for using the cost method was different it could result in our being required to account for an investment by consolidation or by the equity method under the cost method the investor only records its share of the underlying entity’s earnings to the extent that it receives dividends from the investee when the dividends received by the investor exceed the investor’s share of the investee’s earnings subsequent to the date of the investor’s investment the investor records a reduction in the basis of its investment under the cost method the investor does not record its share of losses of the investee conversely under either consolidation or equity method accounting the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity’s net income or loss to the extent of its investment or its guarantees of the underlying entity’s debt accounting for an investment using either the equity or cost method has no impact on the evaluation of impairment of the underlying investment under either method impairment losses are recognized upon evidence of otherthantemporary losses of value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid by us over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of acquired businesses with the majority of the balance resulting from our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and our acquisition of trammell crow company in 2006 other intangible assets include trademarks which were separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in the united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to 

  

the insignia acquisition and the trammell crow trade name separately identified as part of the trammell crow company acquisition to be used in providing development services both the trademarks and the trade names are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives the remaining other intangible assets primarily include customer relationships backlog management contracts loan servicing rights and franchise agreements which are all being amortized on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” requires us to perform at least an annual assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives based on assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information these assumptions and estimates developed by us may differ from actual results if different assumptions and estimates were used carrying values could be adversely impacted resulting in write downs that would adversely affect our earnings 

  

we perform an annual assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment based in part on a thirdparty valuation as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we also assess goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows we completed our required annual impairment tests as of october 1 2006 2005 and 2004 and determined that no impairment existed as of those dates 

  

real estate 

  

as of december 31 2006 the carrying value of our total real estate assets was 4599 million 77 of total assets the significant accounting policies and estimates with regard to our real estate assets relate to classification and impairment evaluation and cost capitalization and allocation 

  

classification and impairment evaluation 

  

with respect to our real estate assets sfas no 144 “ accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets ” establishes criteria to classify an asset as “held for sale” assets included in real estate held for sale include only completed assets or land for sale in its present condition that meet all of the sfas no 144 “held for sale” criteria all other real estate assets are classified in one of the following line items in our consolidated balance sheet i real estate under development current which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date ii real estate under development noncurrent which includes real estate that we are in the process of developing that is expected to be completed and disposed of more than one year from the balance sheet date or iii real estate held for investment which consists of completed assets not expected to be disposed of within one year of the balance sheet date and land on which development activities have not yet commenced 

  

real estate held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less cost to sell if an asset’s fair value less cost to sell based on discounted future cash flows or market comparisons is less than its carrying amount an allowance is recorded against the asset determining an asset’s fair value and the related allowance to record requires us to utilize judgment and estimates 

  

real estate under development and real estate held for investment are carried at cost less depreciation as applicable when indicators of impairment are present real estate under development and real estate held for investment are evaluated for impairment and losses are recorded when undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by an asset are less than the asset’s carrying amount the amount of the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value which is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis or market comparisons this determination of fair value and the amount if any of the impairment loss requires us to utilize judgments and estimates buildings and improvements included in real estate held for investment are depreciated using the straightline method over estimated useful lives generally 39 years tenant 

  

improvements included in real estate held for investment are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the terms of the respective leases 

  

we evaluate each of our real estate assets on a quarterly basis in order to determine the classification of each asset in our consolidated balance sheet this evaluation requires judgment by us in considering certain criteria that must be evaluated under sfas no 144 such as the estimated time to complete assets that are under development and the timeframe in which we expect to sell our real estate assets the classification of real estate assets determines which real estate assets are to be depreciated as well as what method is used to evaluate and measure impairment had we evaluated our assets differently the balance sheet classification of such assets depreciation expense and impairment losses could have been different 

  

cost capitalization and allocation 

  

when acquiring developing and constructing real estate assets we capitalize costs in accordance with sfas no 67 “ accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate properties ” capitalization begins when we determine that activities related to development have begun and ceases when activities are complete which are timing decisions that require judgment costs capitalized under sfas no 67 include pursuit costs or preacquisitionpreconstruction costs taxes and insurance development and construction costs and costs of incidental operations pursuit costs capitalized in connection with a potential development project that we have determined based on our judgment not to pursue are written off in the period that such determination is made a difference in the timing of when this determination is made could cause the pursuit costs to be expensed in a different period 

  

at times we purchase bulk land that we intend to sell or develop in phases the land basis allocated to each phase is based on the relative estimated fair value of the phases before construction we allocate construction costs incurred relating to more than one phase between the various phases if the costs cannot be specifically identified to a certain phase or the improvements benefit more than one phase we allocate the costs between the phases based on their relative estimated sales values relative allocations of the costs are changed as the sales value estimates are revised 

  

when acquiring real estate with existing buildings we allocate the purchase price between land building and intangibles related to inplace leases if any based on their relative fair values the fair values of acquired land and buildings are determined based on an estimated discounted future cash flow model with leaseup assumptions as if the building was vacant upon acquisition the fair value of inplace leases includes the value of net lease intangibles for above or belowmarket rents and tenant origination costs determined on a lease by lease basis using assumptions for market rates absorption periods lease commissions and tenant improvements the capitalized values for both net lease intangibles and tenant origination costs are amortized over the term of the underlying leases amortization related to net lease intangibles is recorded as either an increase to or a reduction of rental income and amortization for tenant origination costs is recorded to amortization expense if we used different estimates in these valuations the allocation of purchase price to each component could differ which could cause the amount of amortization related to lease intangibles and tenant origination costs to be different as well as depreciation of the related building 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that 

  

some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized loss contingencies resulting from tax audits or certain tax positions are accrued when the potential loss can be reasonably estimated and where occurrence is probable 

  

basis of presentation 

  

recent significant acquisitions 

  

on december 20 2006 pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated october 30 2006 the trammell crow company acquisition agreement by and among us a2 acquisition corp a delaware corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary merger sub and trammell crow company the merger sub was merged with and into trammell crow company the trammell crow company acquisition trammell crow company was the surviving corporation in the trammell crow company acquisition and upon the closing of the trammell crow company acquisition became our indirect wholly owned subsidiary 

  

segment reporting 

  

we report our operations through five segments the segments are as follows 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific 4 global investment management and 5 development services the americas consists of operations located in the united states canada mexico and latin america emea mainly consists of operations in europe while asia pacific includes operations in asia australia and new zealand the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in the united states europe and asia the development services business consists of real estate development and investment activities primarily in the united states which were acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the performance of our various business lines and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our performance under our employee incentive programs 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda is calculated as follows 

  

   

year ended december 31 2006 compared to year ended december 31 2005 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 3186 million for the year ended december 31 2006 on revenue of 40 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 2173 million on revenue of 32 billion for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 8380 million or 262 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 over twothirds of the improvement was due to organic growth while the remainder was attributable to acquisitions completed during 2005 and 2006 the organic revenue growth was primarily driven by continued higher worldwide transaction revenue as well as increased appraisalvaluation mortgage brokerage and property and facilities management fees additionally carried interest revenue earned and higher fees generated in our global investment management business contributed to the increase foreign currency translation had a 281 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2006 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 3570 million or 204 during the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue 

  

performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenue also contributing to the increase was additional headcount which primarily resulted from acquisitions foreign currency translation had a 91 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2006 cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased from 549 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 524 for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily attributable to our mix of revenue with a higher composition of revenue being noncommissionable or earned from markets with lower cost of services 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 13 billion an increase of 2811 million or 275 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide payrollrelated costs including bonuses and carried interest incentive compensation expense as well as increased marketing costs which resulted from our improved operating performance also contributing to the increase were higher costs as a result of acquisitions particularly our acquisition of trammell crow company foreign currency translation had an 89 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2006 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were essentially flat at 323 for the year ended december 31 2006 versus 320 for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 221 million or 485 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily driven by higher amortization expense related to the intangible assets representing net revenue backlog and incentive fees acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition as of december 31 2006 the net book value of the intangible asset representing the remaining net revenue backlog acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition was 258 million which will be fully amortized by the end of 2007 also contributing to the increase over the prior year was higher depreciation expense resulting from increased capital expenditures as well as fixed assets acquired in recent acquisitions 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis decreased by 51 million or 133 for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this was primarily due to higher dispositions within selected funds in our global investment management segment in 2005 partially offset by higher equity income in our emea and americas segments in the current year 

  

our consolidated minority interest expense increased 40 million or 1829 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily due to minority interest associated with our japanese affiliate ikoma which we began fully consolidating in our results in 2006 as a result of our equity interest reaching 51 in the current year 

  

our other income on a consolidated basis was 86 million for the year ended december 31 2006 which represented income related to marking trammell crow company’s investment in savills plc to market for the period december 20 2006 the date of the trammell crow company acquisition through december 31 2006 

  

our consolidated interest income was 98 million for the year ended december 31 2006 a decrease of 14 million or 125 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this decrease was primarily driven by lower average cash balances in 2006 as a result of using cash to pay down debt as well as to fund acquisitions 

  

our consolidated interest expense decreased 113 million or 200 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the overall decline was primarily due to interest savings realized as a result of debt repayments made throughout 2005 and 2006 including the redemption of the remaining outstanding balance of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in june 2006 and the repayment of substantially all of our 9 3  4  senior notes in december 2006 in december 2006 we also entered into an amended and restated credit agreement covering two new senior secured term loan facilities for an aggregate principal amount of up to 22 billion of which we drew down 21 billion to finance our acquisition of trammell crow company we anticipate that annual interest expense for 2007 will be approximately 140 million despite the significant increase in our 

  

leverage as a result of the trammell crow company acquisition our management generally expects to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

our loss on extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 338 million and 74 million for the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these losses were related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the repurchase of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes during the years ended december 31 2006 and 2005 in addition during the year ended december 31 2006 we incurred 116 million of losses related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees as well as premiums paid in connection with the repurchase of our 9 3  4  senior notes and 82 million of losses in connection with the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with our prior credit facility which was replaced during the current year we expect to incur additional charges of this type as we continue our deleveraging efforts in the future 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 1983 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 1389 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in the provision for income taxes is attributable to the significant increase in pretax income over 2005 our effective tax rate declined from 390 for the year ended december 31 2005 to 384 for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of the change in our mix of domestic and foreign earnings 

  

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 2173 million for the year ended december 31 2005 on revenue of 32 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 647 million on revenue of 26 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 5470 million or 207 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the revenue growth was primarily driven by higher worldwide transaction revenue as well as increased appraisal and management fees additionally the continued anticipation of interest rate hikes in the united states during 2005 drove an increase in loan origination volume which resulted in higher loan origination fees investment management fees also increased primarily due to improved performance in the united states foreign currency translation had a 22 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2005 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 2677 million or 180 during the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenue foreign currency translation had a 17 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2005 cost of services as a percentage of revenue decreased from 561 for the year ended december 31 2004 to 549 for the year ended december 31 2005 the decline was primarily due to salaries and related costs associated with our facilities and property management contracts remaining flat yearoveryear while overall revenue the base of the cost of services percentage significantly increased 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 10 billion an increase of 1127 million or 124 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide payrollrelated costs including bonuses as well as increased marketing costs which resulted from our improved operating performance the yearoveryear overall increase in operating expenses was partially muted by the absence of 150 million of onetime compensation expense related to our initial public offering 51 million in writedowns of investments in our americas business segment and 39 million of insigniarelated costs all of which significantly impacted the results for the 

  

year ended december 31 2004 finally foreign currency translation had a 50 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2005 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 343 for the year ended december 31 2004 to 320 for the year ended december 31 2005 reflecting the operating leverage generally inherent in our business structure 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 93 million or 170 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease was largely due to lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the insignia acquisition particularly relative to acquired net revenue backlog as of december 31 2004 the intangible asset representing the net revenue backlog acquired in the insignia acquisition was fully amortized 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 256 million for the year ended december 31 2004 these charges primarily consisted of lease termination costs associated with vacated spaces consulting costs and severance costs all of which were attributable to the insignia acquisition we incurred our final mergerrelated charges associated with the insignia acquisition during the quarter ended september 30 2004 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 174 million or 832 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to improved performance in our global investment management segment resulting from gains realized from the disposition of assets maintained in our investment portfolios as well as higher equity income recognized from the ownership of affiliated companies which have also benefited from improved performance these increases were partially offset by a reduction in earnings in asian investments in our global investment management segment 

  

our consolidated interest income was 112 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 43 million or 620 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily driven by higher average cash balances maintained in 2005 as a result of our improved results as well as rising interest rates 

  

our consolidated interest expense was 563 million for the year ended december 31 2005 a decrease of 118 million or 173 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this decline was primarily driven by interest savings realized as a result of debt repayments during 2004 and 2005 

  

our loss on extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 74 million and 211 million for the years ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the loss incurred for the year ended december 31 2005 related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with repurchases of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market the loss incurred for the year ended december 31 2004 related to writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the redemptions of 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes and 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our 160 senior notes with the net proceeds received from our initial public offering as well as in connection with the 216 million repurchase of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market during may and june 2004 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 1389 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 435 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in the provision for income taxes is mainly attributable to the significant increase in pretax income in 2005 versus 2004 the effective tax rate decreased from 402 for the year ended december 31 2004 to 390 for the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease was primarily a result of the change in mix of our domestic and foreign earnings 

  

segment operations 

  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses and operating income loss by our americas emea asia pacific global investment management and development services operating segments for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

    

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the performance of our various business lines and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our performance under our employee incentive programs 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for net income as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

net interest expense and loss on extinguishment of debt have been expensed in the segment incurred provision for income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable us and foreign effective tax rates ebitda for our segments is calculated as follows dollars in thousands

operating administrative and other expenses increased 518 million or 91 mainly driven by higher payrollrelated costs including bonuses as well as increased marketing costs which primarily resulted from supporting our growing revenues the yearoveryear overall increase in operating administrative and other expenses was partially muted by the absence of 150 million of onetime compensation expense related to our initial public offering 51 million in writedowns of investments and 36 million of insigniarelated costs all of which significantly impacted the results for the year ended december 31 2004 foreign currency translation had a 37 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2005

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 381 million or 501 primarily due to higher carried interest incentive compensation accruals of 339 million recognized for dedicated executives and team leaders with participation interests in certain real estate investments under management for the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded a total of 359 million of incentive compensation expense related to carried interest revenue part of which pertained to the 280 million of revenue recognized in 2005 with the remainder approximately 193 million relating to future periods’ revenue revenue associated with these expenses cannot be recognized until certain contractual hurdles are met foreign currency translation did not have a significant impact on this operating segment during the current year 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under our revolving credit facility included in the capital requirements that we expect to fund during 2007 is approximately 881 million of anticipated net capital expenditures including 273 million associated with recent acquisitions the capital expenditures for 2006 are primarily comprised of information technology costs which are driven largely by computer replacements as well as costs associated with upgrading various servers and systems and leasehold improvements 

  

during 2003 and 2006 we required substantial amounts of new equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of insignia and trammell crow company absent extraordinary transactions such as these we historically have not needed sources of financing other than our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements in the absence of such extraordinary transactions our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next 12 months 

  

as evidenced above from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any further material acquisitions 

  

our current longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of two parts the first is the repayment of the 

  

outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness our management is unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if this cash flow is insufficient then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments if necessary would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the other primary component of our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are our obligations related to our deferred compensation plans and our uk pension plans pursuant to our deferred compensation plans a select group of our management and other highlycompensated employees have been permitted to defer receipt of some or all of their compensation until future distribution dates and have the deferred amount credited towards specified investment alternatives except for deferrals into stock fund units that provide for future issuances of our common stock the deferrals under the deferred compensation plans represent future cash payment obligations for us we currently have invested in insurance and mutual funds for the purpose of funding our future cash deferred compensation obligations in addition upon each distribution under the plans we receive a corresponding tax deduction for such compensation payment our uk subsidiaries maintain pension plans with respect to which a limited number of our uk employees are participants our historical policy has been to fund pension costs as actuarially determined and as required by applicable law and regulations as of december 31 2006 based upon actuarial calculations of future benefit obligations under these plans they were in the aggregate approximately 580 million underfunded 

  

our management expects that any future obligations under our deferred compensation plans and pension plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations 

  

in january 2007 we completed the sale of the approximately 19 ownership in savills plc a real estate services company based in the united kingdom held by trammell crow company the disposition was effected through the sale of approximately 259 million shares of savills plc common stock the proceeds from the sale net of selling costs totaled approximately 3110 million and will be used primarily to reduce debt we expect to record a pretax loss of approximately 340 million in 2007 in connection with the disposition which is largely driven by stock price depreciation from december 31 2006 through the date of sale 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3705 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of 108 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily due to improved operating performance experienced in 2006 in comparison to the year ended december 31 2005 which was evidenced by increases in net income income taxes paid compensation and employee benefits payable and accrued bonuses and profit sharing offset by an increase in accounts receivable this net increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was partially offset by higher deposits in the united kingdom primarily made to replace a letter of credit requirement related to one of our leases as well as an increase in prepaid compensation in the current year lastly the new presentation of incremental tax benefits resulting from stock options exercised as financing inflows in the current year as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 123r versus operating inflows in the prior year also partially offset the overall increase 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3597 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 1724 million compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily due to improved operating performance experienced in 2005 in comparison to the year ended december 31 2004 also contributing to the increase over the prior year was the accelerated timing of payments to vendors in the prior year offset by an additional 200 million of funding of our deferred compensation plan 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 21 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 representing an increase of 19 billion as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was primarily due to the use of cash for acquisitions particularly our acquisition of trammell crow company also contributing to the net increase in the current year was an increase in restricted cash as well as higher capital expenditures the increase in restricted cash represents funds set aside to cover deferred purchase consideration relative to the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1155 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 872 million compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily due to the use of cash for infill acquisitions in 2005 particularly our acquisitions of cb richard ellis gunne in ireland and dalgleish  company in the united kingdom the increase was also driven by the receipt of proceeds in the year ended december 31 2004 from the sale of property held for sale related to a real estate investment in japan partially offset by a decline in capital expenditures 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 15 billion for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of 473 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by the debt financing required by the trammell crow company acquisition net of associated deferred financing fees this increase was partially offset by repayment of debt including the remaining outstanding balance of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes a substantial majority of the remaining outstanding balance of our 9 3  4  senior notes as well as the repayment of our prior senior secured term loan 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 473 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 674 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the repayment of borrowings related to a property held for sale in japan in the prior year partially offset by increased repayments of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the current year 

  

summary of contractual obligations and other commitments 

  

the following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of december 31 2006

indebtedness 

  

our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

most of our longterm indebtedness was incurred in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in july 2001 the insignia acquisition in july 2003 and the trammell crow company acquisition in december 2006 the cb richard ellis services acquisition which was a going private transaction involving members of our senior management affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co and some of our other existing stockholders was undertaken so that we could take advantage of growth opportunities and focus on improvements in the cb richard ellis services businesses the insignia acquisition increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services businesses as well as significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas the trammell crow company acquisition has expanded our global leadership and strengthened our ability to provide integrated account management and comprehensive real estate services for our clients

deferred compensation plan obligations 

  

we have four deferred compensation plans or dcps the first which we refer to as the preaugust 2004 dcp has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals the second which we refer to as the postaugust 2004 dcp became effective on august 1 2004 and began accepting deferrals on august 13 2004 the third which we refer to as the restoration plan was assumed by us in connection with the insignia acquisition has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals the fourth which we refer to as the trammell crow company dcp was adopted by the trammell crow company effective january 1 2006 and was assumed by us in connection with the trammell crow company acquisition 

  

because a substantial majority of the deferrals under our deferred compensation plans have distribution dates based upon the end of a relevant participant’s employment with us we have an ongoing obligation to make distributions to these participants as they leave our employment in addition participants currently may receive unscheduled inservice withdrawals of amounts deferred prior to january 1 2005 subject to a 75 penalty as the level of employee departures or inservice distributions is not predictable the timing of these obligations also 

  

is not predictable accordingly we may face significant unexpected cash funding obligations in the future if a larger number of our employees take inservice distributions or leave our employment sooner than we expect 

  

preaugust 2004 dcp 

  

prior to amending the preaugust 2004 dcp as discussed below each participant in the preaugust 2004 dcp was allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ended or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date the investment alternatives available to participants included two interest index funds and an insurance fund in which gains and losses on deferrals are measured by one or more of approximately 80 mutual funds distributions with respect to the interest index and insurance fund accounts are made by us in cash in addition prior to july 2001 participants were entitled to invest their deferrals in stock fund units that are distributed as shares of our class a common stock as of december 31 2006 there were 3217235 outstanding stock fund units under the preaugust 2004 dcp all of which were vested our stock fund unit deferrals included in additional paidin capital totaled 62 million and 76 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

effective august 1 2004 we closed the preaugust 2004 dcp on august 13 2004 deferrals made by participants for the plan year 2004 were deposited in the postaugust 2004 dcp effective august 1 2004 no additional deferrals were permitted under the preaugust 2004 dcp existing account balances under the plan will be paid to participants in the future according to their existing deferral elections however currently all participants may make unscheduled inservice withdrawals of their account balances including the shares of class a common stock underlying stock fund units if they pay a penalty equal to 75 and the taxes due on the value of the withdrawal unscheduled inservice withdrawals continue to be permitted under this plan because it is grandfathered from the rules of new section 409a of the internal revenue code or irc 

  

postaugust 2004 dcp 

  

effective august 1 2004 we adopted the postaugust 2004 dcp which began accepting deferrals for compensation earned after august 13 2004 at adoption each participant’s original deferral election made for the plan year 2004 in the preaugust 2004 dcp was carried into the postaugust 2004 dcp participants were not allowed to make new deferral elections for the plan year 2004 

  

under the postaugust 2004 dcp each participant is allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ends or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date deferrals are credited at the participant’s election to one or more investment alternatives under the postaugust 2004 dcp which include a moneymarket fund and four mutual fund investment options there is limited flexibility for participants to change distribution elections once made effective january 1 2005 the postaugust 2004 dcp conforms to all the provisions outlined in section 409a of the irc and therefore does not allow for unscheduled inservice distributions 

  

included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets is an accumulated nonstock liability for our preaugust 2004 dcp and postaugust 2004 dcp totaling 2283 million and 1847 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and assets in the form of insurance set aside to cover the liability of 2033 million and 1446 million as of december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively the current portion of the accumulated nonstock liability is 74 million and 161 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively and is included in compensation and employee benefits payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  

restoration plan 

  

the restoration plan assumed in connection with the insignia acquisition has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals the restoration plan is being administered only for the purpose of making distributions when participants terminate employment the restoration plan is unfunded and has an accumulated nonstock liability of 42 million included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2006 and 2005 

  

trammell crow company dcp 

  

effective january 1 2006 trammell crow company established a nonqualified deferred compensation plan or trammell crow company dcp for certain key employees of trammell crow company a portion of the eligible employees’ compensation can be directed into the trammell crow company dcp the trammell crow company dcp is funded and included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is an accumulated nonstock liability of 16 million at december 31 2006 and investments set aside to cover the liability of 16 million at december 31 2006 the investments are included in trading securities and the trammell crow company dcp liability is included in compensation and employee benefits payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december 31 2006 

  

pension liability 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined by an independent pension consulting firm and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover the shortfall the pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 580 million and 412 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 83 million to fund our pension plan for the year ended december 31 2007 

  

other obligations and commitments 

  

we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 50 million as of december 31 2006 excluding letters of credit related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding reserves for claims under certain insurance programs and indebtedness these letters of credit primarily relate to letters of credit executed by trammell crow company in the normal course of business of our development services segment the letters of credit expire at varying dates through june 2010 

  

we had guarantees totaling 68 million as of december 31 2006 excluding guarantees related to indebtedness and operating leases these guarantees primarily include a debt repayment guaranty of an unconsolidated subsidiary as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas the guarantee obligation related to the debt repayment guaranty of an unconsolidated subsidiary expires in december 2009 the other guarantees will expire at the end of each of the respective management agreements 

  

as part of the trammell crow company acquisition we assumed several other trammell crow company debt repayment guarantees of unconsolidated subsidiaries that are subject to the provisions of fin 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others – an interpretation of fasb statements no 5 57 and 107 and rescission of fasb interpretation no 34”  or fin 45 we estimate that our likely exposure under these guarantees is not material on this basis we estimate that the fair value of these guarantees is equivalent to the amount necessary to secure the guarantees using letters of credit from a bank and the aggregate amount is nominal 

  

additionally in connection with the trammell crow company acquisition we have assumed numerous completion and budget guarantees relating to development projects these guarantees were made with thirdparty owners by trammell crow company in the normal course of business each of these guarantees requires us to complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe andor within a specified budget with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget however we generally have “guaranteed maximum price” contracts with reputable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees these contracts are intended to pass the budget risk to such contractors our management does not expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees 

  

as a result of development activities acquired in the trammell crow company acquisition from time to time we act as a general contractor with respect to construction projects we do not consider these activities to be a material part of our business in connection with these activities we seek to subcontract construction work for certain projects to reputable subcontractors should construction defects arise relating to the underlying projects we could potentially be liable to the client for the costs to repair such defects we would generally look to the subcontractor that performed the work to remedy the defect our management does not expect to incur material losses with respect to construction defects 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 2 to 5 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2006 we had committed 673 million to fund future coinvestments of which 414 million is expected to be funded during 2007 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in february 2006 the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued sfas no 155 “ accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments ” or sfas no 155 sfas no 155 amends sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended and sfas no 140 “ accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities ” sfas no 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation it clarifies which interestonly strips and principalonly strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 133 it also establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are free standing derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation the statement will be effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued during fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 155 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in march 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 156 “ accounting for servicing of financial assets ” or sfas no 156 sfas no 156 amends sfas no 140 “ accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities ” with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities the statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract it also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value it provides an entity 

  

with the choice of either amortizing servicing assets and liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss or to measure servicing assets and liabilities at fair value and report changes in fair value in current period earnings the statement will be effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after september 15 2006 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 156 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 fin 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return fin 48 also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition interest penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and classification of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes and transitional requirements upon adoption of fin 48 the provisions of fin 48 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2006 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin 48 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations but are not yet in a position to make this determination the estimated impact of the adoption of fin 48 on our financial statements is subject to change due to the issuance of the fasb staff position on fin 48 and the finalization of our adoption efforts 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “ fair value measurements ” or sfas no 157 which enhances existing guidance for measuring assets and liabilities using fair value sfas no 157 provides a single definition of fair value a framework for measuring fair value and expanded disclosures concerning fair value sfas no 157 also emphasizes that fair value is a marketbased measurement not an entityspecific measurement and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets under sfas no 157 fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 157 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “ employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r ” or sfas no 158 sfas no 158 requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each pension and other postretirement benefit plan as an asset or liability on their balance sheet with all unrecognized amounts to be recorded in other comprehensive income as required we adopted this provision of sfas no 158 and initially applied it to the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans as of december 31 2006 this resulted in a decrease in stockholders’ equity of 86 million which was net of a tax benefit of 37 million the partial adoption of sfas no 158 had no effect on net earnings on cash flows sfas no 158 also ultimately requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of the employer’s fiscal yearend statement of financial position as required we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 158 relative to the measurement date in our fiscal year ending december 31 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact that the full adoption of sfas no 158 will have if any on our consolidated financial position and results of operations

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “ the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities ” or sfas no 159 sfas no 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of sfas no 159 on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 376 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the japanese yen the singapore dollar and the australian dollar we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2006 foreign currency translation had a 281 million positive impact on our total revenue and an 180 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings on april 17 2006 we entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 239 million which expired on various dates through december 29 2006 on april 19 2006 we entered into two option agreements to purchase an aggregate notional amount of 440 million british pounds sterling and 460 million euros both of which expired on december 27 2006 on august 21 2006 we entered into an option agreement to sell a notional amount of 440 million british pounds sterling to offset the option purchased on april 19 2006 and we entered into a foreign currency exchange forward contract with a notional amount of 440 million british pounds sterling which expired on december 29 2006 on december 20 2006 we entered into two option agreements to purchase an aggregate notional amount of 1600 million british pounds sterling which were terminated in january 2007 in connection with the sale of trammell crow company’s investment in savills plc the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on our option agreement as well as our foreign currency exchange forward contracts was not significant for the year ended december 31 2006 we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended when accounting for any such contracts in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2006 consisted of the following dollars in thousands 

  

      

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 68 basis points which would comprise approximately 10 of the weighted average interest rates of our outstanding variable rate debt excluding notes payable on real estate at december 31 2006 the net impact would be a decrease of 150 million on pretax income and cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

we also have 3470 million of notes payable on real estate as of december 31 2006 these notes have interest rates ranging from 60 to 925 with maturity dates extending through 2011 interest costs relating to notes payable on real estate include both interest that is expensed and interest that is capitalized as part of the cost of real estate if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points our total estimated interest cost related to notes payable would increase by approximately 35 million 

  

based on dealers’ quotes at december 31 2006 the estimated fair values of our 9 3  4  senior notes was 35 million estimated fair values for the term loan under our senior secured term loan facilities and our remaining longterm debt are not presented because we believe that they are not materially different from book value primarily because the substantial majority of this debt is based on variable rates that approximate terms that we believe could be obtained at december 31 2006 

  

historically we have not entered into agreements with third parties for the purpose of hedging our exposure to changes in interest rates if we do enter into any such agreements we do so for risk management purposes only and not to engage in speculative activities with respect to interest rates on february 26 2007 we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of 14 billion the purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to hedge potential changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior secured term loan facilities

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in securities exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our board of directors and c prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2006 our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein 

  

our management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting the internal controls of trammell crow company which we acquired on december 20 2006 and is included in our consolidated financial statements for the period from that date through december 31 2006 such exclusion was in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted in management’s report on internal controls over financial reporting in the year of acquisition total assets and total liabilities of trammell crow company represented approximately 189 and 230 respectively of our consolidated assets and liabilities as of december 31 2006 and total financial results for trammell crow company for the 11 days of ownership represented less than 2 of consolidated revenues and operating income for the year then ended 

  

disclosure controls and procedures 

  

we have formally adopted a policy for disclosure controls and procedures that provides guidance on the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate in all material respects and that all information required to be disclosed in the periodic reports submitted by us under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms as of the end of the period covered by this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision 

  

and with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures a disclosure committee consisting of the principal accounting officer general counsel chief communication officer senior officers of each significant business line and other select employees assisted the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer in this evaluation based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as required by the securities exchange act rule 13a15c as of the end of the period covered by this report 

  

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

  

no changes in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of cb richard ellis group inc 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that cb richard ellis group inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission as described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at trammell crow company “tcc” which was acquired on december 20 2006 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 4 percent and 19 percent of net and total assets respectively 1 percent of revenues and 1 percent of net income of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 accordingly our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at tcc the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2006 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended december 31 2006 of the company and our report dated march 1 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules

company overview 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which may be referred to in this form 10k as “we” “us” and “our” is the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2005 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other commercial real estate assets as of december 31 2005 excluding affiliate and partner offices we operated in more than 220 offices worldwide with approximately 14500 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales commercial mortgage originationservicing integrated capital markets equity and debt solutions commercial property and corporate facility management valuation proprietary research and real estate investment management in 2005 we were the only commercial real estate services company included on the fortune 1000 list of the largest publiclyheld companies 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 we generated revenue from a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients that includes more than 70 of the fortune 100 companies many of our clients are consolidating their commercial real estaterelated needs with fewer providers and as a result awarding their business to those providers that have a strong presence in important markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services worldwide as a result of this trend and our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients’ needs across a wide range of markets we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing percentage of our clients’ commercial real estate services needs 

  

cb richard ellis history 

  

cb richard ellis marks its 100 th year of continuous operations in 2006 tracing our origins to a company founded in san francisco in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake that company grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate services firms in the western united states during the 1940s in the 1960s and 70s the company expanded both its service portfolio and geographic coverage to become a fullservice provider with a growing presence throughout the united states 

  

in 1989 employees and thirdparty investors acquired the company’s operations to form cb commercial throughout the 1990s cb commercial moved aggressively to accelerate growth and cultivate global capabilities to meet client demands the company acquired leading firms in investment management westmark realty advisors—now cb richard ellis investors in 1995 mortgage banking lj melody  company—now cbre melody in 1996 and property and corporate facilities management as well as capital markets and investment management koll real estate services in 1997 in 1996 cb commercial became a public company 

  

in 1998 the company then known as cb commercial real estate services group achieved significant global expansion with the acquisition of rei limited rei limited which traces its roots to london in 1773 was the holding company for all “richard ellis” operations outside of the united kingdom following the rei limited acquisition the company changed its name to cb richard ellis services inc and later in 1998 acquired the londonbased firm of hillier parker may  rowden one of the top property services firms operating in the united kingdom with these acquisitions we believe we became the first real estate services firm with a platform to deliver integrated real estate services across the world’s major business capitals through one commonlyowned commonlymanaged company 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which was initially known as blum cb holding corp and later as cbre holding inc was formed by an affiliate of blum capital partners lp as a delaware corporation on february 20 2001 for the purpose of acquiring all of the outstanding stock of cb richard ellis services in a “going private” transaction this transaction which involved members of our senior management team and affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co was completed in 2001 

  

in july 2003 our global position was further solidified as our wholly owned subsidiary cb richard ellis services and insignia financial group inc were brought together to form a premier worldwide fullservice real estate company as a result of the insignia acquisition we now operate globally under the “cb richard ellis” brand name which we believe is a wellrecognized brand in virtually all of the world’s key business centers in order to enhance our financing flexibility and to provide liquidity for some of our stockholders in june 2004 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock lastly in december 2004 we completed a secondary public offering that provided further liquidity for some of our stockholders 

  

our corporate structure 

  

cb richard ellis group inc is a holding company that conducts all of its operations through its indirect subsidiaries cb richard ellis services inc our direct wholly owned subsidiary is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness including our senior secured credit facilities our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 

  

in our americas segment described below substantially all of our advisory services and outsourcing services operations other than mortgage loan origination and servicing are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly owned subsidiaries cb richard ellis real estate services llc which we acquired in connection with the insignia acquisition and was formerly known as insigniaesg inc and cb richard ellis inc our mortgage loan origination and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cbre melody and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are primarily conducted through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cb richard ellis limited 

  

our operations outside the americas segment including our europe middle east and africa asia pacific and global investment management segments described below are conducted through a number of indirect wholly owned subsidiaries the most significant of such subsidiaries in these regions include cb richard ellis ltd the united kingdom cb richard ellis holding sas france cb richard ellis sa spain cb richard ellis bv the netherlands cb richard ellis gunne ireland cb richard ellis pty ltd australia cb richard ellis agency ltd new zealand cb richard ellis ltd hong kong and cb richard ellis pte ltd singapore 

  

operations in our global investment management segment are conducted through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cb richard ellis investors llc and its global affiliates which we also refer to as cbre investors 

  

industry overview 

  

our business covers all aspects of the commercial real estate services industry including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales mortgage origination and servicing real estate capital markets property facilities and project management consulting valuation and appraisal services proprietary research and investment management 

  

we review on a quarterly basis various internallygenerated statistics and estimates regarding both office and industrial space within the us commercial real estate services industry including the total available “stock” of rentable space and the average rent per square foot of space our management believes that changes in the addressable commercial rental market represented by the product of available stock and rent per square foot provide a reliable estimate of changes in the overall commercial real estate services industry because nearly all segments within the industry are affected by changes in these two measurements we estimate that the product of available stock and rent per square foot grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 42 from 1995 through 2005 

  

we believe the key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services companies are primarily 1 the continued outsourcing of commercial real estate services 2 the consolidation of clients’ activities with fewer providers and 3 the increasing institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

outsourcing 

  

motivated by reduced costs lower overhead improved execution across markets increased operational efficiency and a desire to focus on their core competencies property owners and occupiers have increasingly contracted out for their commercial real estate services including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

consolidation 

  

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented there are a limited number of firms that operate on a national or global basis and across the full spectrum of service competencies most firms are substantially smaller than us and operate chiefly on a local or regional basis some of these smaller firms may have a larger local presence than we do in certain competencies we believe that major property owners and corporate users are motivated to consolidate their service provider relationships on a regional national and global basis to obtain more consistent execution across markets to achieve economies of scale and to benefit from streamlined management oversight and the efficiency of single point of contact service delivery as a result we believe large owners and occupiers are awarding a disproportionate share of this business to the larger real estate services providers particularly those that provide a full suite of services across geographical boundaries 

  

institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

institutional owners such as real estate investment trusts or reits pension funds foreign institutions and other financial entities increasingly are acquiring more real estate assets and financing them in the capital markets many institutional investors are allocating a higher percentage of their capital to real estate particularly with borrowing costs low investors believe they can generate higher currentcash yields with real estate investments than with alternative investments gradually improving leasing market fundamentals ie higher 

  

occupancy increased rents also offer these investors the potential for rising future cashflow total us real estate assets held by institutional owners increased to 519 billion in 2005 from 241 billion in 1995 reits were the main drivers of this growth during this period with a portfolio increase of approximately 420 foreign institutions nearly doubled their us real estate holdings over this period while pension funds increased their holdings by 34 we believe it is likely that many of these owners will outsource management of their portfolios and consolidate their use of real estate services vendors 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

we report our results of operations through four segments 1 the americas 2 europe middle east and africa or emea 3 asia pacific and 4 global investment management 

  

information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of our segments is included in “segment operations” within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section and within note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

the americas 

  

the americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the united states and in the largest metropolitan regions in canada mexico and other selected parts of latin america through both wholly owned operations as well as affiliated offices our americas segment accounted for 691 of our 2005 revenue 702 of our 2004 revenue and 709 of our 2003 revenue within our americas segment we organize our services into the following business areas 

  

advisory services 

  

our advisory services businesses offer occupiertenant and investorowner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs including 1 real estate services 2 capital markets and 3 valuation our advisory services business line accounted for 599 of our 2005 revenue 605 of our 2004 revenue and 562 of our 2003 revenue 

  

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of the assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this cost structure gives us flexibility to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for 

  

quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we also invest in greater support resources than most other firms for example we believe our professional development and training programs are the most extensive in the industry in addition we invest heavily in gathering market information technology branding and marketing we also foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to clients through our torto wheaton research unit a leading provider of commercial real estate market information forecasting and consulting services torto wheaton research provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including twr outlook reports for office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering more than 50 us metropolitan areas and the twr select office and industrial database covering over 260000 commercial properties 

  

   

our investment properties business is the largest investment sales property advisor in the us with a market share of 18 in 2005 our us investment sales activity grew by 70 during 2005 versus an increase of 50 for the us market as a whole cbre melody our wholly owned subsidiary originates and services commercial mortgage loans primarily through relationships established with investment banking firms national banks credit companies insurance companies pension funds and government agencies cbre melody’s 178 billion mortgage loan origination volume in 2005 represents an increase of 337 from 2004 approximately 18 billion of loans were originated for federal government sponsored entities most of which were financed through revolving credit lines dedicated exclusively for this purpose loans financed through the revolving credit lines generally occur with principal risk that is substantially mitigated because cbre melody obtains a contractual purchase commitment from the government sponsored entity before it actually originates the loan in 2005 gemsa loan services a joint venture between cbre melody and ge capital real estate serviced approximately 67 billion of mortgage loans 31 billion of which relate to the servicing rights of cbre melody 

  

   

outsourcing services 

  

outsourcing is a longterm trend in commercial real estate with corporations institutions and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of thirdparty real estate specialists our outsourcing services include two business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend 1 asset services and 2 corporate services although our management agreements with our outsourcing clients generally may be terminated on relatively short notice ranging between 30 days to a year we have developed longterm relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships as of december 31 2005 we managed approximately 5221 million square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the americas despite the absolute growth in revenue 

  

generated from our outsourcing services business line from 2003 to 2005 revenue from this line as a percentage of total revenue generated by us has actually declined with revenue from outsourcing representing 92 of our 2005 revenue 97 of our 2004 revenue and 147 of our 2003 revenue

our competitive position 

  

we believe we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the positive trends in the commercial real estate services industry including increased outsourcing consolidation of service providers and higher capital allocations to real estate on the part of institutional owners our strengths include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these strengths will create significant opportunities for our business you should also be aware of the risks that may impact our competitive position which include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

our growth strategy 

  

we believe we have built the premier integrated global services platform in our industry which gives us a distinct competitive advantage in developing this integrated global services platform we acquired such entities as the koll company westmark realty advisors now known as cbre investors lj melody  company now known as cbre melody rei limited and hillier parker may  rowden during the 1990s and in 2003 we acquired insignia today we believe we offer the commercial real estate services industry’s most complete suite of service offerings and that we have a leadership position in many of the top business centers around the world our primary business objective is to leverage this platform in order to garner an increasing share of industry revenues relative to our competitors we believe this will enable us to maximize our longterm cash flow sustain our competitive advantage and increase longterm stockholder value our strategy to achieve these business objectives consists of several elements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and capital markets each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2005 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across geographies property types and services depending on 

  

the geography property type or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield grubb  ellis jones lang lasalle and trammell crow 

  

different factors weigh heavily in the competition for clients in advisory services key differentiating factors include quality service resource depth demonstrated track record analytical skills market knowledge strategic thinking and creative problemsolving these factors are also vital in outsourcing services and are supplemented by consistency of execution across markets economies of scale enhanced efficiency and cost reduction strategies in investment management the ability to enhance asset value and produce solid consistent returns on invested capital are keys to success 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2005 we had approximately 14500 employees worldwide excluding affiliate and partner offices at december 31 2005 188 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements the substantial majority of whom are onsite employees in our asset services business accounts in the new yorknew jersey area we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cb richard ellis” name and the “lj melody” name with respect to the cb richard ellis and lj melody names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cb richard ellis related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cb richard ellis related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them we obtained our most recent us trademark registration for the lj melody name in 1997 and this registration would expire in 2007 if we failed to renew it 

  

in addition to trade names we have developed proprietary technology for preparing and developing valuation reports to our clients through our valuation business and we offer proprietary research to clients through our torto wheaton research unit we also offer proprietary investment structures through cb richard ellis investors while we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the management development use or sale of commercial real estate we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general in addition if we fail to disclose environmental issues in connection with a real estate transaction we may become liable to a buyer or lessee of property environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management business which could adversely impact the result of operations of that business line 

  

applicable laws and contractual obligations to property owners could also subject us to environmental liabilities through our provision of management services environmental laws and regulations impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property as a result we may be held liable as an operator for such costs in our role as an onsite property manager this liability may result even if the original actions were legal and we had no knowledge of or were not responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for the entire amount of the liability if other responsible parties are unable to pay we may also be liable under common law to third parties for property damages and personal injuries resulting from environmental contamination at our sites including the presence of asbestoscontaining materials insurance coverage for such matters may be unavailable or inadequate to cover our liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business

 item 1a risk factors 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business could be harmed in the event of an economic slowdown or recession 

  

periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can reduce volumes for many of our business lines these economic conditions could result in a general decline in rents 

  

which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business if our real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among our various business lines further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services and facilities management lines of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have numerous significant competitors and potential future competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and mortgage brokerage in general with respect to each of our business disciplines we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2005 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do in addition future changes in laws could lead to the entry of other competitors such as financial institutions many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2005 we generated approximately 321 of our revenue from operations outside the 

  

united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans to maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2005 approximately 321 of our business was transacted in currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the singapore dollar and the australian dollar thus we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example during 2004 the us dollar dropped in value against many of the currencies in which we conduct business 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position these hedging activities also may not be effective 

  

our growth has depended significantly upon acquisitions which may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of insignia in july 2003 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions however future acquisitions may not be available at favorable prices or upon advantageous terms and conditions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses for example through december 31 2004 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and 876 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 transactionrelated expenditures included severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 

  

if we acquire companies in the future we may experience integration costs and the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels in connection with the insignia acquisition we have incurred 351 million of expenses through december 31 2005 which are related to the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own 

  

if we are unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we acquire we may not be able to effectively manage them moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and our business could be harmed in the event of a future economic downturn in the california real estate markets 

  

during 2004 and 2005 approximately 209 and 195 respectively of revenue was generated from transactions originating in california as a result of the geographic concentration in california any future economic downturn in the california commercial real estate market and in the local economies in san diego los angeles and orange county could harm our results of operations 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees including those acquired through acquisitions 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including brett white our chief executive officer and president and kenneth j kay our chief financial officer messrs white and kay currently are not parties to employment agreements with us we also are highly dependent upon the retention of our property sales and leasing professionals who generate a significant majority of our revenues as well as other revenue producing professionals if any of our key employees leave or we lose a significant number of key revenue producers and we are unable to quickly hire and integrate qualified replacements our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer in 

  

addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

our results of operations vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year which makes comparisons of our quarterly results difficult 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter this variance among quarters during each calendar year makes comparison between such quarters difficult but does not generally affect the comparison of the same quarters during different calendar years 

  

our leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are leveraged and have debt service obligations for 2005 our interest expense was 543 million our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do 

  

we are able to incur more indebtedness which may intensify the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

our amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures relating to our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 permit us subject to specified conditions to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness including up to 1500 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility our amended and restated credit agreement also permits us to borrow up to 250 million of additional term loans under our term loan facility subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

our debt instruments including the indentures governing our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 and our amended and restated credit agreement impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions will affect and in many respects will limit or prohibit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries’ abilities to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our amended and restated credit agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

the restrictions contained in our debt instruments could 

  

   

   

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the holders of our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 pursuant to the respective indentures may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under the senior secured credit facilities our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 or our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and the completion of our acquisition of insignia the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities received a pledge of all of our equity interests in our significant domestic subsidiaries including cb richard ellis services inc cb richard ellis investors llc cbre melody insignia and cb richard ellis real estate services llc and 65 of the voting stock of our foreign subsidiaries that is held directly by us or our domestic subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our accounts receivable cash general intangibles investment property and future acquired material property as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and liquidate these assets 

  

our coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2005 we had committed 312 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 188 million of these commitments will be funded during 2006 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments these adverse consequences could include damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors providing coinvestment financing is also a very important part of cb richard ellis investor’s investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

participation in real estate transactions through coinvestment activity could increase fluctuations in earnings and cash flow risks associated with these activities include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other partnerships both in the united states and internationally and although we currently have no specific plans to do so we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to real estate brokerage and mortgage transactions and other business lines we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

due to the broad geographic scope of our operations and the numerous forms of real estate services performed we are subject to numerous federal state local and foreign laws and regulations specific to the services performed for example the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions requires us to maintain brokerage licenses in each us state in which we operate if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license we may be required to pay fines or return commissions received or have licenses suspended in addition because the size and scope of real estate sales transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous us state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both in the united states and in foreign countries also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to statutory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales claiming that we did not fulfill our statutory obligations as a broker 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction and engineering services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of a supervisor we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

our stock price is subject to volatility 

  

our stock price is affected by a number of factors including quarterly variations in our results and those of our competitors changes to the competitive landscape estimates and projections by the investment community the arrival or departure of key personnel the introduction of new services by us or our competitors and acquisitions strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors in addition the stock market in general has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations any of these factors may cause declines in the market price of our common stock when the market price of a company’s common stock drops significantly stockholders sometimes institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a securities class action lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources from our business

not applicable 

  




 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices as of december 31 2005 

  

   

as of december 31 2005 our global investment management segment occupied 15 offices including eleven in the americas all in the united states and four in emea since some of our offices contain both employees of our global investment management segment and our other segments offices of our global investment management segment have not been included above as to do so could be duplicative 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the term of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse 

  

movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm based on 2005 revenue with leading fullservice operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world we offer a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other commercial real estate assets as of december 31 2005 excluding affiliates and partner offices we operated in more than 220 offices worldwide with approximately 14500 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including tenant representation propertyagency leasing property sales commercial mortgage originationservicing integrated capital markets equity and debt solutions commercial property and corporate facility management valuation proprietary research and real estate investment management we generate revenues both on a per project or transaction basis and from annual management fees in 2005 we were the only commercial real estate services company included on the fortune 1000 list of the largest publiclyheld companies 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations and make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are most crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for such variances in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies directly affect our operations as well as global and regional commercial real estate markets generally these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the availability of credit to finance transactions and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines weak economic conditions could result in a general decrease in transaction activity and decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business if our real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among our various business lines 

  

beginning in 2003 and continuing through 2005 economic conditions in the united states improved from the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002 which positively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused an improvement in our americas segment’s revenue particularly in sales and leasing activities and we expect this trend to continue in the near term however in the event of a slowdown in the united states economy our revenue growth could be negatively impacted 

  

adverse changes in economic conditions would also affect our compensation expense which is structured to decrease in line with any decrease in revenues compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions is partially mitigated in addition in circumstances when economic conditions are particularly severe our management can look to improve operational performance through reduced senior management bonuses as well as the cutting of capital expenditures and other discretionary operating expenses notwithstanding these approaches adverse global and regional economic changes remain one of the most significant risks to our future financial condition and results of operations 

  

effects of acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world for example we enhanced our mortgage banking services through our 1996 acquisition of lj melody  company now known as cbre melody and we significantly increased the scale of our investment management business through our 1995 acquisition of westmark realty advisors now known as cb richard ellis investors and our 1997 acquisition of koll real estate services our largest acquisition to date was our 2003 acquisition of insignia financial group inc insignia which not only significantly increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services business lines in the americas segment but also significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas 

  

strategic infill acquisitions are an integral component of our growth plans in 2005 we completed seven acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 100 million including our acquisitions of cb richard ellis gunne in ireland and dalgleish  company in the united kingdom in early january 2006 we increased our investment in our japanese affiliate ikoma cb richard ellis kk to 51 and agreed to further increase our ownership interest over time these three international acquisitions are a good example of our efforts to broaden our geographic coverage our acquirees were generally either quality regional firms or niche specialty firms that complement our existing platform or affiliates in which we already held an equity interest 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example through december 31 2004 we incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and 876 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 transactionrelated expenditures included severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 in addition through december 31 2005 we have incurred 351 million of expenses in connection with the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own we expect to incur total integration expenses of approximately 85 million during 2006 which include residual insigniarelated integration costs as well as similar costs related to our strategic infill acquisitions in 2005 and early 2006 

  

international operations 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates our management cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and related costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

we are leveraged and have debt service obligations although our management believes that the incurrence of this longterm indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisition of insignia in 2003 the insignia acquisition the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry 

  

our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness for example we refinanced our senior secured credit facilities in october 2003 and again during 2004 to obtain more attractive interest rates and other terms redeemed 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 16 senior notes in late 2003 and repurchased 216 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market during may and june 2004 

  

in addition on june 15 2004 we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately 1350 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us in connection with the sale of 7726764 shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the completion of our initial public offering during june 2004 we used a portion of the net proceeds received from the offering to prepay 150 million in principal amount of the term loan under our amended and restated credit agreement and during july 2004 we used the remaining net proceeds we received from the offering to redeem all 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our remaining outstanding 16 senior notes and 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes lastly during 2005 we repurchased 427 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market our management expects to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

notwithstanding the actions described above however our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we record real estate commissions on sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded as income once we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant while the remaining portions of the lease commission is earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy the existence of any significant future contingencies such as tenant occupancy results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

investment management and property management fees are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or profit generated by the entities managed and are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements our global investment management segment also earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees these participation interests are generally accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned over the related vesting period 

  

appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered loan origination fees are recognized at the time a loan closes and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction while loan servicing fees are recorded to revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors other commissions consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as income at the time the related services have been performed unless significant future contingencies exist 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectibility our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these individual assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are fully provided for historically our credit losses have been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majorityowned subsidiaries the equity attributable to minority shareholders’ interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control or entities which are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary under the financial accounting standards board or fasb interpretation no 46 revised december 2003 or fin 46r “ consolidation of variable interest entities – an interpretation of arb no 51 ” are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid by us over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of acquired businesses with the majority of the balance resulting from our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 and our acquisition of insignia in 2003 other intangible assets include trademarks which were separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in the 

  

united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to the insignia acquisition both the trademarks and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives the remaining other intangible assets primarily include management contracts loan servicing rights franchise agreements and a trade name which are all being amortized on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

statement of financial accounting standards or sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” requires us to perform at least an annual assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives based on assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information we perform an annual assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment based in part on a thirdparty valuation as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we also assess goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows we completed our required annual impairment tests as of october 1 2005 2004 and 2003 and determined that no impairment existed as of those dates 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized loss contingencies resulting from tax audits or certain tax positions are accrued when the potential loss can be reasonably estimated and where occurrence is probable 

  

basis of presentation 

  

recent significant acquisitions 

  

on july 23 2003 pursuant to an amended and restated agreement and plan of merger dated as of may 28 2003 by and among us cb richard ellis services apple acquisition corp a delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of cb richard ellis services and insignia apple acquisition was merged with and into insignia insignia was the surviving corporation in the merger and at the effective time of the merger became a wholly owned subsidiary of cb richard ellis services also on july 23 2003 immediately prior to the completion of the merger insignia completed the sale of its real estate investment assets to island fund i llc for cash consideration of 369 million pursuant to a purchase agreement dated as of may 28 2003 among us cb richard ellis services apple acquisition insignia and island fund these real estate investment assets consisted of insignia subsidiaries and joint ventures that held 1 minority investments in office retail industrial apartment and hotel properties 2 minority investments in office development projects and a related undeveloped parcel of land 3 wholly owned or consolidated investments in norman oklahoma new york city and the us virgin islands and 4 investments in private equity funds that invest in mortgagebacked debt securities and other real estaterelated assets 

  

segment reporting 

  

we report our operations through four segments the segments are as follows 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific and 4 global investment management the americas consists of operations located in the united states canada mexico and latin america emea mainly consists of operations in europe while asia pacific includes operations in asia australia and new zealand the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in the united states europe and asia 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the performance of our various business lines and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our performance under our employee incentive programs 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income and net income loss each as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda is calculated as follows 

  

   

year ended december 31 2005 compared to year ended december 31 2004 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 2173 million for the year ended december 31 2005 on revenue of 29 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 647 million on revenue of 24 billion for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 5455 million or 231 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the revenue growth was primarily driven by higher worldwide transaction revenue as well as increased appraisal and management fees additionally the continued anticipation of interest rate hikes in the united states during the current year drove an increase in loan origination volume which resulted in higher loan origination fees investment management fees also increased primarily due to improved performance in the united states foreign currency translation had a 22 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2005 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 2663 million or 221 during the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the increase in revenue foreign currency translation had a 17 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2005 cost of services as a percentage of revenue was relatively consistent between periods at 505 for the year ended december 31 2005 versus 509 for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 10226 million an increase of 1127 million or 124 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily driven by higher worldwide payrollrelated costs including bonuses as well as increased marketing costs all of which resulted from our improved operating performance the yearoveryear overall increase in operating expenses was partially muted by the absence of 150 million of onetime compensation expense related to our initial public offering 51 million in writedowns of investments in our americas business segment and 39 million of insigniarelated costs all of which significantly impacted the results for the prior year finally foreign currency translation had a 50 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2005 operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 385 for the year ended december 31 2004 to 351 for the year ended december 31 2005 reflecting the operating leverage inherent in our business structure 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 93 million or 170 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease was largely 

  

due to lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the insignia acquisition particularly relative to acquired net revenue backlog as of december 31 2004 the intangible asset representing the net revenue backlog acquired in the insignia acquisition was fully amortized 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 256 million for the year ended december 31 2004 these charges primarily consisted of lease termination costs associated with vacated spaces consulting costs and severance costs all of which were attributable to the insignia acquisition we incurred our final mergerrelated charges associated with the insignia acquisition during the quarter ended september 30 2004 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 174 million or 832 for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 primarily due to improved performance in our global investment management segment resulting from gains realized from the disposition of assets maintained in our investment portfolios as well as higher equity income recognized from the ownership of affiliated companies which have also benefited from improved performance these increases were partially offset by a reduction in earnings in asian investments in our global investment management segment 

  

our consolidated interest income was 93 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 23 million or 338 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily driven by higher average cash balances maintained in the current year as a result of our improved results as well as rising interest rates 

  

our consolidated interest expense was 543 million for the year ended december 31 2005 a decrease of 138 million or 202 as compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this decline was primarily driven by interest savings realized as a result of debt repayments during 2004 and 2005 our management expects to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

our loss on extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 74 million and 211 million for the year ended december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the loss incurred for the year ended december 31 2005 related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with repurchases of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market the loss incurred in the prior year related to writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the redemptions of 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes and 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our 160 senior notes with the net proceeds received from our initial public offering as well as in connection with the 216 million repurchase of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market during may and june 2004 we expect to incur additional charges of this type as we continue our deleveraging efforts in the future 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 1389 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared to 435 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the increase in the provision for income taxes is mainly attributable to the significant increase in pretax income over 2004 the effective tax rate decreased only slightly to 390 for the year ended december 31 2005 from 402 for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 647 million for the year ended december 31 2004 on revenue of 24 billion as compared to a consolidated net loss of 347 million on revenue of 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 7350 million or 451 during the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily due to the combination of the insignia acquisition and organic market share growth the strong revenue growth in 2004 was driven by significantly higher sales transaction revenue as well as increased lease transaction management 

  

consulting and appraisal fees in our global investment management segment we generated higher investment management fees as a result of incentive fees earned in japan as well as the growth of our business in the united kingdom which was partially attributable to the insignia acquisition additionally with the anticipation of rising interest rates in the united states earlier in 2004 we experienced an increase in loan origination fees in our americas business segment finally foreign currency translation had a 688 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 4073 million or 511 during the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the overall increase in revenue the insignia acquisition contributed to higher payrollrelated costs including bonus accruals insurance and benefits producer retention and broker draw amortization producer retention bonuses were paid to the top real estate advisory services professionals that we retained in the acquisition the producer retention expense represents the amortization of these bonuses which have been amortized through cost of services over the lives of the related employment agreements as part of our refinement of the purchase price allocation for the insignia acquisition during the three months ended march 31 2004 we assigned a 66 million fair value to a broker draw asset acquired in the insignia acquisition based on our management’s estimates we generally derive benefit from brokers participating in our draw program over two years accordingly we estimated that we would derive benefit from the broker draw asset related to insignia’s brokers over two years from the date of the insignia acquisition and accordingly we amortized it on a straightline basis which reflected the pattern in which the economic benefits of the broker draw asset were consumed during the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded 47 million for the amortization of this broker draw asset which included a 14 million adjustment to correct the amortization taken for the period from the date of the insignia acquisition through december 31 2003 the producer retention and the broker draw amortization were considered integration costs associated with the insignia acquisition and together amounted to 104 million for the year ended december 31 2004 foreign currency translation had a 298 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2004 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 488 for the year ended december 31 2003 to 509 for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily driven by producers reaching higher commission tranches as a result of higher revenue as well as the producer retention and broker draw amortization recorded in 2004 and the mix of compensation structures as a result of compensation plans adopted in the insignia acquisition 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 9099 million an increase of 2315 million or 341 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily driven by higher costs as a result of the insignia acquisition as well as increased worldwide payrollrelated expenses such as bonuses and insurance and benefits higher marketing expenses increased net legal costs and higher occupancy expenses particularly in our emea business segment professional fees of 55 million in 2004 related to ongoing sarbanesoxley compliance work and the writedown of investments of 51 million in our americas business segment also contributed to the variance during 2004 we also incurred onetime compensation expense of 150 million related to bonus payments that were triggered by our initial public offering and were payable to several of our nonexecutive real estate advisory services employees as a result of provisions in their employment agreements additionally in 2003 total operating expenses were reduced by substantial net foreign currency transaction gains resulting from a weaker us dollar while in 2004 we experienced only moderate net foreign currency transaction gains the lower net foreign currency transaction gains experienced in the current year were a result of the us dollar weakening at a slower pace as compared to the prior year particularly relative to the australian and new zealand dollars additionally net foreign currency transaction gains were offset in 2004 by 18 million of expense incurred related to option agreements entered into which expired on december 29 2004 finally foreign currency translation had a 304 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 378 million or 408 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was largely due to lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the insignia acquisition including a reduction in amortization expense of 461 million related to acquired net revenue backlog partially offsetting the decrease in amortization expense was a 54 million increase in depreciation expense during 2004 mainly related to depreciation expense associated with fixed assets acquired in the insignia acquisition 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 256 million and 368 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the charges for both years primarily consisted of lease termination costs associated with vacated spaces consulting costs and severance costs all of which were attributable to the insignia acquisition 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 60 million or 405 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 primarily due to the improved overall performance of our equity investments in our americas business segment and our global investment management segment particularly in japan and the united kingdom these increases were partially offset on a yearoveryear comparison basis by the impact of a onetime gain on the sale of owned units in an investment fund recognized in the prior year in the united states in our global investment management segment 

  

our consolidated interest income was 69 million for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 23 million or 498 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 this increase was primarily driven by higher average cash balances maintained in 2004 largely due to the insignia acquisition 

  

our consolidated interest expense was 681 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 42 million or 59 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 primarily due to interest savings realized as a result of debt repayments starting in the fourth quarter of 2003 and continuing throughout 2004 

  

our loss on the extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 211 million and 135 million for the years ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the loss incurred during 2004 was related to the writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the redemptions of 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes and 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our 160 senior notes with the net proceeds received from our initial public offering additionally we incurred a loss of 40 million in the second quarter of 2004 related to the writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid in connection with the 216 million repurchase of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market during may and june 2004 the loss in 2003 related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with a prior credit facility which was replaced in connection with the insignia acquisition and the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid in connection with the redemption of 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 160 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 435 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to a benefit for income taxes of 63 million for the year ended december 31 2003 our effective tax rate rose from a 153 benefit for the year ended december 31 2003 to a 402 provision for the year ended december 31 2004 the increases in the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the current year were primarily driven by the significant increase in pretax income over 2003 the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings also contributed to the yearoveryear variance in the effective tax rate 

  

segment operations 

  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses and operating income loss by our americas emea asia pacific and global investment management operating segments for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally

revenue increased by 5048 million or 437 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the overall increase was primarily driven by the combination of the insignia acquisition and organic market share growth particularly in our real estate services area of our advisory services line of business as a result of the insignia acquisition for the year ended december 31 2004 we generated higher transaction revenues particularly relative to leasing activity primarily in the new york area as well as increased property management fees organic growth was fueled by the continued improvement of general economic conditions which led to an increase in lease transaction revenue organic sales transaction revenue growth was robust due to favorably low interest rates and investors’ increased allocation of funds to real estate while the anticipation of higher interest rates resulted in higher loan origination fees primarily during the first part of 2004 foreign currency translation had a 56 million positive impact on total revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

cost of services increased by 3152 million or 517 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily due to higher commission expense bonus accruals insurance and benefits producer retention and broker draw amortization as a result of the overall increase in revenue as well as due to the insignia acquisition the producer retention expense which represents amounts paid to the top real estate advisory services professionals of insignia that we retained at the time of the acquisition has 

  

been amortized through cost of services over the respective lives of their underlying employment agreements the broker draw amortization of 47 million includes a 14 million adjustment to correct the amortization taken for the period from the date of the insignia acquisition through december 31 2003 it also reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the broker draw asset acquired in the insignia acquisition are consumed the fair value of which was refined during the three months ended march 31 2004 both the producer retention and the broker draw amortization are considered integration costs associated with the insignia acquisition and together amounted to 80 million for the year ended december 31 2004 foreign currency translation had a 29 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2004 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 528 for the year ended december 31 2003 to 557 for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily driven by producers reaching higher commission tranches as a result of higher revenue production as well as the producer retention and broker draw amortization recorded in 2004 and the new mix of compensation structures as a result of compensation plans adopted in the insignia acquisition

revenue increased by 435 million or 405 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily driven by an overall increase in revenue in australia japan and china primarily resulting from our successful efforts to increase market share in the region foreign currency translation had a 122 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2004

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 106 million or 225 primarily due to higher payrollrelated costs including bonuses mainly driven by the increased headcount and improved overall performance in the region a new longterm incentive plan with a four year term was started in australia and new zealand in 2004 as the former longterm incentive plan ended in 2003 despite improved performance compensation expense for australia and new zealand was lower for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 as a result of higher accruals for the former longterm incentive plan in 2003 these accruals are typically higher in the last few years of a longterm incentive plan as measured performance is more heavily weighted in the latter stages of a plan also contributing to the increase in operating expenses were higher marketing expenses particularly in australia and china which was consistent with higher revenue generation foreign currency translation had a 45 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

global investment management 

  

revenue increased by 256 million or 375 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily driven by higher revenues in europe largely due to the growth of our business in the united kingdom which was partially attributable to the insignia acquisition as well as higher incentive fees in japan resulting from the strong market for publicly traded reits foreign currency translation had a 44 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

operating administrative and other expenses increased by 195 million or 345 primarily due to higher payrollrelated costs including bonuses mainly resulting from the revenue growth additionally higher bad debt expense in japan related to the writeoff on an uncollectible receivable during 2004 also contributed to the increase foreign currency translation had a 31 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our amended and restated 

  

credit agreement described below included in the capital requirements that we expect to fund during 2006 is approximately 446 million of anticipated net capital expenditures including 40 million associated with recent infill acquisitions the capital expenditures for 2006 are primarily comprised of information technology costs which are driven largely by computer replacements as well as costs associated with upgrading various servers and systems and leasehold improvements 

  

during 2001 and 2003 we required substantial amounts of new equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of cb richard ellis services and insignia absent extraordinary transactions such as these we historically have not needed sources of financing other than our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements as a result our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next twelve months 

  

from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any material acquisitions 

  

our current longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of two parts the first is the repayment of the outstanding principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness including our senior secured term loan under our amended and restated credit agreement in 2010 our 9 3  4  senior notes in 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in 2011 in may and june 2004 we repurchased 216 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market during june 2004 we used a portion of the net proceeds we received from our june 15 2004 initial public offering to prepay 150 million in principal amount of the senior secured term loan under our amended and restated credit agreement during july 2004 we used the remaining net proceeds received from the offering to redeem all 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our remaining outstanding 16 senior notes and 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes during the year ended december 31 2005 we repurchased 427 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market in the future we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce our debt from time to time our management is unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if this cash flow is insufficient then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments if necessary would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the other primary component of our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are our obligations related to our deferred compensation plans and our uk pension plans pursuant to our deferred compensation plans a select group of our management and other highlycompensated employees have been permitted to defer receipt of some or all of their compensation until future distribution dates and have the deferred amount credited towards specified investment alternatives except for deferrals into stock fund units that provide for future issuances of our common stock the deferrals under the deferred compensation plans represent future cash payment obligations for us we currently have invested in insurance funds for the purpose of funding over half of our future cash deferred compensation obligations in addition upon each distribution under the plans we receive a corresponding tax deduction for such compensation payment our uk subsidiaries maintain pension plans with respect to which a limited number of our uk employees are participants our historical policy has been to fund pension costs as actuarially determined and as required by applicable law and regulations as of december 31 2005 based upon actuarial calculations of future benefit obligations under these plans these plans were in the aggregate approximately 574 million underfunded 

  

our management expects that any future obligations under our deferred compensation plans and pension plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations 

  

historical cash flows 

  

operating activities 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 3597 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 1724 million compared to the year ended december 31 2004 this increase was primarily due to improved operating performance experienced in 2005 in comparison to the year ended december 31 2004 also contributing to the increase over the prior year was the accelerated timing of payments to vendors in the prior year offset by an additional 200 million of funding of our deferred compensation plan 

  

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1872 million for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 997 million compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the acquisition of insignia in july 2003 has impacted substantially all components of cash provided by our operating activities making comparison of 2004 versus 2003 not meaningful 

  

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 1155 million for the year ended december 31 2005 an increase of 872 million compared to the year ended december 31 2004 the increase was primarily due to the use of cash for infill acquisitions in the current year particularly our acquisitions of cb richard ellis gunne in ireland and dalgleish  company in the united kingdom the increase was also driven by the receipt of proceeds in the year ended december 31 2004 from the sale of property held for sale related to a real estate investment in japan partially offset by a decline in capital expenditures 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 284 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 2800 million compared to the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily due to costs incurred in 2003 associated with the insignia acquisition in addition during the year ended december 31 2004 we received proceeds from the sale of property held for sale related to a real estate investment in japan the proceeds from the sale were offset by capital expenditures which increased from the prior year primarily due to integration costs related to leasehold improvements in new and combined offices as a result of the insignia acquisition 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 473 million for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 674 million for the year ended december 31 2004 the decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by the repayment of borrowings related to a property held for sale in japan in the prior year partially offset by increased repayments of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the current year 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 674 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 3037 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily driven by debt repayments made in 2004 as well as a net increase in debt in the prior year mainly relating to the debt financing required by the insignia acquisition the impact of these items was partially offset by debt repayments made in 2003 including 430 million of insignia notes payable and 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 16 senior notes as well as higher deferred financing fees paid in 2003 

  

summary of contractual obligations and other commitments 

  

the following is a summary of our various contractual obligations and other commitments as of december 31 2005 

  

         

initial and secondary public offerings 

  

on june 15 2004 we completed the initial public offering of shares of our class a common stock in connection with the initial public offering we issued and sold 7726764 shares of our class a common stock and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately 1350 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us also in connection with the initial public offering selling stockholders sold an aggregate of 16273236 shares of our class a common stock and received net proceeds of approximately 2906 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions on july 14 2004 selling stockholders sold an additional 229300 shares of our class a common stock to cover overallotments of shares by underwriters and received net proceeds of approximately 41 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions lastly on december 13 2004 we completed a secondary public offering that provided further liquidity for some of our stockholders we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders on june 15 2004 july 14 2004 and december 13 2004 

  

as a public company we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company in addition the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as subsequent rules to the same extent enacted by the securities and exchange commission and the new york stock exchange have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies these rules and regulations including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act and the related rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs 

  

indebtedness 

  

our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

most of our longterm indebtedness was incurred in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in july 2001 and the insignia acquisition in july 2003 the cb richard ellis services acquisition which was a going private transaction involving members of our senior management affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co and some of our other existing stockholders was undertaken so that we could take advantage of growth opportunities and focus on improvements in the cb richard ellis services businesses the insignia acquisition increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services businesses as well as significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas 

  

since 2001 we have maintained a credit agreement with credit suisse or cs and other lenders to fund strategic acquisitions and to provide for our working capital needs on april 23 2004 we entered into an amendment to our previously amended and restated credit agreement that included a waiver generally permitting us to prepay redeem repurchase or otherwise retire up to 300 million of our existing indebtedness and provided for the refinancing of all outstanding amounts under our previous credit agreement as well as the amendment and restatement of our credit agreement upon the completion of our initial public offering on june 15 2004 in connection with the completion of our initial public offering we completed the refinancing of all amounts outstanding under our amended and restated credit agreement and entered into a new amended and restated credit agreement which became effective in connection with such refinancing on november 15 2004 we entered into a first amendment to our new amended and restated credit agreement which reduced the interest rate spread of the term loan and increased flexibility on certain restricted payments and investments on may 10 2005 we entered into a second amendment to our amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement which relaxed the mandatory prepayment clause of the initial credit agreement by permitting us to keep cash otherwise required to be used to pay down principal so long as our leverage ratio is below 25 to 10 

  

our previous credit agreement permitted us among other things to use the net proceeds we received from our ipo to pay down debt including the redemptions in july 2004 of all 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our 16 senior notes due 2011 and 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and the prepayment of 150 million in principal amount of our term loan under our credit agreement which prepayment occurred on june 15 2004

a significant number of our subsidiaries in europe have had a euro cash pool loan since 2001 which is used to fund their shortterm liquidity needs the euro cash pool loan is an overdraft line for our european operations issued by hsbc bank the euro cash pool loan has no stated maturity date and bears interest at varying rates based on a base rate as defined by hsbc bank plus 25 as of december 31 2005 and 2004 there were no amounts outstanding under this facility 

  

deferred compensation plan obligations 

  

we have two deferred compensation plans one of which has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals which we refer to as the old dcp and one of which became effective on august 1 2004 and began accepting deferrals on august 13 2004 which we refer to as the new dcp because a substantial majority of the deferrals under both the old dcp and the new dcp have a distribution date based upon the end of a relevant participant’s employment with us we have an ongoing obligation to make distributions to these participants as they leave our employment in addition participants currently may receive unscheduled inservice withdrawals subject to a 75 penalty as the level of employee departures or inservice distributions is not predictable the timing of these obligations also is not predictable accordingly we may face significant unexpected cash funding obligations in the future if a larger number of our employees take inservice distributions or leave our employment sooner than we expect 

  

old dcp 

  

prior to amending the old dcp as discussed below each participant in the old dcp was allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ended or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date the investment alternatives available to participants included two interest index funds and an insurance fund in which gains and losses on deferrals are measured by one or more of approximately 80 mutual funds distributions with respect to the interest index and insurance fund accounts are made by us in cash in addition prior to july 2001 participants were entitled to invest their deferrals in stock fund units that are distributed as shares of our class a common stock as of december 31 2005 there were 1311724 outstanding stock fund units under the old dcp all of which were vested our stock fund unit deferrals included in additional paidin capital totaled 76 million at december 31 2005 

  

effective january 1 2004 we closed the old dcp to new participants thereafter until january 1 2005 the old dcp accepted compensation deferrals from those participants who had a balance in the plan met the eligibility requirements and elected to participate in each case up to a maximum annual contribution amount of 250000 per participant effective january 1 2005 no additional deferrals are permitted under this plan existing account balances under the plan will be paid to participants in the future according to their existing 

  

deferral elections however currently all participants may make unscheduled inservice withdrawals of their account balances including the shares of class a common stock underlying stock fund units if they pay a penalty equal to 75 and the taxes due on the value of the withdrawal 

  

prior to our initial public offering all shares held by our current and former employees and consultants including any shares that such employees and consultants are entitled to receive as distributions with respect to stock fund units in the old dcp were subject to transfer restrictions in connection with our initial public offering we waived all of these transfer restrictions as a result all of these shares including any shares received as future distributions with respect to stock fund units in the old dcp may be sold subject to applicable securities law requirements shortly after our initial public offering we filed a registration statement on form s8 that registered among other things the shares of class a common stock to be distributed in the future with respect to stock fund units in the old dcp we entered into agreements with participants in the old dcp holding stock fund units with 2280831 underlying shares of class a common stock pursuant to which these participants agreed to sell no more than 20 of the shares underlying their current stock fund unit balances during any month over the five months in the period ending december 31 2004 in exchange for fixed cash payments by us to them 

  

new dcp 

  

effective august 1 2004 we adopted the new dcp which began accepting deferrals for compensation earned after august 13 2004 under the new dcp each participant is allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ends or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date deferrals are credited at the participant’s election to one or more investment alternatives under the new dcp which include a moneymarket fund and a mutual fund investment option there is limited flexibility for participants to change distribution elections once made however all participants may currently make unscheduled inservice withdrawals of their account balances if they pay a penalty equal to 75 and the taxes due on the value of the withdrawal we amended the new dcp effective as of november 18 2005 to conform with us department of treasury and internal revenue service regulations the amendment allowed any participant who elected to defer compensation in 2005 to make a onetime irrevocable election to cancel that deferral election on or before november 30 2005 

  

included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets is an accumulated nonstock liability of 1889 million and 1667 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively and assets in the form of insurance set aside to cover the liability of 1446 million and 1026 million as of december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively the current portion of the accumulated nonstock liability is 161 million and 64 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively and is included in compensation and employee benefits payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 

  

pension liability 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined by an independent pension consulting firm and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover the shortfall the pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 412 million and 279 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 70 million to fund our pension plan for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

other obligations and commitments 

  

we had an outstanding letter of credit totaling 06 million as of december 31 2005 excluding letters of credit related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness and operating leases cbre melody previously 

  

executed an agreement with federal national mortgage association or fannie mae to initially fund the purchase of a commercial mortgage loan portfolio using proceeds from its warehouse line of credit subsequently a 100 participation in the loan portfolio was sold to fannie mae and cbre melody retains the credit risk on the first 2 of losses incurred on the underlying portfolio of commercial mortgage loans the current loan portfolio balance is 627 million and we have collateralized a portion of our obligations to cover the first 1 of losses through a letter of credit in favor of fannie mae for a total of approximately 06 million the other 1 is covered in the form of a guarantee to fannie mae the letter of credit expires on december 10 2006 however we are obligated to renew this letter of credit until our obligation to cover potential credit losses is satisfied 

  

we had guarantees totaling 23 million as of december 31 2005 which includes the obligation to fannie mae discussed above as well as various guarantees of management contracts in our operations overseas the guarantee obligation related to the agreement with fannie mae will expire in december 2007 the other guarantees will expire at the end of each of the respective management agreements 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients these coinvestments typically range from 2 to 5 of the equity in a particular fund as of december 31 2005 we had committed 312 million to fund future coinvestments of which 188 million is expected to be funded during 2006 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which can affect an investor’s ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new tax and accounting pronouncements 

  

on october 22 2004 the president signed the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations in december 2005 we elected to repatriate approximately 560 million under the provisions of the act which resulted in a 35 million charge to income tax expense for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 123—revised “ share based payment ” or sfas no 123r the statement establishes the standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions during 2005 the securities and exchange commission deferred the effective date of this statement until the first annual period beginning after june 15 2005 or in our case january 1 2006 effective january 1 2006 we plan to adopt the modifiedprospective 

  

method for the remaining unvested options that were granted subsequent to our initial public offering in 2004 and plan to adopt the prospective method for the remaining unvested options that were granted prior to our initial public offering in 2004 the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29” or sfas no 153 the guidance in accounting principles board or apb opinion no 29  “accounting for nonmonetary transactions” is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged the guidance in apb opinion no 29 however included certain exceptions to that principle sfas no 153 amends apb opinion no 29 to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange sfas no 153 is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges in fiscal periods beginning after june 15 2005 we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no 153 will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “ accounting changes and error corrections ” or sfas no 154 sfas no 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle it also requires that the new accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement the statement will be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 154 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “ accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments ” or sfas no 155 sfas no 155 amends sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended and sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities” sfas no 155 permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation it clarifies which interestonly strips and principalonly strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no 133 it establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are free standing derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation it also clarifies that concentrations or credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives and it eliminates the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument the statement will be effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued during fiscal years beginning after september 15 2006 we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 155 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2005 approximately 321 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which includes the euro the british pound sterling the canadian dollar the hong kong dollar the singapore dollar and the australian dollar we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels 

  

necessary for operating purposes as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenue and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate during the year ended december 31 2005 foreign currency translation had a 22 million positive impact on our total revenue and a 67 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans expected cash flow and earnings on march 4 2005 we entered into foreign currency exchange forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 60 million which expired on various dates through december 30 2005 on april 19 2005 we entered into an option agreement to purchase an aggregate notional amount of 250 million british pounds sterling which expired on december 28 2005 on april 22 2005 we entered into additional foreign currency exchange forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of approximately 170 million which expired on various dates though december 31 2005 on september 21 2005 we entered into an additional foreign currency exchange forward contract with a notional amount of approximately 40 million which expired on december 30 2005 the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on our option agreement as well as our foreign currency exchange forward contracts was not significant for the year ended december 31 2005 we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended when accounting for any such contracts in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency at december 31 2005 we were not party to any such contracts 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2005 consisted of the following 

  

      

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 57 basis points which would comprise approximately 10 of the weighted average interest rates of our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2005 the net impact would be a decrease of 31 million on pretax income and cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

based on dealers’ quotes at december 31 2005 the estimated fair values of our 9 3  4  senior notes and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes were 1417 million and 1778 million respectively estimated fair values for the term loan under our senior secured credit facilities and our remaining longterm debt are not presented because we believe that they are not materially different from book value primarily because the substantial majority of this debt is based on variable rates that approximate terms that we believe could be obtained at december 31 2005 

  

historically we have not entered into agreements with third parties for the purpose of hedging our exposure to changes in interest rates although we do not have any current intentions to enter into such agreements in the future we may do so in connection with our ongoing assessment of our interest rate exposure if we do enter into any such agreements we would do so for risk management purposes only and not to engage in speculative activities with respect to interest rates we would apply sfas no 133 as amended when accounting for any such derivatives

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2005 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2005 of the company and our report dated march 14 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule

overview 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which may be referred to in this form 10k as “we” “us” and “our” is the largest global commercial real estate services firm based on 2004 revenue offering a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other commercial real estate assets as of december 31 2004 excluding affiliate and partner offices we operated in over 200 offices worldwide with approximately 13500 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including strategic advice and execution assistance for property leasing and sales forecasting valuations origination and servicing of commercial mortgage loans facilities and project management and real estate investment management we generate revenues both on a per project or transaction basis and from annual management fees for the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 892 of our revenue related to engagements on a per project or transaction basis and approximately 108 of our revenue related to ongoing management fee engagements 

  

we have a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients that includes more than 70 of the fortune 100 companies many of our clients are consolidating their commercial real estaterelated expenditures with fewer providers and as a result awarding their business to those providers that have a strong presence in important markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services worldwide as a result of this trend and our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients’ needs across a wide range of markets we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing percentage of our clients’ commercial real estate services expenditures 

  

our history 

  

we trace our roots to a san franciscobased firm formed in 1906 that grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate services firms in the western united states during the 1940s in the 1960s and 70s the company expanded both its service portfolio and geographic coverage to become a fullservice provider with a growing presence throughout the united states 

  

in 1989 employees and thirdparty investors acquired the company’s operations to form cb commercial throughout the 1990s cb commercial moved aggressively to accelerate growth and cultivate global capabilities to meet client demands the company acquired leading firms in investment management westmark realty advisors—now cb richard ellis investors in 1995 mortgage banking lj melody  company in 1996 and property and corporate facilities management as well as capital markets and investment management koll real estate services in 1997 in 1996 cb commercial became a public company 

  

in 1998 the company then known as cb commercial real estate services group achieved significant global expansion with the acquisition of rei limited rei limited which traces its roots to london in 1773 was the holding company for all “richard ellis” operations outside of the united kingdom following the rei limited acquisition the company changed its name to cb richard ellis services inc and later in 1998 acquired the londonbased firm of hillier parker may  rowden one of the top property services firms operating in the united kingdom with these acquisitions we believe we became the first real estate services firm with a platform to deliver integrated real estate services across the world’s major business capitals through one commonlyowned commonlymanaged company 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which was initially known as blum cb holding corp and later as cbre holding inc was formed by an affiliate of blum capital partners lp as a delaware corporation on february 20 2001 for the purpose of acquiring all of the outstanding stock of cb richard ellis services in a “going private” transaction this transaction which involved members of our senior management team and affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co was completed in 2001 

  

in july 2003 our global position was further solidified as cb richard ellis services and insignia financial group inc were brought together to form a premier worldwide fullservice real estate company as a result of 

  

the insignia acquisition we now operate globally under the “cb richard ellis” brand name which we believe is a wellrecognized brand in virtually all of the world’s key business centers in order to enhance our financing flexibility and to provide liquidity for some of our stockholders in june 2004 we completed the initial public offering of our common stock lastly in december 2004 we completed a secondary public offering that provided further liquidity for some of our stockholders 

  

our corporate structure 

  

we are a holding company and conduct all of our operations through our indirect subsidiaries our directlyowned subsidiary cb richard ellis services is also generally a holding company and is the primary obligor or issuer with respect to most of our longterm indebtedness including our senior secured credit facilities our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 

  

in our americas segment described below substantially all of our advisory services and outsourcing services operations other than mortgage loan origination and servicing are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cb richard ellis real estate services inc which we acquired in connection with the insignia acquisition and was formerly known as insigniaesg inc and cb richard ellis inc our mortgage loan origination and servicing operations are conducted exclusively through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary lj melody  company and its subsidiaries our operations in canada are primarily conducted through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cb richard ellis limited 

  

our operations outside the americas segment including our europe middle east and africa asia pacific and global investment management segments described below are conducted through a number of indirect wholly owned subsidiaries the most significant of such subsidiaries in europe middle east and africa include cb richard ellis ltd and cb richard ellis europe ltd the united kingdom cb richard ellis sa and cb richard ellis bourdais holding sas group france cb richard ellis sa spain and cb richard ellis bv the netherlands the most significant of such subsidiaries in asia pacific include cb richard ellis pty ltd australia cb richard ellis agency ltd new zealand cb richard ellis ltd hong kong and cb richard ellis pte ltd singapore 

  

operations in our global investment management segment are conducted through our indirect wholly owned subsidiary cb richard ellis investors llc and its global affiliates 

  

industry overview 

  

our business covers all the various segments that comprise the commercial real estate services industry which includes leasing sales property management facilities management consulting mortgage origination and servicing valuation and appraisal services and investment management 

  

we review on a quarterly basis various internallygenerated statistics and estimates regarding both office and industrial space within the us commercial real estate services industry including the total available “stock” of rentable space and the average rent per square foot of space our management believes that changes in the addressable commercial rental market represented by the product of available stock and rent per square foot provide a reliable estimate of changes in the overall commercial real estate services industry because nearly all segments within the industry are affected by changes in these two measurements we estimate that the product of available stock and rent per square foot grew at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 43 from 1994 through 2004 

  

during the next few years we believe the key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services companies will be 1 the continued outsourcing of commercial real estate services 2 the consolidation of clients’ activities with fewer providers and 3 the increasing institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

outsourcing 

  

motivated by reduced costs lower overhead improved execution across markets increased operational efficiency and a desire to focus on their core competencies property owners and occupiers have increasingly contracted out for their commercial real estate services including the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

consolidation 

  

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented other than the limited number of national and international real estate services firms with whom we compete in a number of service competencies most firms within the industry are local or regional firms that are substantially smaller than us on an overall basis although in some cases have a larger local presence in certain competencies we believe that major property owners and corporate users are motivated to consolidate their service provider relationships on a regional national and global basis to obtain more consistent execution across markets to achieve economies of scale and to benefit from streamlined management oversight and the efficiency of “single point of contact” service delivery as a result we believe large owners and occupiers are awarding a disproportionate share of this business to the larger real estate services providers particularly those that provide a full suite of services across geographical boundaries 

  

institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

institutional owners such as real estate investment trusts or reits pension funds foreign institutions and other financial entities increasingly are acquiring more real estate assets and financing them in the capital markets many institutional investors are dedicating a higher percentage of their capital to real estate particularly with borrowing costs low investors believe they can generate higher currentcash yields with real estate investments than with alternative investments gradually improving leasing market fundamentals ie higher occupancy increased rents also offer these investors the potential for rising future cashflow total us real estate assets held by institutional owners increased to 479 billion in 2004 from 223 billion in 1994 reits were the main drivers of this growth with a portfolio increase of more than 550 over this time period pension fund assets also grew by 53 and foreign institutions augmented their us real estate investments by 71 we believe it is likely that these owners will outsource management of their portfolios and consolidate their use of real estate services vendors 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

effective with the fourth quarter of 2004 we reorganized our business segments for financial reporting purposes by separating the global investment management business from our geographic regions this action was taken in an effort to increase our transparency of reporting in light of the growing significance of our global investment management business this reorganization has reduced revenues and earnings in the americas europe middle east and africa and asia pacific regions but has had no impact on consolidated results all periods presented have been restated to conform with the 2004 presentation 

  

we now report our results of operations through four primary segments 1 the americas 2 europe middle east and africa or emea 3 asia pacific and 4 global investment management within our americas segment we organize our services into the following business areas in order to maximize synergies and crossselling opportunities among our clients a advisory services and b outsourcing services 

  

information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of our segments is included in “segment operations” within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section and within note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is also set forth in note 20 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

the americas 

  

the americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the united states and in the largest metropolitan regions in canada mexico and other selected parts of latin america our americas segment accounted for 702 of our 2004 revenue 709 of our 2003 revenue and 736 of our 2002 revenue 

  

advisory services 

  

corporations institutions and other users of real estate services have been increasingly consolidating their relationships with fewer service providers that have depth of resources a full array of services and broad geographic reach we believe our advisory services businesses have been at the vanguard of this trend offering occupiertenant and investorowner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs including 1 real estate services 2 mortgage loan origination and servicing and 3 valuation our advisory services business line accounted for 613 of our 2004 revenue 575 of our 2003 revenue and 575 of our 2002 revenue 

  

within advisory services our major service lines are the following 

  

   

our real estate services professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of the assignment therefore as compensation is our largest expense this flexible cost structure permits us to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for 

  

quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity we also invest in greater support resources than available at most other firms such as training market information technology and marketing and we foster an entrepreneurial culture that emphasizes client service and rewards performance 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to clients through our torto wheaton research unit a leading provider of commercial real estate market information forecasting and consulting services torto wheaton research provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including twr outlook reports for office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering 54 us metropolitan areas and the twr select office and industrial database coverage of over 210000 commercial properties 

  

   

   

outsourcing services 

  

outsourcing is a longterm trend in commercial real estate with corporations institutions and others seeking to achieve improved efficiency better execution and lower costs by relying on the expertise of thirdparty real estate specialists our outsourcing services business includes two business lines that seek to capitalize on this trend 1 asset services and 2 corporate services although our management agreements with our outsourcing clients generally may be terminated on relatively short notice ranging between 30 days to a year we have developed longterm relationships with many of these clients and we continue to work closely with them to implement their specific goals and objectives and to preserve and expand upon these relationships as of december 31 2004 we managed approximately 4470 million square feet of commercial space for property owners and occupiers which we believe represents one of the largest portfolios in the americas our outsourcing services business line accounted for 89 of our 2004 revenue 134 of our 2003 revenue and 161 of our 2002 revenue 

  

   

   

   

europe middle east and africa emea

our competitive position 

  

we believe we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the positive outsourcing consolidation and increasing institutional ownership trends in the commercial real estate services industry our strengths include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although we believe these strengths will create significant opportunities for our business you should also be aware of the risks that may impact our competitive position which include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

our growth strategy 

  

we believe we have built the premier integrated global services platform in our industry in developing this integrated global platform we acquired such entities as the koll company westmark realty advisors lj melody richard ellis international and hillier parker may  rowden during the 1990s and in 2003 we acquired insignia today we believe we offer the commercial real estate services industry’s most complete suite of service offerings and that we have a leadership position in many of the top business centers around the world our primary business objective is to leverage this platform in order to garner an increasing share of industry revenues relative to our competitors we believe this will enable us to maximize and sustain our longterm cash flow and increase longterm stockholder value our strategy to achieve these business objectives consists of several elements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and mortgage banking each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2004 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield grubb  ellis jones lang lasalle and trammell crow 

  

different factors weigh heavily in the competition for clients in advisory services key differentiating factors include quality service resource depth demonstrated track record analytical skills market knowledge strategic thinking and creative problemsolving these factors are also vital in outsourcing services and are supplemented by consistency of execution across markets economies of scale enhanced efficiency and cost reduction strategies in investment management the ability to enhance asset value and produce solid consistent returns on invested capital are keys to success 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two calendar quarters and higher in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions by yearend 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2004 we had approximately 13500 employees worldwide at december 31 2004 228 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements the substantial majority of whom are employees in our asset services business in the new yorknew jersey area we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 

  

intellectual property 

  

we hold various trademarks and trade names worldwide which include the “cb richard ellis” name although we believe our intellectual property plays a role in maintaining our competitive position in a number of the markets that we serve we do not believe we would be materially adversely affected by expiration or termination of our trademarks or trade names or the loss of any of our other intellectual property rights other than the “cb richard ellis” name and the “lj melody” name with respect to the cb richard ellis and lj melody names we have processed and continuously maintain trademark registrations for these service marks in the united states and the cb richard ellis related marks are in registration or in process in most foreign jurisdictions where we conduct significant business we obtained our most recent us trademark registrations for the cb richard ellis related marks in 2005 and these registrations would expire in 2015 if we failed to renew them we obtained our most recent us trademark registration for the lj melody name in 1997 and this registration would expire in 2007 if we failed to renew it 

  

in addition to trade names we have developed proprietary technology for preparing and developing valuation reports to our clients through our valuation business and we offer proprietary research to clients through our torto wheaton research unit we also offer proprietary investment structures through cb richard ellis investors while we seek to secure our rights under applicable intellectual property protection laws in these and any other proprietary assets that we use in our business we do not believe any of these other items of intellectual property are material to our business 

  

environmental matters 

  

federal state and local laws and regulations impose environmental controls disclosure rules and zoning restrictions that impact the management development use or sale of commercial real estate we are not aware of any material noncompliance with the environmental laws or regulations currently applicable to us and we are not the subject of any material claim for liability with respect to contamination at any location however these laws and regulations may discourage sales and leasing activities and mortgage lending with respect to some properties which may adversely affect both us and the commercial real estate services industry in general in addition if we fail to disclose environmental issues in connection with a real estate transaction we may become liable to a buyer or lessee of property environmental contamination or other environmental liabilities may also negatively affect the value of commercial real estate assets held by entities that are managed by our investment management business which could adversely impact the result of operations of that business line 

  

applicable laws and contractual obligations to property owners could also subject us to environmental liabilities through our provision of management services environmental laws and regulations impose liability on current or previous real property owners or operators for the cost of investigating cleaning up or removing contamination caused by hazardous or toxic substances at the property as a result we may be held liable as an operator for such costs in our role as an onsite property manager this liability may result even if the original actions were legal and we had no knowledge of or were not responsible for the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances under certain environmental laws we could also be held responsible for the entire amount of the liability if other responsible parties are unable to pay we may also be liable under common law to third parties for property damages and personal injuries resulting from environmental contamination at our sites including the presence of asbestoscontaining materials insurance coverage for such matters may be unavailable or inadequate to cover our liabilities additionally liabilities incurred to comply with more stringent future environmental requirements could adversely affect any or all of our lines of business 

  

factors affecting our future performance 

  

set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forwardlooking statements contained in this report and other public statements we make 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business could be harmed in the event of an economic slowdown or recession 

  

periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can reduce volumes for many of our business lines these economic conditions could result in a general decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business if our real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among our various business lines further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

as an example of this risk during 2002 and 2001 we were adversely affected by the slowdown in the us economy which negatively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused a decline in our leasing activities within the united states moreover in part because of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the subsequent conflict with iraq the economic climate in the united states became very uncertain which had an adverse effect on commercial real estate market conditions and in turn our operating results for 2002 and 2001 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services and facilities management lines of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have numerous significant competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and mortgage brokerage in general with respect to each of our business disciplines we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition each of the 

  

business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2004 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than us some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2004 we generated approximately 316 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully implement these plans to maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations is denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2004 approximately 316 of our business was transacted in currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the hong kong dollar the 

  

singapore dollar and the australian dollar thus we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example during 2004 the us dollar dropped in value against many of the currencies in which we conduct business 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position these hedging activities also may not be effective 

  

our growth has depended significantly upon acquisitions which may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of insignia on july 23 2003 any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions however future acquisitions may not be available at advantageous prices or upon favorable terms and conditions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transactionrelated expenses for example through december 31 2004 we have incurred approximately 2009 million of transactionrelated expenses in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 

  

if we acquire companies in the future we may experience integration costs and the acquired businesses may not perform as we expect 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these challenges include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels in connection with the insignia acquisition we recorded significant charges during 2003 and 2004 relating to integration costs 

  

if we are unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we acquire we may not be able to effectively manage them moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and new york and our business could be harmed in the event of a future economic downturn in the california or new york real estate markets 

  

during 2004 and 2003 approximately 209 and 238 respectively of revenue was generated from transactions originating in california and approximately 81 and 69 respectively was generated from transactions originating in the greater new york metropolitan area as a result of the geographic concentrations 

  

in california and new york any future economic downturn in the california or new york commercial real estate markets and in the local economies in san diego los angeles orange county or the greater new york metropolitan area could harm our results of operations 

  

our results of operations vary significantly among quarters during each calendar year which makes comparisons of our quarterly results difficult 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter this variance among quarters during each calendar year makes comparison between such quarters difficult but does not generally affect the comparison of the same quarters during different calendar years 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations for 2004 our interest expense was 654 million our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our substantial debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do 

  

we are able to incur more indebtedness which may intensify the risks associated with our substantial leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

our amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures relating to our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 permit us subject to specified conditions to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness including up to 1500 million of additional indebtedness under our revolving credit facility our amended and restated credit agreement also permits us to borrow up to 250 million of additional term loans under our term loan facility subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our debt instruments impose operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

the indentures governing our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions will affect and in many respects will limit or prohibit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries’ abilities to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

the amended and restated credit agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

the restrictions contained in our debt instruments could 

  

   

   

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior 

  

secured credit facilities and the holders of our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 pursuant to the respective indentures may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which collateral is described in the immediately following risk factor if the debt under the senior secured credit facilities our 9 3  4  senior notes due 2010 or our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes due 2011 were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that this collateral would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and the completion of our acquisition of insignia the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities received a pledge of all of our equity interests in our significant domestic subsidiaries including cb richard ellis services inc cb richard ellis investors llc lj melody  company insignia and insigniaesg inc which was subsequently renamed cb richard ellis real estate services inc and 65 of the voting stock of our foreign subsidiaries that is held directly by us or our domestic subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our accounts receivable cash general intangibles investment property and future acquired material property as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and liquidate these assets 

  

our coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2004 we had committed 243 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 235 million of these commitments will be funded during 2005 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments these adverse consequences could include damage to our reputation with our coinvestment partners and clients as well as the necessity of obtaining alternative funding from other sources that may be on disadvantageous terms for us and the other coinvestors providing coinvestment financing is also a very important part of cbre investor’s investment management business which would suffer if we were unable to make these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in many instances 

  

participation in real estate transactions through coinvestment activity could increase fluctuations in earnings and cash flow risks associated with these activities include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other partnerships both in the united states and internationally and although we currently have no specific plans to do so we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including ray wirta our chief executive officer brett white our president and kenneth j kay our chief financial officer in addition messrs wirta white kay currently are not parties to employment agreements with us on february 22 2005 mr wirta announced his intention to resign as chief executive officer after our annual meeting of stockholders on june 2 2005 at which time mr white will assume the additional title of chief executive officer mr wirta has agreed to serve on the board of directors after that date as vice chairman and will remain our employee during a transition period if any of our key employees leave and we are unable to quickly hire and integrate a qualified replacement our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to real estate brokerage and mortgage transactions and other business lines we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

due to the broad geographic scope of our operations and the numerous forms of real estate services performed we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations specific to the services performed for example the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions requires us to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which we operate if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license we may be required to pay fines or return commissions received or have licenses suspended in addition because the size and scope of real estate sales transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both in the united states and in foreign countries also may change in ways that increase the costs of compliance 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to statutory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties that we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales claiming that we did not fulfill our statutory obligations as a broker 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction and engineering services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of a 

  

supervisor we may be subject to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we agreed to retain contingent liabilities in connection with insignia’s sale of substantially all of its real estate investment assets in 2003 

  

immediately prior to the completion of our acquisition of insignia on july 23 2003 insignia completed the sale of substantially all of its real estate investment assets to island fund under the terms of the purchase agreement we agreed to retain some contingent liabilities related to these real estate investment assets including as of december 31 2004 approximately 52 million of letters of credit support and a guarantee of an approximately 13 million repayment obligation island fund is obligated to reimburse us for only 50 of any future draws against these letters of credit or the repayment guarantee and there can be no assurance that island fund will be able to satisfy any future requests for reimbursement 

  

also in connection with the sale to island fund we agreed to indemnify island fund against any losses resulting from the ownership use or operation of the real estate investment assets prior to the closing of the sale although this indemnification obligation to island fund is subject to a number of exceptions and limitations future claims against us pursuant to this indemnification obligation may be material 

  

in addition a number of the real estate investment assets that we agreed to sell to island fund required the consent of one or more third parties in order to transfer such assets to island fund and some of these third party consents were not obtained prior to the closing and have not been obtained since then as a result we continue to hold these real estate investment assets pending the receipt of these third party consents while we continue to hold these assets we generally have agreed to provide island fund with the economic benefits from these assets and island fund generally has agreed to indemnify us with respect to any losses incurred in connection with our continuing to hold these assets there can be no assurance however that island fund actually will be able to provide such indemnification if required to do so at any future date 

  

our stock price is subject to volatility 

  

our stock price is affected by a number of factors including quarterly variations in our results and those of our competitors the competitive landscape estimates and projections by the investment community the arrival or departure of key personnel the introduction of new services by us or our competitors and acquisitions strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors in addition the stock market in general has historically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations any of these factors may cause declines in the market price of our common stock when the market price of a company’s common stock drops significantly stockholders sometimes institute securities class action lawsuits against the company a securities class action lawsuit against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources from our business

 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices as of december 31 2004 

  

   

as of december 31 2004 our global investment management segment occupied 16 offices including eleven in the americas all in the united states four in emea and one in asia pacific since some of our offices contain both employees of our global investment management segment and our other segments offices of our global investment management segment have not been included above as to do so could be duplicative 

  

in general these leased offices are fully utilized the most significant terms of the leasing arrangements for our offices are the term of the lease and the rent our leases have terms varying in duration the rent payable under our office leases varies significantly from location to location as a result of differences in prevailing commercial real estate rates in different geographic locations our management believes that no single office lease is material to our business results of operations or financial condition in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although adverse movements in rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets when we enter into new leases we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

we are the largest global commercial real estate services firm based on 2004 revenue offering a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other commercial real estate assets as of december 31 2004 excluding affiliates and partner offices we operated in over 200 offices worldwide with approximately 13500 employees providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including strategic advice and execution assistance for property leasing and sales forecasting valuations origination and servicing of commercial mortgage loans facilities and project management and real estate investment management we generate revenues both on a per project or transaction basis and from annual management fees 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations and make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are most crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for such variances in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

economic trends and government policies directly affect our operations as well as global and regional commercial real estate markets generally these include overall economic activity and employment growth interest rate levels the availability of credit to finance transactions and the impact of tax and regulatory policies periods of economic slowdown or recession significantly rising interest rates a declining employment level a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can negatively affect the performance of many of our business lines weak economic conditions could result in a general decrease in transaction activity and decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by our commercial mortgage brokerage business if our real estate and mortgage brokerage businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among our various business lines 

  

during 2002 and 2001 we were adversely affected by the slowdown in the united states economy which negatively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused a decline in our leasing activities within the united states moreover in part because of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the runup to the conflict with iraq the economic climate in the united states became very uncertain which had an adverse effect on commercial real estate market conditions and in turn our operating results for 2002 and 2001 during 2003 and 2004 economic conditions in the united states improved which positively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused an improvement in our americas segment’s revenue particularly in sales and leasing activities we expect this trend to continue in the near term 

  

adverse changes in economic conditions would also affect our compensation expense which is structured to decrease in line with any decrease in revenues compensation is our largest expense and the sales and leasing professionals in our largest line of business advisory services generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis that correlates with our revenue performance as a result the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions is partially mitigated in addition in circumstances when economic conditions are particularly severe our management also has sought to improve operational performance through cost reduction programs for example as economic conditions worsened in 2001 our management team made targeted reductions in our workforce reduced senior management bonuses streamlined general and 

  

administrative operations and cut capital expenditures and other discretionary operating expenses as a result of the operating leverage inherent in our business we were able to reduce our operating expenses by 187 million during 2002 as compared to 2001 notwithstanding these approaches adverse global and regional economic changes remain one of the most significant risks to our future financial condition and results of operations 

  

effects of prior acquisitions 

  

our management historically has made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies to increase our scale within existing competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world for example we enhanced our mortgage banking services through our 1996 acquisition of lj melody  company lj melody and we significantly increased the scale of our investment management business through our 1995 acquisition of westmark realty advisors and our 1997 acquisition of koll real estate services an example of a strategic acquisition that increased our geographic coverage was our 1998 acquisition of hillier parker may  rowden in the united kingdom our largest acquisition to date was our 2003 acquisition of insignia financial group inc insignia which not only significantly increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services business lines in the americas segment but also significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas 

  

although our management believes that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost time and commitment of management resources necessary to attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets our management also believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenditures and charges and the costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example through december 31 2004 we have incurred 2009 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and 876 million of transactionrelated expenditures in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 transactionrelated expenditures include severance costs lease termination costs transaction costs deferred financing costs and mergerrelated costs among others we incurred our final transaction expenditures with respect to the insignia acquisition in the third quarter of 2004 in addition through december 31 2004 we have incurred 280 million of expenses in connection with the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own we expect to incur additional insigniarelated integration expenses of approximately 65 million during 2005 and approximately 40 million during 2006 

  

international operations 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and we may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations through either acquisitions or organic growth fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results our management team generally seeks to mitigate our exposure by balancing assets and liabilities that are denominated in the same currency and by maintaining cash positions outside the united states only at levels necessary for operating purposes in addition from time to time we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate changes related to particular transactions and to hedge risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates our management cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

our international operations also are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations our management routinely monitors these risks and costs and evaluates the appropriate amount of resources to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant 

  

leverage 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations although our management believes that the incurrence of this longterm indebtedness has been important in the development of our business including facilitating our acquisition of insignia financial group in 2003 the cash flow necessary to service this debt is not available for other general corporate purposes which may limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and in the commercial real estate services industry 

  

our management seeks to mitigate this exposure both through the refinancing of debt when available on attractive terms and through selective repayment and retirement of indebtedness for example we refinanced our senior secured credit facilities in october 2003 and again during 2004 to obtain more attractive interest rates and other terms redeemed 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 16 senior notes in late 2003 and repurchased 216 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market during may and june 2004 

  

in addition on june 15 2004 we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately 1350 million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us in connection with the sale of 7726764 shares of our class a common stock pursuant to the completion of our initial public offering during june 2004 we used a portion of the net proceeds received from the offering to prepay 150 million in principal amount of the term loan under our amended and restated credit agreement and during july 2004 we used the remaining net proceeds we received from the offering to redeem all 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our remaining outstanding 16 senior notes and 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes lastly in early 2005 we repurchased 264 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market our management expects to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

notwithstanding the actions described above however our level of indebtedness and the operating and financial restrictions in our debt agreements both place constraints on the operation of our business 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we record real estate commissions on sales generally upon close of escrow or transfer of title except when future contingencies exist real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded as income once we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement terms and conditions of a commission agreement may include but are not limited to execution of a signed lease agreement and future contingencies including tenant occupancy payment of a deposit or payment of a first month’s rent or a combination thereof as some of these conditions are outside of our control and are often not clearly defined judgment must be exercised in determining when such required events have occurred in order to recognize revenue 

  

a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant while the remaining portions of the lease commission is earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy the existence of any significant future contingencies such as tenant occupancy results in the delay of recognition of corresponding revenue until such contingencies are 

  

satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until rent is paid by the tenant 

  

investment management and property management fees are generally based upon percentages of the revenue or profit generated by the entities managed and are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related management agreements our global investment management segment earns performancebased incentive fees with regard to many of its investments such revenue is recognized at the end of the measurement periods when the conditions of the applicable incentive fee arrangements have been satisfied with many of these investments our global investment management team has participation interests in such incentive fees these participation interests are accrued for based upon the probability of such performancebased incentive fees being earned 

  

appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered loan origination fees are recognized at the time a loan closes and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction while loan servicing fees are recorded to revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors other commissions consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as income at the time the related services have been performed unless significant future contingencies exist 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to future collectibility our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these individual assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are fully provided for historically our credit losses have been insignificant however estimating losses requires significant judgment and conditions may change or new information may become known after any periodic evaluation as a result actual credit losses may differ from our estimates 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority owned subsidiaries the equity attributable to minority shareholders’ interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings from these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

goodwill mainly represents the excess of the purchase price paid by us over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 and our acquisition of insignia in 2003 other intangible assets include trademarks which were separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in the united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to the insignia acquisition both the trademarks and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives other intangible assets also included backlog which represented the fair value of insignia’s net revenue backlog as of july 23 2003 that was acquired as part of the insignia acquisition the net revenue backlog consisted of the net commission receivable on insignia’s revenue producing transactions which were at various stages of completion prior to the insignia acquisition net revenue backlog was amortized as cash was received or upon final closing of these pending transactions the remaining other intangible assets primarily include management contracts loan servicing rights franchise agreements and a trade name which are all being amortized on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we adopted sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” effective january 1 2002 this statement requires us to perform at least annually an assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives based on assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information we perform an annual assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment based in part on a thirdparty valuation as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we also assess goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows we completed our required annual impairment tests as of october 1 2004 2003 and 2002 and determined that no impairment existed as of those dates 

  

income taxes 

  

income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted tax rates and laws and are released to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized loss contingencies resulting from tax audits or certain tax positions are accrued when the potential loss can be reasonably estimated and where occurrence is probable

segment reporting 

  

effective with the fourth quarter of 2004 we reorganized our business segments for financial reporting purposes by separating the global investment management business from our geographic regions this action was taken in an effort to increase our transparency of reporting in light of the growing significance of our global investment management business this reorganization has reduced revenues and earnings in the americas europe middle east and africa emea and asia pacific regions but has had no impact on consolidated results all periods presented have been restated to conform with the 2004 presentation 

  

we now report our operations through four primary segments the segments are as follows 1 americas 2 emea 3 asia pacific and 4 global investment management the americas consists of operations located 

  

in the united states canada mexico and latin america emea mainly consists of operations in europe while asia pacific includes operations in asia australia and new zealand the global investment management business consists of investment management operations in the united states europe and asia 

  

results of operations 

  

the following table sets forth items derived from the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

   

ebitda represents earnings before net interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization our management believes ebitda is useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of ebitda generally eliminates the effects of financing and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending and acquisitions which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance as a result our management uses ebitda as a measure to evaluate the performance of our various business lines and for other discretionary purposes including as a significant component when measuring our performance under our employee incentive programs 

  

however ebitda is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap and when analyzing our operating performance readers should use ebitda in addition to and not as an alternative for operating income and net income loss each as determined in accordance with gaap because not all companies use identical calculations our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies furthermore ebitda is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management’s discretionary use as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments the amounts shown for ebitda also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments which are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and noncash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 

  

ebitda is calculated as follows 

  

   

year ended december 31 2004 compared to year ended december 31 2003 

  

we reported consolidated net income of 647 million for the year ended december 31 2004 on revenue of 24 billion as compared to a consolidated net loss of 347 million on revenue of 16 billion for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased by 7350 million or 451 during the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily due to the combination of the insignia acquisition and organic market share growth and we expect that this increased revenue level will be maintained in the near term the strong revenue growth in 2004 was driven by significantly higher sales transaction revenue as well as increased lease transaction management consulting and appraisal fees in our global investment management segment we generated higher investment management fees as a result of incentive fees earned in japan as well as the growth of our business in the united kingdom which was partially attributable to the insignia acquisition additionally with the anticipation of rising interest rates in the united states earlier in the year we experienced an increase in loan origination fees in our americas business segment finally foreign currency translation had a 688 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by 4073 million or 511 during the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 our sales and leasing professionals generally are paid on a commission and bonus basis which substantially correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the overall increase in revenue the insignia acquisition has contributed to higher payrollrelated costs including bonus accruals insurance and benefits producer retention and broker draw amortization producer retention bonuses were paid to the top real estate advisory services professionals that we retained in the acquisition the producer retention expense represents the amortization of these bonuses which are being amortized through cost of services over the lives of the related employment agreements as part of our refinement of the purchase price allocation for the insignia acquisition during the three months ended march 31 2004 we assigned a 66 million fair value to a broker draw asset acquired in the insignia acquisition based on our management’s estimates we generally derive benefit from brokers participating in our draw program over two years accordingly we estimated that we would derive benefit from the broker draw asset related to insignia’s brokers over two years from the date of the insignia acquisition and accordingly we are amortizing it on a straightline basis which reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the broker draw asset are consumed during that period during the year ended december 31 2004 we have recorded 47 million for the amortization of this broker draw asset which includes a 14 million adjustment to correct the amortization taken for the period from the date of the insignia acquisition through december 31 2003 the producer retention and the broker draw amortization are considered integration costs associated with the insignia acquisition and together amounted to 104 million for the year 

  

ended december 31 2004 foreign currency translation had a 298 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2004 cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 488 for the year ended december 31 2003 to 509 for the year ended december 31 2004 primarily driven by producers reaching higher commission tranches as a result of higher revenue as well as the producer retention and broker draw amortization recorded in 2004 and the mix of compensation structures as a result of compensation plans adopted in the insignia acquisition 

  

our operating administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis were 9099 million an increase of 2315 million or 341 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the increase was primarily driven by higher costs as a result of the insignia acquisition as well as increased worldwide payrollrelated expenses such as bonuses and insurance and benefits higher marketing expenses increased net legal costs and higher occupancy expenses particularly in our emea business segment professional fees of 55 million in the current year related to the ongoing sarbanesoxley compliance work as well as the writedown of investments of 51 million in our americas business segment also contributed to the variance during the current year we also incurred onetime compensation expense of 150 million related to bonus payments that were triggered by our initial public offering and were payable to several of our nonexecutive real estate advisory services employees as a result of provisions in their employment agreements additionally in 2003 total operating expenses were reduced by substantial net foreign currency transaction gains resulting from a weaker us dollar while in the current year we experienced only moderate net foreign currency transaction gains the lower net foreign currency transaction gains experienced in the current year were a result of the us dollar weakening at a slower pace as compared to the prior year particularly relative to the australian and new zealand dollars additionally net foreign currency transaction gains were offset in the current year by 18 million of expense incurred related to option agreements entered into which expired on december 29 2004 finally foreign currency translation had a 304 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis decreased by 378 million or 408 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the decrease was largely due to lower amortization expense related to intangibles acquired in the insignia acquisition including a reduction in amortization expense of 461 million related to acquired net revenue backlog as of december 31 2004 the intangible asset representing the net revenue backlog acquired in the insignia acquisition was fully amortized partially offsetting the decrease in amortization expense was a 54 million increase in depreciation expense during 2004 mainly related to depreciation expense associated with fixed assets acquired in the insignia acquisition 

  

our mergerrelated charges on a consolidated basis were 256 million and 368 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the charges for both years primarily consisted of lease termination costs associated with vacated spaces consulting costs and severance costs all of which were attributable to the insignia acquisition 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by 51 million or 356 for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 primarily due to the improved overall performance of our equity investments in our americas business segment and our global investment management segment particularly in japan and the united kingdom these increases were partially offset on a year over year comparison basis by the impact of a onetime gain on the sale of owned units in an investment fund recognized in the prior year in the united states in our global investment management segment 

  

our consolidated interest expense was 654 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 58 million or 82 as compared to the year ended december 31 2003 primarily due to interest savings realized as a result of debt repayments starting in the fourth quarter of 2003 and continuing throughout 2004 as a result of our deleveraging efforts in 2004 we expect to achieve annual cash interest savings of approximately 160 million our management expects to continue to look for opportunities to reduce our debt in the future 

  

our loss on the extinguishment of debt on a consolidated basis was 211 million and 135 million for the year ended december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively the loss incurred during the current year was related to the writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid all in connection with the redemptions of 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9¾ senior notes and 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our 160 senior notes with the net proceeds received from our initial public offering additionally we incurred a loss of 40 million in the second quarter of 2004 related to the writeoffs of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid in connection with the 216 million repurchase of our 11¼ senior subordinated notes in the open market during may and june 2004 the loss in 2003 related to the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees associated with a prior credit facility which was replaced in connection with the insignia acquisition and the writeoff of unamortized deferred financing fees and unamortized discount as well as premiums paid in connection with the redemption of 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 160 senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2003 we expect to incur additional losses in connection with the continuation of our deleveraging efforts in the future 

  

our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was 435 million for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared to a benefit for income taxes of 63 million for the year ended december 31 2003 our effective tax rate rose from a 153 benefit for the year ended december 31 2003 to a 402 provision for the year ended december 31 2004 the increases in the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the current year were primarily driven by the significant increase in pretax income over 2003 the change in the mix of domestic and foreign earnings also contributed to the yearoveryear variance in the effective tax rate 

  

year ended december 31 2003 compared to year ended december 31 2002 

  

we reported a consolidated net loss of 347 million for the year ended december 31 2003 on revenue of 16 billion as compared to consolidated net income of 187 million on revenue of 12 billion for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

our revenue on a consolidated basis increased 4598 million or 393 during the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 the increase was driven by higher revenue as a result of our capturing a larger market share in our americas real estate services business line through our acquisition of insignia particularly relative to leasing activity in the new york area additionally as a result of the improvement of general economic conditions in the united states we experienced significantly higher sales transaction revenue as well as increased lease transaction revenue and appraisal fees internationally the insignia acquisition helped us to expand our reach in europe as evidenced by increased sales and lease transaction revenue as well as higher consultation and appraisal fees particularly in london and paris lastly foreign currency translation had a 544 million positive impact on total revenue during the year ended december 31 2003 

  

our cost of services on a consolidated basis totaled 7964 million an increase of 2493 million or 456 from the year ended december 31 2002 as previously mentioned our sales and leasing professionals are paid on a commission and bonus basis which generally correlates with our revenue performance accordingly the overall increase was primarily driven by the overall increase in revenue the insignia acquisition also contributed to higher payroll related costs including bonus accruals insurance and benefits pension expense and producer retention expense the producer retention expense which represents amounts paid to the top real estate advisory services professionals that we retained at the time of the acquisition is being amortized through cost of services over the lives of the related employment agreements the producer retention expense is considered an integration cost associated with the insignia acquisition and amounted to 27 million for the year ended december 31 2003 finally foreign currency translation had a 239 million negative impact on cost of services during the year ended december 31 2003 costs of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 467 for the year ended december 31 2002 to 488 for the year ended december 31 2003 primarily driven by the new mix of compensation structures as a result of compensation plans adopted in the insignia acquisition

our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by 680 million or 2763 for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 mainly due to 591 million of amortization of the net revenue backlog acquired as part of the insignia acquisition as of december 31 2003 the net book value of the intangible asset representing the remaining net revenue backlog acquired in the insignia acquisition was 134 million which was fully amortized by the end of 2004 see note 7 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the increase over the prior year was also due to a onetime reduction of amortization expense recorded in 2002 related to the adjustment of certain intangible assets to their estimated fair values as of their acquisition date in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 

  

our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased 50 million or 540 for the year ended december 31 2003 as compared to the year ended december 31 2002 primarily due to a onetime gain on sale of owned units in an investment fund in addition the trend of improved performance in our other domestic joint ventures continued but was offset by a decrease in equity income versus the prior year as a result of a onetime disposition fee received in 2002 upon liquidation of one of our us joint ventures in the normal course of business upon completion of the investment strategy set forth in its joint venture agreement

segment operations 

  

the following table summarizes our revenue costs and expenses and operating income loss by our americas emea asia pacific and the global investment management operating segments for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002

liquidity and capital resources 

  

we believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and as necessary borrowings under the revolving credit facility of our amended and restated credit agreement described below included in the capital requirements that we expect to be able to fund during 2005 is approximately 360 million of anticipated capital expenditures the capital expenditures for 2005 are primarily comprised of information technology costs which are driven largely by computer replacement costs as well as costs associated with upgrading various servers and systems and leasehold improvements 

  

during 2001 and 2003 we required substantial amounts of new equity and debt financing to fund our acquisitions of cb richard ellis services and insignia absent extraordinary transactions such as these we historically have not needed sources of financing other than our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital capital expenditure and investment requirements as a result our management anticipates that our cash flow from operations and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future but at a minimum for the next twelve months 

  

from time to time we consider potential strategic acquisitions our management believes that any future significant acquisitions that we make most likely would require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the past we have been able to obtain such financing for other material transactions on terms that our management believed to be reasonable however it is possible that we may not be able to find acquisition financing on favorable terms in the future if we decide to make any material acquisitions 

  

our current longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases generally are comprised of two parts the first is the repayment of the outstanding principal amounts of our longterm indebtedness including our senior secured term loan in 2010 our 9 3  4  senior notes in 2010 and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in 2011 in may and june 2004 we repurchased 216 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market during june 2004 we used a portion of the net proceeds we received from our june 15 2004 initial public offering to prepay 150 million in principal amount of the senior secured term loan under our amended and restated credit agreement during july 2004 we used the remaining net proceeds received from the offering to redeem all 383 million in aggregate principal amount of our remaining outstanding 16 senior notes and 700 million in aggregate principal amount of our 9 3  4  senior notes in early 2005 we repurchased 264 million in aggregate principal amount of our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes in the open market in the future we will continue to look for opportunities to reduce debt our management is unable to project with certainty whether our longterm cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our longterm debt when it comes due if this cash flow is insufficient then our management expects that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend its terms to extend the maturity dates our management cannot make any assurances that such refinancings or amendments if necessary would be available on attractive terms if at all 

  

the other primary component of our longterm liquidity needs other than those related to ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases are our obligations related to our deferred compensation plans and our uk pension plans pursuant to our deferred compensation plans a select group of our management and other highlycompensated employees have been permitted to defer receipt of some or all of their compensation until future distribution dates and have the deferred amount credited towards specified investment alternatives except for deferrals into stock fund units that provide for future issuances of our common stock the deferrals under the deferred compensation plans represent future cash payment obligations for us we currently have invested in insurance funds for the purpose of funding over half of our future cash deferred compensation obligations in addition upon each distribution under the plans we receive a corresponding tax deduction for such compensation payment our uk subsidiaries maintain pension plans with respect to which a limited number of our uk employees are participants our historical policy has been to fund pension costs as actuarially determined and as required by applicable law and regulations as of december 31 2004 based upon actuarial calculations of future benefit obligations under these plans these plans were in the aggregate approximately 419 million underfunded our management expects that any future obligations under our deferred compensation plans and pension plans that are not currently funded will be funded out of our future cash flow from operations

net cash provided by operating activities totaled 1822 million for the year ended december 31 2004 an increase of 1049 million compared to the year ended december 31 2003 the acquisition of insignia in july 2003 has impacted substantially all components of cash provided by our operating activities making comparison against the prior year not meaningful

investing activities 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 233 million for the year ended december 31 2004 a decrease of 2748 million compared to the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily due to costs incurred in 2003 associated with the insignia acquisition in addition during the year ended december 31 2004 

  

we received proceeds from the sale of property held for sale related to a real estate investment in japan the proceeds from the sale were offset by capital expenditures which increased from the prior year primarily due to integration costs related to leasehold improvements in new and combined offices as a result of the insignia acquisition 

  

net cash used in investing activities totaled 2981 million for the year ended december 31 2003 an increase of 2693 million compared to the year ended december 31 2002 this increase was primarily due to costs incurred in 2003 associated with the insignia acquisition capital expenditures of 403 million during the year ended december 31 2003 were 213 million higher than 2002 this increase was mainly driven by capital expenditures incurred in connection with our relocation to new offices in the united kingdom in 2003 

  

financing activities 

  

net cash used in financing activities totaled 674 million for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 3037 million for the year ended december 31 2003 this decrease was primarily driven by debt repayments made in 2004 as well as a net increase in debt in the prior year mainly relating to the debt financing required by the insignia acquisition the impact of these items was partially offset by prior year repayments of 430 million of insignia notes payable and 300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 16 senior notes as well as higher deferred financing fees paid in the prior year 

  

net cash provided by financing activities totaled 3037 million for the year ended december 31 2003 compared to net cash used in financing activities of 178 million for the year ended december 31 2002 this increase was mainly attributable to the additional net debt and equity financing resulting from the insignia acquisition

as a public company we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company in addition the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 as well as subsequent rules to the same extent enacted by the sec and the new york stock exchange have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies these new rules and regulations including section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act and the related rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs 

  

indebtedness 

  

our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

most of our longterm indebtedness was incurred in connection with our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in july 2001 and the insignia acquisition the cb richard ellis services acquisition which was a going private transaction involving members of our senior management affiliates of blum capital partners and freeman spogli  co and some of our other existing stockholders was undertaken so that we could take advantage of growth opportunities and focus on improvements in the cb richard ellis services businesses the insignia acquisition increased the scale of our real estate advisory services and outsourcing services businesses as well as significantly increased our presence in the new york london and paris metropolitan areas

we have two deferred compensation plans one of which has been frozen and is no longer accepting deferrals which we refer to as the old dcp and one of which became effective on august 1 2004 and began accepting deferrals on august 13 2004 which we refer to as the new dcp because a substantial majority of the deferrals under both the old dcp and the new dcp have a distribution date based upon the end of a relevant participant’s employment with us we have an ongoing obligation to make distributions to these participants as they leave our employment in addition participants currently may receive unscheduled inservice withdrawals subject to a 75 penalty as the level of employee departures or inservice distributions is not predictable the timing of these obligations also is not predictable accordingly we may face significant unexpected cash funding obligations in the future if a larger number of our employees take inservice distributions or leave our employment sooner than we expect 

  

old dcp 

  

prior to amending the old dcp as discussed below each participant in the old dcp was allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ends or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date the investment alternatives available to participants include two interest index funds and an insurance fund in which gains and losses on deferrals are measured by one or more of approximately 80 mutual funds distributions with respect to the interest index and insurance fund accounts are made by us in cash in addition prior to july 2001 participants were entitled to invest their deferrals in stock fund units that are distributed as shares of our class a common stock as of december 31 2004 there were 2308803 outstanding stock fund units under the old dcp all of which were vested the deferred compensation liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 1667 million and 1380 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

effective january 1 2004 we closed the old dcp to new participants thereafter until january 1 2005 the old dcp accepted compensation deferrals from those participants who had a balance in the plan met the eligibility requirements and elected to participate in each case up to a maximum annual contribution amount of 250000 per participant effective january 1 2005 no additional deferrals are permitted under this plan existing account balances under the plan will be paid to participants in the future according to their existing deferral elections however currently all participants may make unscheduled inservice withdrawals of their account balances including the shares of class a common stock underlying stock fund units if they pay a penalty equal to 75 and the taxes due on the value of the withdrawal 

  

prior to our initial public offering all shares held by our current and former employees and consultants including any shares that such employees and consultants are entitled to receive as distributions with respect to stock fund units in the old dcp were subject to transfer restrictions in connection with our initial public offering we waived all of these transfer restrictions as a result all of these shares including any shares received as future distributions with respect to stock fund units in the old dcp may be sold subject to applicable securities law requirements shortly after our initial public offering we filed a registration statement on form s8 that registered among other things the shares of class a common stock to be distributed in the future with respect to stock fund units in the old dcp we entered into agreements with participants in the old dcp holding stock fund units with 2280831 underlying shares of class a common stock pursuant to which these participants agreed to sell no more than 20 of the shares underlying their current stock fund unit balances during any month over the five months in the period ending december 31 2004 in exchange for fixed cash payments by us to these participants 

  

new dcp 

  

effective august 1 2004 we adopted the new dcp which began accepting deferrals for compensation earned after august 13 2004 under the new dcp each participant is allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ends or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date deferrals are credited at the participant’s election to one or more investment alternatives under the new dcp which include a moneymarket fund and a mutual fund investment option there is limited flexibility for participants to change distribution elections once made however all participants may currently make unscheduled inservice withdrawals of their account balances if they pay a penalty equal to 75 and the taxes due on the value of the withdrawal 

  

pension liability 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined by an independent pension consulting firm and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover the shortfall the pension liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was 279 million and 360 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively we expect to contribute a total of 58 million to fund our pension plan for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

other obligations and commitments 

  

in connection with the sale of real estate investment assets by insignia to island fund i llc on july 23 2003 insignia agreed to maintain letter of credit support for real estate investment assets that were subject to the purchase agreement until the earlier of 1 the third anniversary of the completion of the sale 2 the date on which the letter of credit is no longer required pursuant to the applicable real estate investment asset agreement or 3 the completion of a sale of the relevant underlying real estate investment asset as of december 31 2004 an aggregate of approximately 52 million of this letter of credit support remained outstanding under the purchase agreement also in connection with the sale insignia agreed to maintain a 13 million guarantee of a repayment obligation with respect to one of the real estate investment assets island agreed to reimburse us for 50 of any draws against these letters of credit or the repayment guarantee while they are outstanding and delivered a letter of credit to us in the amount of approximately 16 million as security for island’s reimbursement obligation as a result of this reimbursement obligation we effectively retain potential liability for 50 of any future draws against these letters of credit and the repayment guarantee however there can be no assurance that island will be able to reimburse us in the event of any draws against the letters of credit or the repayment guarantee or that island’s future reimbursement obligations will not exceed the amount of the letter of credit provided to us by island 

  

lj melody previously executed an agreement with the federal national mortgage association or fannie mae to initially fund the purchase of a commercial mortgage loan portfolio using proceeds from its rfc line of credit subsequently a 100 participation in the loan portfolio was sold to fannie mae and lj melody retains the credit risk on the first 2 of losses incurred on the underlying portfolio of commercial mortgage loans the current loan portfolio balance is 804 million and we have collateralized a portion of our obligations to cover the first 1 of losses through a letter of credit in favor of fannie mae for a total of approximately 09 million the other 1 is covered in the form of a guarantee to fannie mae by lj melody 

  

we had letters of credit totaling 61 million as of december 31 2004 excluding letters of credit related to our subsidiaries’ outstanding indebtedness and operating leases approximately 52 million of these letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement with island described above the remaining 09 million outstanding letter of credit is the fannie mae letter of credit described above the outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2004 expire at varying dates through july 23 2005 however we are obligated to renew the letters of credit related to the island purchase agreement until as late as july 23 2006 and the fannie mae letter of credit until our obligation to cover potential credit losses is satisfied 

  

we had guarantees totaling 91 million as of december 31 2004 which consisted primarily of guarantees of property debt as well as the obligations to island and fannie mae discussed above approximately 44 million of the guarantees are related to investment activity that is scheduled to expire on september 1 2008 the guarantee related to the island purchase agreement expired on the september 15 2004 and was subsequently extended until march 31 2005 currently renewals modifications and extensions of such loan may be made without our consent but the 13 million amount of our guarantee related to such loan may not be increased without our consent in connection with any such renewal modification or extension 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2004 we had committed 243 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 235 million of these commitments will be funded during 2005 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which affects your ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

new accounting and tax pronouncements 

  

on october 22 2004 the president signed the american jobs creation act of 2004 the act the act creates a temporary incentive for us corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and as of today uncertainty remains as to how to interpret 

  

numerous provisions of the act as such we are not in a position to decide on whether and to what extent we might repatriate foreign earnings that have not yet been remitted to the us we are currently conducting an evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provisions of the act and will complete this evaluation by december 31 2005 we do not expect the act to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 123—revised “share based payment” the statement establishes the standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services the statement focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in sharebased payment transactions public companies are required to apply the standard on a modified prospective method under this method a company records compensation expense for all awards it grants after the date it adopts the standard in addition public companies are required to record compensation expense for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first interim or annual period that begins after june 15 2005 the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

during the year ended december 31 2004 approximately 316 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the hong kong dollar the singapore dollar and the australian dollar we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenues and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate for example during 2004 the us dollar dropped against many of the currencies in which we conduct business during the year ended december 31 2004 foreign currency translation had a 688 million positive impact on our total revenue and a 602 million negative impact on our total cost of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate in the normal course of business we also sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans prior to 2004 our management historically had not entered into agreements to hedge the risks associated with the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars on april 6 2004 we entered into an option agreement to purchase an aggregate notional amount of 87 million british pounds sterling for a cost of 06 million which would have expired on december 29 2004 on july 2 2004 we entered into an option agreement to purchase an aggregate notional amount of 188 million euros for a cost of 07 million which also would have expired on december 29 2004 during october 2004 we sold both of these option agreements and entered into two new option agreements to purchase an aggregate notional amount of 102 million british pounds sterling for a cost of 03 million and 200 million euros for a cost of 04 million both of which expired on december 29 2004 the net impact on our earnings resulting from gains andor losses on these option agreements has not been material we apply statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended by sfas no 138 “ accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities ” when accounting for any such 

  

contracts in all cases we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency at december 31 2004 we were not party to any such contracts 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2004 consisted of the following 

  

      

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 41 basis points which would comprise approximately 10 of the weighted average interest rates of our outstanding variable rate debt at december 31 2004 the net impact would be a decrease of 17 million on pretax income and cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

based on dealers’ quotes at december 31 2004 the estimated fair values of our 9 3  4  senior notes and our 11 1  4  senior subordinated notes were 1482 million and 2364 million respectively estimated fair values for the term loan under the senior secured credit facilities and the remaining longterm debt are not presented because we believe that they are not materially different from book value primarily because the majority of this debt is based on variable rates that approximate terms that we believe could be obtained at december 31 2004 

  

historically we have not entered into agreements with third parties for the purpose of hedging our exposure to changes in interest rates although we do not have any current intentions to enter into such agreements in the future we may do so in connection with our ongoing assessment of our interest rate exposure if we do enter into any such agreements we would do so for risk management purposes only and not to engage in speculative activities with respect to interest rates we would apply sfas no 133 as amended by sfas no 138 when accounting for any such derivatives

 item 9a controls and procedures 

  

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

  

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rules 13a15f including maintenance of i records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company and ii policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that a transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america b receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the company’s board of directors and c prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of the inherent limitations of any system of internal control internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses of judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper overriding of controls as a result of such limitations there is risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process therefore it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate this risk 

  

under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in internal controlintegrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations coso of the treadway commission  based on our evaluation under the coso framework our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2004 our management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 has been audited by deloitte  touche llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report which is included herein

report of independent registered public accounting firm 

  

to the board of directors and stockholders of cb richard ellis group inc 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that cb richard ellis group inc and subsidiaries the “company” maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission also in our opinion the company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 

  

we have also audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended december 31 2004 of the company and our report dated march 15 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on these financial statements and the financial statement schedule

overview 

  

cb richard ellis group inc which may be referred to in this form 10k as “we” “us” and “our” is the largest global commercial real estate services firm based on 2003 revenue offering a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other commercial real estate assets as of december 31 2003 we operate in 48 countries with over 13500 employees in 220 offices providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including strategic advice and execution assistance for property leasing and sales forecasting valuations origination and servicing of commercial mortgage loans facilities and project management and real estate investment management we generate revenues both on a per project or transaction basis and from annual management fees 

  

we have a wellbalanced highly diversified base of clients that includes more than 60 of the fortune 100  many of our clients are consolidating their commercial real estaterelated expenditures with fewer providers and as a result awarding their business to those providers that have a strong presence in important markets and the ability to provide a complete range of services worldwide as a result of this trend and our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions for our clients’ needs across a wide range of markets we believe we are well positioned to capture a growing percentage of our clients’ commercial real estate services expenditures

our history 

  

we trace our roots to a san franciscobased firm formed in 1906 that grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate services firms in the western united states during the 1940s in the 1960s and 70s the company expanded both its service portfolio and geographic coverage to become a fullservice provider with a growing presence throughout the united states 

  

in 1989 employees and thirdparty investors acquired the company’s operations to form cb commercial throughout the 1990s cb commercial moved aggressively to accelerate growth and cultivate global capabilities to meet client demands the company acquired leading firms in investment management westmark realty advisors – now cb richard ellis investors in 1995 mortgage banking lj melody  company in 1996 and property and corporate facilities management as well as capital markets and investment management koll real estate services in 1997 

  

in 1998 the company then known as cb commercial real estate services group achieved significant global expansion with the acquisition of rei limited rei limited which traces its roots to london in 1773 was the holding company for all “richard ellis” operations outside of the united kingdom following the rei limited acquisition the company changed its name to cb richard ellis services inc and later in 1998 acquired the londonbased firm of hillier parker may  rowden one of the top property services firms operating in the united kingdom with these acquisitions we believe we became the first real estate services firm with a platform to deliver integrated real estate services across the world’s major business capitals through one commonlyowned commonlymanaged company 

  

in july 2001 cb richard ellis group inc then known as cbre holding inc acquired all of the outstanding stock of cb richard ellis services in a transaction involving our senior management and affiliates of blum capital partners lp and affiliates of freeman spogli  co incorporated in july 2003 our global position was further solidified as cb richard ellis services and insignia financial group inc were brought together to form a premier worldwide fullservice real estate company as a result of the insignia acquisition we now operate globally under the “cb richard ellis” brand name which we believe is a wellrecognized brand in virtually all of the world’s key business centers 

  

industry overview 

  

we estimate the us commercial real estate services market generated approximately 27 billion in revenue in 2003 representing approximately onethird of the total global market for commercial real estate services we also estimate that the us commercial real estate services market grew at a compound annual growth rate of 34 from 1991 through 2003 and we expect this market to grow to approximately 32 billion in revenue by 2006 representing a compound annual growth rate of 58 

  

during the next few years we believe the key drivers of revenue growth for the largest commercial real estate services companies will be 1 the continued outsourcing of commercial real estate services 2 the consolidation of clients’ activities with fewer providers and 3 the increasing institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

outsourcing 

  

motivated by reduced costs lower overhead improved execution across markets increased operational efficiency and a desire to focus on their core competencies property owners and occupiers have increasingly contracted out for their commercial real estate services including transaction management lease administration portfolio management property accounting and facilities management according to an ernst  young study of major corporations published in the fall of 2002 57 of the subject corporations retained thirdparty service providers for transaction management services 46 outsourced their lease administration functions and 37 outsourced their facilities management functions we believe this represents an increase from historical outsourcing of these functions and we expect this outsourcing trend to continue 

  

consolidation 

  

despite recent consolidation the commercial real estate services industry remains highly fragmented other than the limited number of national and international real estate services firms with whom we compete in a number of service competencies most firms within the industry are local or regional firms that are substantially smaller than us on an overall basis although in some cases have a larger local presence in certain competencies we believe that major property owners and corporate users are motivated to consolidate their service provider relationships on a regional national and global basis for a number of reasons including obtaining more consistent execution across markets achieving economies of scale and enhanced purchasing power and benefiting from streamlined management oversight and the efficiency of “single point of contact” service delivery as a result we believe large owners and occupiers are awarding a disproportionate share of this business to the larger real estate services providers particularly those that provide a full suite of services across geographical boundaries 

  

institutional ownership of commercial real estate 

  

institutional owners such as reits pension funds foreign institutions and other financial entities are increasingly acquiring real estate assets and financing them in the capital markets total us real estate assets held by institutional owners increased to 423 billion in 2003 from 223 billion in 1994 reits were the main drivers of this growth with a portfolio increase of more than 400 over this time period pension fund assets also grew by 48 and foreign institutions augmented their us real estate investments by 77 we believe it is likely that institutional owners of commercial real estate assets will consolidate their use of commercial real estate services vendors and outsource management of their portfolios 

  

our regions of operation and principal services 

  

we report through three geographically organized segments 1 americas 2 europe middle east and africa or emea and 3 asia pacific within our americas segment we further organize our full range of services into the following business areas in order to maximize synergies and crossselling opportunities among our clients a advisory services b outsourcing services and c investment management services 

  

information regarding revenue and operating income or loss attributable to each of our segments is included in “segment operations” within the “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” section and within note 21 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which are incorporated herein by reference information concerning the identifiable assets of each of our business segments is set forth in note 21 of our notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated herein by reference 

  

americas 

  

our americas segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the united states and in the largest metropolitan regions in canada mexico and other selected parts of latin america our americas division accounted for 735 of our 2003 revenue 766 of our 2002 revenue and 793 of our 2001 revenue 

  

advisory services 

  

corporations institutions and other users of real estate services have been increasingly consolidating their relationships with fewer service providers that have depth of resources full array of services and broad geographic reach we believe our advisory services businesses have been at the vanguard of this trend offering occupiertenant and investorowner services that meet the full spectrum of marketplace needs including 1 real estate services 2 mortgage loan origination and servicing and 3 valuation our advisory services business line accounted for 597 of our 2003 revenue 605 of our 2002 revenue and 613 of our 2001 revenue 

  

within advisory services our major business lines are the following 

  

   

our advice and execution assistance professionals are compensated primarily through commissionbased programs which are payable upon completion of the assignment therefore as compensation is one of our largest expenses this flexible cost structure permits us to mitigate the negative effect on our operating margins during difficult market conditions due to the low barriers to entry and significant competition for quality employees we strive to retain top professionals through an attractive compensation program tied to productivity 

  

we further strengthen our relationships with our real estate services clients by offering proprietary research to clients through our torto wheaton research unit a leading provider of commercial real estate market information forecasting and consulting services torto wheaton research provides data and analysis to its clients in various formats including twr outlook reports for office industrial hotel retail and multihousing sectors covering 53 us metropolitan areas and twr select office and industrial database access including 245000 commercial properties

our competitive strengths 

  

we believe we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the positive outsourcing consolidation and globalization trends in the commercial real estate services industry our strengths include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our growth strategy 

  

we believe we have built the premier integrated global services platform in our industry in developing this integrated global platform we acquired such entities as the koll company westmark realty advisors lj melody richard ellis international and hillier parker may  rowden during the 1990s and in 2003 we acquired insignia financial group today we believe we offer the commercial real estate services industry’s most complete suite of service offerings and the leadership position in most of the top 25 business centers around the world our primary business objective is to leverage this platform in order to garner an increasing share of industry revenues relative to our competitors we believe this will enable us to maximize and sustain our longterm cash flow and increase longterm stockholder value our strategy to achieve these business objectives consists of several elements 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

competition 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate services industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and mortgage banking each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2003 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other commercial real estate service providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours including cushman  wakefield grubb  ellis jones lang lasalle and trammell crow 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two calendar quarters and higher in the third and fourth calendar quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions by yearend 

  

employees 

  

at december 31 2003 we had approximately 13500 employees worldwide at march 1 2004 approximately 245 of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements the substantial majority of whom are employees in our asset services business in the new yorknew jersey area we believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory 

  

risks related to our business 

  

the success of our business is significantly related to general economic conditions and accordingly our business could be harmed in the event of an economic slowdown or recession 

  

periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can harm many of our business lines these economic conditions could result in a general decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in demand for funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also may reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by the commercial mortgage banking business if the brokerage and mortgage banking businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that the other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among the various business lines further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

as an example of this risk during 2002 and 2001 we were adversely affected by the slowdown in the global economy which negatively impacted the commercial real estate market this caused a decline in our leasing activities within the united states which was only partially offset by improved overall revenues in europe and asia moreover in part because of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the subsequent outbreak of hostilities as well as the conflict with iraq the economic climate in the united states became very uncertain which had an adverse effect on commercial real estate market conditions and in turn our operating results 

  

if the properties that we manage fail to perform then our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

  

the revenue we generate from our asset services and facilities management lines of business is generally a percentage of aggregate rent collections from properties although many management agreements provide for a specified minimum management fee accordingly our success partially depends upon the performance of the properties we manage the 

  

performance of these properties will depend upon the following factors among others many of which are partially or completely outside of our control 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have numerous significant competitors some of which may have greater financial resources than we do 

  

we compete across a variety of business disciplines within the commercial real estate industry including investment management tenant representation corporate services construction and development management property management agency leasing valuation and mortgage banking in general with respect to each of our business disciplines we cannot give assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively or maintain our current fee arrangements or margin levels or that we will not encounter increased competition each of the business disciplines in which we compete is highly competitive on an international national regional and local level although we are the largest commercial real estate services firm in the world in terms of 2003 revenue our relative competitive position varies significantly across product and service categories and geographic areas depending on the product or service we face competition from other real estate service providers institutional lenders insurance companies investment banking firms investment managers and accounting firms some of which may have greater financial resources than we do many of our competitors are local or regional firms although substantially smaller than we are some of these competitors are larger on a local or regional basis we are also subject to competition from other large national and multinational firms that have similar service competencies to ours 

  

our international operations subject us to social political and economic risks of doing business in foreign countries 

  

we conduct a significant portion of our business and employ a substantial number of people outside of the united states during 2003 we generated approximately 302 of our revenue from operations outside the united states circumstances and developments related to international operations that could negatively affect our business financial condition or results of operations include but are not limited to the following factors 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we have committed additional resources to expand our worldwide sales and marketing activities to globalize our service offerings and products in selected markets and to develop local sales and support channels if we are unable to successfully 

  

implement these plans to maintain adequate longterm strategies that successfully manage the risks associated with our global business or to adequately manage operational fluctuations our business financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 

  

in addition our international operations and specifically the ability of our nonus subsidiaries to dividend or otherwise transfer cash among our subsidiaries including transfers of cash to pay interest and principal on our debt may be affected by limitations on imports currency exchange control regulations transfer pricing regulations and potentially adverse tax consequences among other things 

  

our revenue and earnings may be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuations 

  

our revenue from nonus operations has been denominated primarily in the local currency where the associated revenue was earned during 2003 approximately 302 of our business was transacted in currencies of foreign countries the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the hong kong dollar the singapore dollar and the australian dollar thus we may experience fluctuations in revenues and earnings because of corresponding fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates for example during 2003 the us dollar dropped against many of the currencies in which we conduct business 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we will be subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations 

  

from time to time our management uses currency hedging instruments including foreign currency forward and option contracts and borrows in foreign currencies economic risks associated with these hedging instruments include unexpected fluctuations in inflation rates which impact cash flow relative to paying down debt and unexpected changes in the underlying net asset position these hedging activities also may not be effective 

  

our growth has depended significantly upon acquisitions which may not be available in the future 

  

a significant component of our growth has occurred through acquisitions including the acquisition of insignia financial group on july 23 2003 although we currently have no specific acquisition plans any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions however future acquisitions may not be available at advantageous prices or upon favorable terms and conditions in addition acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations and that business judgments concerning the value strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect 

  

if we make future acquisitions we may experience integration problems and the acquired business may not perform as we expect 

  

we have had and may continue to experience difficulties in integrating operations and accounting systems acquired from other companies these difficulties include the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and the potential loss of our key employees or those of the acquired operations we believe that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on operating and net income for example in 2003 we incurred costs associated with integrating insignia financial group’s business into our existing business lines acquisitions also frequently involve significant costs related to integrating information technology accounting and management services and rationalizing personnel levels in connection with the insignia acquisition we recorded significant charges during 2003 relating to integration costs 

  

in addition we have several different accounting systems as a result of acquisitions we have made including the accounting systems of insignia financial group if we are unable to fully integrate the accounting and other systems of the businesses we own we may not be able to effectively manage our acquired businesses moreover the integration process itself may be disruptive to our business as it requires coordination of geographically diverse organizations and implementation of new accounting and information technology systems 

  

a significant portion of our operations are concentrated in california and new york and our business could be harmed if the economic downturn continues in the california or new york real estate markets 

  

during 2003 a significant amount of our revenue was generated from transactions originating in california and the greater new york metropolitan area as a result of the geographic concentrations in california and new york any future economic downturn in the california and new york commercial real estate markets and in the local economies in san diego los angeles orange county or the greater new york metropolitan area could further harm our results of operations 

  

our results of operations vary significantly among quarters which makes comparison of our quarterly results difficult 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could harm our ability to operate our business remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our debt 

  

we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations for 2003 on a pro forma basis our interest expense was 995 million our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness in addition we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions investments joint ventures or for other purposes subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our substantial debt could have other important consequences which include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

we cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations if we do not have sufficient earnings we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt sell assets borrow more money or sell more securities none of which we can guarantee we will be able to do 

  

we will be able to incur more indebtedness which may intensify the risks associated with our substantial leverage including our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

the amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures relating to our 9¾ senior notes due 2010 and our 11¼ senior subordinated notes due 2011 permit us subject to specified conditions to incur a significant amount of additional indebtedness including additional indebtedness under our 900 million revolving credit facility if we incur additional debt the risks associated with our substantial leverage including our ability to service our debt would increase 

  

our debt instruments impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and in the event of a default all of our borrowings would become immediately due and payable 

  

the indentures governing our 9¾ senior notes due 2010 and our 11¼ senior subordinated notes due 2011 impose and the terms of any future debt may impose operating and other restrictions on us and many of our subsidiaries these restrictions will affect and in many respects will limit or prohibit our ability and our restricted subsidiaries’ abilities to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

in addition the amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities includes other and more restrictive covenants and prohibits us from prepaying most of our other debt while debt under our senior secured credit facilities is outstanding the amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities also requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control 

  

the restrictions contained in our debt instruments could 

  

   

   

a breach of any of these restrictive covenants or the inability to comply with the required financial ratios could result in a default under our debt instruments if any such default occurs the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities and the holders of our 9¾ senior notes due 2010 and our 11¼ senior subordinated notes due 2011 pursuant to the respective indentures may elect to declare all outstanding borrowings together with accrued interest and other fees to be immediately due and payable the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings if we are unable to repay outstanding borrowings when due the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will have the right to proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure the debt which includes our available cash if the debt under the senior secured credit facilities our 9¾ senior notes due 2010 and our 11¼ senior subordinated notes due 2011 were to be accelerated we cannot give assurance that our assets would be sufficient to repay our debt 

  

if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could foreclose on and acquire control of substantially all of our assets 

  

in connection with the incurrence of indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and the completion of our acquisition of insignia financial group inc the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities received a pledge of all of our equity interests in our significant domestic subsidiaries including cb richard ellis services inc cb richard ellis investors llc lj melody  company insignia financial group and insigniaesg inc which was subsequently renamed cb richard ellis real estate services inc and 65 of the voting stock of our foreign subsidiaries that is held directly by us or our domestic subsidiaries additionally these lenders generally have a lien on substantially all of our accounts receivable cash general intangibles investment property and future acquired material property as a result of these pledges and liens if we fail to meet our payment or other obligations under the senior secured credit facilities the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities will be entitled to foreclose on substantially all of our assets and liquidate these assets 

  

our coinvestment activities subject us to real estate investment risks which could cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flow 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2003 we had committed 266 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 23 million of these commitments will be funded during 2004 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the coinvestment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse 

  

consequences to our interests in these investments although our debt instruments contain restrictions that will limit our ability to provide capital to the entities holding direct or indirect interests in coinvestments we may provide this capital in some instances 

  

participation in real estate transactions through coinvestment activity could increase fluctuations in earnings and cash flow other risks associated with these activities include but are not limited to the following 

  

   

   

   

our joint venture activities involve unique risks that are often outside of our control which if realized could harm our business 

  

we have utilized joint ventures for commercial investments and local brokerage and other partnerships both in the united states and internationally and we may acquire minority interests in other joint ventures in the future in many of these joint ventures we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures and other participants may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives in addition the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interest it could harm our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our success depends upon the retention of our senior management as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified and experienced employees 

  

our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees including ray wirta our chief executive officer brett white our president kenneth j kay our chief financial officer stephen siegel our chairman global brokerage mitchell rudin our president us brokerage services and alan froggatt our chief executive officer emea in addition messrs wirta and white currently are not parties to employment agreements with us if any of our key employees leave and we are unable to quickly hire and integrate a qualified replacement our business financial condition and results of operations may suffer in addition the growth of our business is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in all areas of our business including brokerage and property management personnel if we are unable to attract and retain these qualified personnel our growth may be limited and our business and operating results could suffer 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to real estate brokerage and mortgage transactions and other business lines we may incur significant financial penalties 

  

due to the broad geographic scope of our operations and the numerous forms of real estate services performed we are subject to numerous federal state and local laws and regulations specific to the services performed for example the brokerage of real estate sales and leasing transactions requires us to maintain brokerage licenses in each state in which we operate if we fail to maintain our licenses or conduct brokerage activities without a license we may be required to pay fines or return commissions received or have licenses suspended in addition because the size and scope of real estate sales transactions have increased significantly during the past several years both the difficulty of ensuring compliance with the numerous state licensing regimes and the possible loss resulting from noncompliance have increased furthermore the laws and regulations applicable to our business both in the united states and in foreign countries also may change in ways that materially increase the costs of compliance 

  

we may have liabilities in connection with real estate brokerage and property management activities 

  

as a licensed real estate broker we and our licensed employees are subject to statutory due diligence disclosure and standardofcare obligations failure to fulfill these obligations could subject us or our employees to litigation from parties who purchased sold or leased properties we or they brokered or managed we could become subject to claims by participants in real estate sales claiming that we did not fulfill our statutory obligations as a broker 

  

in addition in our property management business we hire and supervise thirdparty contractors to provide construction and engineering services for our managed properties while our role is limited to that of a supervisor we may be subjected to claims for construction defects or other similar actions adverse outcomes of property management litigation could negatively impact our business financial condition or results of operations 

  

we agreed to retain contingent liabilities in connection with insignia’s sale of substantially all of its real estate investment assets in 2003 

  

immediately prior to the completion of our acquisition of insignia financial group on july 23 2003 insignia completed the sale of substantially all of its real estate investment assets to island fund under the terms of the purchase agreement we agreed to retain some contingent liabilities related to these real estate investment assets including approximately 102 million of letters of credit support and a guarantee of approximately a 13 million repayment obligation island fund is obligated to reimburse us for only 50 of any future draws against these letters of credit or the repayment guarantee and there can be no assurance that island fund will be able to satisfy any future requests for reimbursement 

  

also in connection with the sale to island fund we agreed to indemnify island fund against any losses resulting from the ownership use or operation of the real estate investment assets prior to the closing of the sale although this indemnification obligation to island fund is subject to a number of exceptions and limitations future claims against us pursuant to this indemnification obligation may be material 

  

in addition a number of the real estate investment assets that we agreed to sell to island fund required the consent of one or more third parties in order to transfer such assets to island fund and some of these third party consents were not obtained prior to or since the closing as a result we continue to hold these real estate investment assets pending the receipt of these third party consents while we continue to hold these assets we generally have agreed to provide island fund with the economic benefits from these assets and island fund generally has agreed to indemnify us with respect to any losses incurred in connection with our continuing to hold these assets there can be no assurance however that island fund actually will be able to provide such indemnification if required to do so at any future date 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

we occupied the following offices as of december 31 2003 

  

   

we do not own any offices which is consistent with our strategy to lease instead of own in general these leased offices are fully utilized in addition we believe there is adequate alternative office space available at acceptable rental rates to meet our needs although rental rates in some markets may negatively affect our profits in those markets 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are party to a number of pending or threatened lawsuits arising out of or incident to our ordinary course of business our management believes that any liability imposed on us that may result from disposition of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

  

there were no matters submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of 2003 

  

part ii 

  




 item 5 market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 

  

neither our class a common stock nor our class b common stock is publicly traded on any exchange or in any market at march 1 2004 we had 84 record holders of our class a common stock and 12 record holders of our class b common stock 

  

we have not declared or paid any dividends on any class of our common stock since our inception on february 20 2001 and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance future growth any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition results of operations capital requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant in addition our ability to declare and pay dividends is restricted by the amended and restated credit agreement governing our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures relating to our 16 senior notes due 2011 our 9 ¾ senior notes due 2010 and our 11¼ senior subordinated notes due 2011 

  

during 2003 in recruiting various key employees we offered such employees the right to purchase shares of our class a common stock in each case at 1600 per share in the following transactions 

  

   

such stock was issued pursuant to our 2001 stock incentive plan in transactions exempt from registration under rule 701 promulgated pursuant to the securities act of 1933 as amended 

  




 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

this form 10k contains forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forwardlooking statements for many reasons including the risks described under the heading “risks related to our business” and elsewhere in this form 10k you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the information included under the headings “selected financial data” and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form 10k 

  

overview 

  

we are the largest global commercial real estate services firm based on 2003 revenue offering a full range of services to occupiers owners lenders and investors in office retail industrial multifamily and other commercial real estate assets as of december 31 2003 we operate in 48 countries with over 13500 employees in 220 offices providing commercial real estate services under the “cb richard ellis” brand name our business is focused on several service competencies including strategic advice and execution assistance for property leasing and sales forecasting valuations origination and servicing of commercial mortgage loans facilities and project management and real estate investment management we generate revenues both on a per project or transaction basis and from annual management fees 

  

when you read our financial statements and the information included in this section you should consider that we have experienced and continue to experience several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations and make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results we believe that the following material trends and uncertainties are most crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for such variances in the future 

  

macroeconomic conditions 

  

our operations are directly affected by actual and perceived trends in various national and economic conditions that affect global and regional markets for commercial real estate services including interest rates the availability of credit to finance commercial real estate transactions and the impact of tax laws affecting real estate periods of economic slowdown or recession rising interest rates a declining demand for real estate or the public perception that any of these events may occur can harm many of our business lines these economic conditions could result in a general decline in rents which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from property sales and leases in addition these conditions could lead to a decline in sales prices as well as a decline in demand for funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets an economic downturn or a significant increase in interest rates also could reduce the amount of loan originations and related servicing by the commercial mortgage banking business if the brokerage and mortgage banking businesses are negatively impacted it is likely that our other lines of business would also suffer due to the relationship among the various business lines further as a result of our debt level and the terms of our existing debt instruments our exposure to adverse general economic conditions is heightened 

  

during 2002 and 2001 we were adversely affected by the slowdown in the global economy which negatively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused a decline in our leasing activities within the united states which was 

  

only partially offset by improved overall revenues in europe and asia moreover in part because of the terrorist attacks on september 11 2001 and the subsequent conflict with iraq the economic climate in the united states became very uncertain which had an adverse effect on commercial real estate market conditions and in turn affected our operating results for 2002 and 2001 during 2003 economic conditions in the united states improved which positively impacted the commercial real estate market generally this caused an improvement in our americas sales and leasing activities we expect this trend to continue in the near term 

  

effects of prior acquisitions 

  

a significant component of our historical revenue growth has occurred through acquisitions including our acquisition of insignia financial group inc on july 23 2003 our management believes that most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income both as a result of transactionrelated expenses and charges and the difficulties of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems into our own for example we experienced a significant number of transactionrelated expenses in connection with both our acquisition of insignia in 2003 and our acquisition of cb richard ellis services inc in 2001 and we have incurred costs in connection with the integration of insignia’s business lines as well as accounting and other systems into our own 

  

international operations 

  

we have made significant acquisitions of nonus companies and may acquire additional foreign companies in the future as we increase our foreign operations fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we will be subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results in addition fluctuations in currencies relative to the us dollar may make it more difficult to perform periodtoperiod comparisons of our reported results of operations lastly our international operations are subject to among other things political instability and changing regulatory environments which may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations 

  

basis of presentation 

  

recent significant acquisitions and dispositions

deferred compensation plan obligations 

  

each participant in our deferred compensation plan or dcp is allowed to defer a portion of his or her compensation for distribution generally either after his or her employment with us ends or on a future date at least three years after the deferral election date the investment alternatives available to participants include two interest index funds and an insurance fund in which gains and losses on deferrals are measured by one or more of approximately 30 mutual funds in addition prior to our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 participants were entitled to invest their deferrals in stock fund units that 

  

entitled the participants to receive future distributions of shares of cb richard ellis services common stock except for the stock funds units all deferrals under the dcp represent obligations to make future cash payments effective january 1 2004 we closed the dcp to new participants currently the dcp is to accepting compensation deferrals from participants who have a balance meet the eligibility requirements and elect to participate up to a maximum annual contribution amount of 250000 per participant we are currently reviewing the future status of this plan 

  

because a substantial majority of the deferrals under the dcp have a distribution date based upon the end of the relevant participant’s employment with us we have an ongoing obligation to make distributions to these participants as they leave our employment as the level of employee departures is not predictable the timing of these obligations also is not predictable accordingly we may face significant unexpected cash funding obligations in the future if a larger number of our employees leave our employment than we expect 

  

pension liability 

  

our subsidiaries based in the united kingdom maintain two defined benefit pension plans to provide retirement benefits to existing and former employees participating in the plans with respect to these plans our historical policy has been to contribute annually an amount to fund pension cost as actuarially determined by an independent pension consulting firm and as required by applicable laws and regulations our contributions to these plans are invested and if these investments do not perform in the future as well as we expect we will be required to provide additional funding to cover the shortfall 

  

other obligations and commitments 

  

in connection with the sale of real estate investment assets by insignia to island on july 23 2003 insignia agreed to maintain letter of credit support for real estate investment assets that were subject to the purchase agreement until the earlier of 1 the third anniversary of the completion of the sale 2 the date on which the letter of credit is no longer required pursuant to the applicable real estate investment asset agreement or 3 the completion of a sale of the relevant underlying real estate investment asset as of december 31 2003 an aggregate of approximately 102 million of this letter of credit support remained outstanding under the purchase agreement also in connection with the sale insignia agreed to maintain a 13 million guarantee of a repayment obligation with respect to one of the real estate investment assets island fund agreed to reimburse us for 50 of any draws against these letters of credit or the repayment guarantee while they are outstanding and delivered a letter of credit to us in the amount of approximately 29 million as security for island fund’s reimbursement obligation as a result of this reimbursement obligation we effectively retain potential liability for 50 of any future draws against these letters of credit and the repayment guarantee however there can be no assurance that island fund will be able to reimburse us in the event of any draws against the letters of credit or the repayment guarantee or that island fund’s future reimbursement obligations will not exceed the amount of the letter of credit provided to us by island fund 

  

one of our subsidiaries previously executed an agreement with fannie mae to initially fund the purchase of a commercial mortgage loan portfolio using proceeds from its rfc line of credit subsequently a 100 participation in the loan portfolio was sold to fannie mae and we retained the credit risk on the first 2 of losses incurred on the underlying portfolio of commercial mortgage loans the current loan portfolio balance is 986 million and we have collateralized a portion of our obligations to cover the first 1 of losses through a letter of credit in favor of fannie mae for a total of approximately 10 million the other 1 is covered in the form of a guarantee to fannie mae 

  

we had outstanding letters of credit totaling 226 million as of december 31 2003 excluding letters of credit related to our outstanding indebtedness approximately 108 million of these letters of credit secure certain office leases and are outstanding pursuant to the revolving credit facility under our amended and restated credit agreement an additional 108 million of these letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement with island described above and are outstanding pursuant to a reimbursement agreement with the bank of nova scotia under this agreement we may issue up to a maximum of approximately 110 million of letters of credit outstanding at any one time and the outstanding letters of credit are secured by the same assets of ours that secure our amended and restated credit agreement the remaining outstanding letters of credit have been issued pursuant to a credit agreement with wells fargo bank which is also secured by the same assets of ours that secured our amended and restated credit agreement for the fannie mae letter of credit described above the outstanding letters of credit as of december 31 2003 expire at varying dates through august 31 2004 however we are obligated to renew the letters of credit related to the revolving credit facility until 2023 the letters of credit related to the island purchase agreement until as late as july 23 2006 and the fannie mae letters of credit until our obligation to cover potential credit losses is satisfied 

  

we had guarantees totaling 106 million as of december 31 2003 which consisted primarily of guarantees of property debt as well as the obligations to island and fannie mae discussed above generally the guarantees remain outstanding until certain conditions have been satisfied 

  

an important part of the strategy for our investment management business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients as of december 31 2003 we had committed 266 million to fund future coinvestments we expect that approximately 23 million of these commitments will be funded during 2004 in addition to required future capital contributions some of the co investment entities may request additional capital from us and our subsidiaries holding investments in those assets and the failure to provide these contributions could have adverse consequences to our interests in these investments 

  

seasonality 

  

a significant portion of our revenue is seasonal which affects your ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarterbyquarter basis historically this seasonality has caused our revenue operating income net income and cash flow from operating activities to be lower in the first two quarters and higher in the third and fourth quarters of each year the concentration of earnings and cash flow in the fourth quarter is due to an industrywide focus on completing transactions toward the fiscal yearend this has historically resulted in lower profits or a loss in the first and second quarters with profits growing or losses decreasing in each subsequent quarter 

  

inflation 

  

our revenue commissions and other variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by real estate market supply and demand which may be affected by general economic conditions including inflation however to date we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations 

  

application of critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts the estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that management believes to be reasonable actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we record real estate commissions on sales upon close of escrow or upon transfer of title real estate commissions on leases are generally recorded as income once we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement a typical commission agreement provides that we earn a portion of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant while the remaining portions of the lease commission is earned at a later date usually upon tenant occupancy the existence of any significant future contingencies will result in the delay of recognition of revenue until such contingencies are satisfied for example if we do not earn all or a portion of the lease commission until the tenant pays its first month’s rent and the lease agreement provides the tenant with a free rent period we delay revenue recognition until cash rent is paid by the tenant investment management and property management fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements appraisal fees are recorded after services have been rendered loan origination fees are recognized at the time the loan closes and we have no significant remaining obligations for performance in connection with the transaction while loan servicing fees are recorded to revenue as monthly principal and interest payments are collected from mortgagors other commissions consulting fees and referral fees are recorded as income at the time the related services have been performed unless significant future contingencies exist 

  

in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade receivables we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer’s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends including the aging of receivables balances in addition to these individual assessments in general outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are more than 180 days overdue are fully provided for 

  

principles of consolidation 

  

the accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority owned and controlled subsidiaries additionally the consolidated financial statements for the period from january 1 to july 20 2001 include the accounts of cb richard ellis services prior to our acquisition in 2001 as cb richard ellis services is considered our “predecessor” for purposes of regulation sx the equity attributable to minority shareholders’ interests in subsidiaries is shown separately in our consolidated balance sheets included elsewhere in this filing all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 

  

our investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but do not control are accounted for under the equity method accordingly our share of the earnings of these equitymethod basis companies is included in consolidated net income all other investments held on a longterm basis are valued at cost less any impairment in value 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

goodwill mainly represents the excess of the purchase price paid by us over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in our acquisition of cb richard ellis services in 2001 and our acquisition of insignia financial group in 2003 other intangible assets include trademarks which were separately identified as a result of the 2001 acquisition as well as a trade name separately identified as a result of the insignia acquisition representing the richard ellis trade name in 

  

the united kingdom that was owned by insignia prior to the insignia acquisition both the trademarks and the trade name are not being amortized and have indefinite estimated useful lives other intangible assets also include backlog which represents the fair value of insignia’s net revenue backlog as of july 23 2003 that was acquired as part of the insignia acquisition the net revenue backlog consists of the net commission receivable on insignia’s revenue producing transactions which were at various stages of completion prior to the insignia acquisition net revenue backlog is being amortized as cash is received or upon final closing of these pending transactions the remaining other intangible assets primarily include management contracts loan servicing rights franchise agreements and a trade name which are all being amortized on a straightline basis over estimated useful lives ranging up to 20 years 

  

we fully adopted sfas no 142 “ goodwill and other intangible assets ” effective january 1 2002 this statement requires us to perform at least annually an assessment of impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives based on assumptions and estimates of fair value and future cash flow information we perform an annual assessment of our goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for impairment based in part on a thirdparty valuation as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year we also assess goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from future cash flows we completed our required annual impairment tests as of october 1 2003 and 2002 and determined that no impairment existed as of those dates 

  

new accounting pronouncements 

  

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 46 or fin 46 “ consolidation of variable interest entities” this standard clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “ consolidated financial statements ” and addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities fin 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risk among the parties involved this statement is immediately effective for variable interest entities created or in which an enterprise obtains an interest after january 31 2003 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued a revised version of fin 46 or fin 46r among other things the revision clarifies the definition of a variable interest entity exempts most entities that are businesses from the scope of fin 46r and delays the effective date of the revised standard to no later than the end of the first reporting period ending after december 15 2003 for special purpose entities and march 15 2004 for all other types of entities the adoption of this interpretation has not had and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 149 “ amendment to statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities ” sfas no 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 133 sfas no 149 is applied prospectively and is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 except for sfas no 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to june 15 2003 and certain provisions relating to forward purchases and sales on securities that do not yet exist the adoption of this statement has not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “ accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity ” sfas no 150 establishes standards for the classification and measurement of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity the financial instruments affected include mandatorily redeemable stock certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock sfas no 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and must be applied to our existing financial instruments effective july 1 2003 on october 29 2003 the fasb deferred indefinitely the provisions of paragraphs 9 and 10 and related guidance in the appendices of this pronouncement as they apply to mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests the adoption of the effective provisions of sfas no 150 have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2003 the fasb issued a revised version of sfas no 132 “employers’ disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits” the revised statement retains the disclosure requirements contained in sfas no 132 and requires additional disclosures about the assets obligations cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans we have adopted this statement for the year ended december 31 2003 in addition we expect to adopt additional disclosures for our uk pension plans during 2004

the following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our exposure to market risk consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations 

  

exchange rates 

  

approximately 302 of our business was transacted in local currencies of foreign countries for the year ended december 31 2003 the majority of which included the euro the british pound sterling the hong kong dollar the singapore dollar and the australian dollar during 2003 the us dollar dropped against many of the currencies in which we conduct business we attempt to manage our exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign countries only at levels necessary for operating purposes however we do not enter into agreements to hedge the risks associated with translation of foreign currencies into us dollars as a result fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported amounts of our total assets and liabilities which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the exchange rate in effect on the respective balance sheet dates and our total revenues and expenses which are reflected in our financial statements as translated into us dollars for each financial reporting period at the monthly average exchange rate for example during 2003 foreign currency translation had a 544 million positive impact on our total revenue and a 473 million negative impact on our total costs of services and operating administrative and other expenses 

  

we routinely monitor our exposure to currency exchange rate changes in connection with transactions and sometimes enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts to limit our exposure to such transactions as appropriate we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “ accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities ” as amended by sfas no 138 “ accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities ” when accounting for any such contracts in the normal course of business we sometimes utilize derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange exposure resulting from intercompany loans we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and accordingly do not engage in any speculative activities with respect to foreign currency at december 31 2003 we were not a party to any such contracts 

  

interest rates 

  

we manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt our fixed and variable rate longterm debt at december 31 2003 consisted of the following 

  

      

we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt if interest rates were to increase by 35 basis points approximately 10 of the weighted average variable rate at december 31 2003 the net impact would be a decrease of 21 million on annual pretax income and cash provided by operating activities for the twelve months ended december 31 2003 

  

based on dealers’ quotes at december 31 2003 the estimated fair values of our 9¾ senior notes and our 11¼ senior subordinated notes were 2220 million and 2565 million respectively there was no trading activity for our 16 senior notes due in 2011 the carrying value of our 16 senior notes as of december 31 2003 totaled 355 million estimated fair values for the term loans under our senior secured credit facilities and our remaining longterm debt are not presented because we believe that they are not materially different from book value primarily because the majority of our remaining debt is based 

  

on variable rates that approximate terms that could be obtained at december 31 2003 

  

we historically have not entered into agreements with third parties for the purpose of hedging our exposure to changes in interest rates although we do not have any current intentions to enter into such agreements in the future we may do so in connection with our ongoing assessment of our interest rate exposure if we do enter into any such agreements we would do so for risk management purposes only and not to engage in speculative activities with respect to interest rates we would apply statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as amended by sfas no 138 “accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities when accounting for any such derivatives
